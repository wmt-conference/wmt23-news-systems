5 General structure
In the English language, all numbers with 0x are represented in the decimal system, whereas those without 0x are represented in the hexadecimal system.
The encoded digits in the appendix are represented in the decimal system, while the other digits are represented in the hexadecimal system.
The single-byte portion uses the encoding structure of GB/T 11383 I 1989, so that the 0x00 to 0x7F bytes are used.
The binary digits are represented by two eight-digit binary bit strings, starting with 0x81 and 0xFE, followed by 0x40 and 0x7E and 0x80 and 0xFE respectively.
The four-byte part is used in GB/Work 11383 1 1989 Not used 0x30 1 0x39 As a suffix to the two-byte extension, the encoding range is 0x81308130 1 0xFE39FE39 。
The first four-byte character is encoded as 0x81 by 0xFE; the second is encoded as 0x30 by 0x39; the third is encoded as 0x81 by 0xFE; the fourth is encoded as 0x30 by 0x39 。 i.e.: 0x813081301 by 0x81308139; 0x813082301 by 0x81308239 by 0x8130FEFE301 by 0x8130FE39 ; 0x813181301 by 0x81318139 ; Oo2douolag0c 0URo23061393 by 0xFE39301 by 0xFE3939 。

DESCRIPTION C and C++ compilers are integrated. They all handle input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.
The source file suffix identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix name controls the default setting:
gcc considers the preprocessed file ((.i) to be a c file and sets the connection to be in the form of c,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c++ file and sets the connection to the c++ form.
The source file suffix indicates the language type and the operation in the later stages:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compiling and assembly
C C++ source code; preprocessed, compiled, compiled
.cc C++ source code; preprocessed, compiled and compiled
CXX C++ source code; preprocessing, compilation and assembly
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessed, compiled and compiled
.i Preprocessed c files; compiled, compiled
.ii Preprocessed c++ files; compiled, compiled
.s compiles the source program of the language; compiles
Compilation of source language programs; preprocessing, compilation and assembly
.h preprocessor files; files that do not normally appear on the command line with other suffixes are passed to the linker. Typically include:
.0 Object file
The archive file is a file that contains the information about the author of the book.
Connection is always the last step, unless the -cec-, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the entire process).
At the connection stage, all corresponding.e files, -1 library files, unidentified file names ((including the specified.o H flag files and.a library files) are passed to the connector options in order from the command line
The option must be given separately: de'is completely different from `-d-r '.
Most ` -=E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
The format is not the default, but is listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in later chapters.
Code generation option
Overall option
Specify that the language of the file to be entered afterwards is language (rather than the default option from the file name suffix).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is encountered.
Turn off any language explicit, so the file is processed according to the file name suffix (RE AS E ` -x' option).
If only a portion of the four stages (Preprocess, Compile, Compile, Connect) is operated, the ` -x' option (or Ah after the filename) can be used to tell geo where to start, and the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or compile source files, ETER. In the absence of ERA ATI, GCC is used by `.o' to replace the source file name with the post-level `.ec filename. Other options can be used to choose the name.
The targeted files.
The compilation is stopped and no compilation is done.
The compiler for GNU does not have this problem, since the compilers for those systems cannot read data from the pipeline, and the compiler is able to accept the C "dialect": support for C programs that conform to the ANSI standard.
This turns off certain keywords in GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax that are indicated as acceptable and rarely used, and disables them despite the fact that they are used in all standard libraries. The main function returns an int value, typical of almost all programs except the kernel.
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', C-style handling --- i.e. no indication of the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).
Normally, a function like foo would mean that the argument is empty in C++.
The section lists here are removed to try to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.
We have removed the details so that when the content is out of date, people won't be able to HERI it.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the '∀ -traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing this to be assigned.
The result of this is the same as the result of the '`-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
In particular, the preprocessor mentioned above, but not including the other effects of the '`-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the character `$' in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the option '∀-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' to explicitly prohibit the use of the '∀$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of the ant type to the enumeration type (MEF c++).
In normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows the conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal-templates generates a smaller code (limited to c++) for the template declaration, by generating a copy of each template function only where they are defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.
When a program compiles with `-fexternal-templates', all template instantiations are external types. You must have the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be done through typedef, which cites each instance as needed.
Correspondingly, if the default option ` -fno-exteznal-templates' is used when compiling, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except the constructor subfunction and the mnew or delete member operator) are treated as virtual functions of the class in which they are located.
This does not imply that every call to a member function will pass through the internal null table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; this is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch Allows type mismatch of the second and third parameters of a conditional expression.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-is-variable allowing this to be assigned (only for c++).
The incorporation of user-customized free storage management mechanisms into c++ makes the attributable '`this' seem out of date.
Therefore, by default, this assignment is invalid inside the class member function.
However, for backwards compatibility, you can enable this by using the '`-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char Defines char as a symbolless type, like unsigned char.
Each machine has its own default char type. It can be either an unsigned char or a signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the symbolic nature of the data.
But many programs have been written using only simple char, and the terminal block is either symmetrical (or symmetricalless, depending on the target machine that wrote the program).
This option, and its antiderivative, allows the program to work on the corresponding default.
The type of char should always be clearly defined as a signed char or an unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If there is no explicit declaration of the ` signed' or "unsigned' modifier, these options are used to define a bitfield with or without a symbol.
By default, bit fields are signed because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed, however, if the '`-traditional' option is specified, the bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in a writable data segment, and does not give it special treatment.
This is to make it compatible with some older programs, which are thinking that changing the string constant is a very bad idea, and the '`-traditional' option has the same effect.
Summary of the execution
The impact of coronavirus on the drug market
The impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has left healthcare systems in a state of near collapse, and restrictive measures imposed by governments have caused severe disruption in the global economy.
The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it could have far-reaching consequences.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and basic chemicals.
Traffickers who cannot cross the border due to travel restrictions may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.
The transformation of the coronavirus is unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and shifted their patterns of use to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut budgets related to drugs.
Interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard if governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way.
In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to act.
The report also highlights the fact that the number of countries where drugs are smuggled via commercial airlines is high, and that these countries are expected to be the most directly affected by the drug trafficking activity.
Consumers have been known to carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their backpacks or hidden in their personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger transportation in almost all places, the supply of drugs using commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain is also affected, the use of darknet and cargo mail for trafficking activities may increase.
In the long run, the economic recession and related closures could disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, to develop drug addiction disorders, and to turn to illicit activities related to drugs, whether in production or transportation.
The drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.
These changes could quickly take root and become a new reality in many communities as the government's ability to respond declines.
Expansion and complexity
Growth of the market
Population growth patterns partly explain why the market is expanding
Drug use has been increasing in all parts of the world, both in terms of overall numbers and in terms of the proportion of drug users in the world's population.
In 2009, an estimated 210 million people used drugs, or 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, compared to an estimated 269 million in 2018, or 5.3% of the population.
Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has increased much faster than in developed countries.
This reflects to some extent the difference in overall population growth over this period, with 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
The largest proportion of drug users are adolescents and young adults.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets
In both developed and developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas, where more than half of the world's population now lives, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more prominent.
Increasing wealth is associated with an increase in drug use, but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest people in the world, and drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
The drug is also linked to the richest parts of the world, where it is used in the production of drugs such as cocaine.
In the same way, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthy in different countries.
However, the highest rates of drug addiction are found in people with lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a small number of countries show a link between harmful patterns of drug use, disease and low income.
These patterns seem less common in the wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints caused by the global coronavirus pneumonia crisis are likely to increase the risk for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked in the past to an increase in drug use, an epidemic that has already forced tens of millions of people around the world out of work.
The pandemic of coronavirus pneumonia could lead to more farmers or illegal crop cultivation, or because of the reduced control capacity of the state authorities, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.
The associated restrictions on coronavirus pneumonia have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which may have increased maritime trafficking, with a lower risk of interception at sea and more trafficking than by air or land.
Recently, there have been reports of cocaine being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but the market for potentially harmful new opioids is growing and becoming more complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of drugs is also growing rapidly.
The domestic market of the Member States is home to approximately 500 new active substances per year.
Currently, the majority of these are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor activators and a small number of opioids.
Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Opioid-like new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2% of the total number of new psychoactive substance categories identified in 2014, but this figure rose to 9% by 2018 [2].
Many of the newer psychoactive substances, such as opioids, are analogues of fentanyl, whose medicinal effects and harms have been demonstrated to cause overdose deaths in North America and other regions, but to a lesser degree.
In North America, fentanyl is used as a hallucinogen for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and in the manufacture of counterfeit medicinal opiates.
Some evidence suggests that injection of new psychoactive substances (NPS) is also a phenomenon in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were laced with the new psychoactive substance, mercury, which produces an exciting effect
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may become more entrenched in vulnerable groups
The market for a single class of novel psychoactive substances has hardly ever been large.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabis is a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with the majority of countries identifying synthetic cannabis as the main challenge.
The regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug makers to innovate, and many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as ketamine, methylamine and methamphetamine have been placed under international control.
Drug dealers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives to not only loosely regulated substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent regulation, the so-called "special-purpose" precursors.
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia are likely to further squeeze out poisoners who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this is already a reality: in March 2020, it was reported that a shortage of methylamine precursors imported from East Asia had led to higher prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing
Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opioids seized by the Russian Federation authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has decreased significantly.
But the market for stimulants seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cassettes, including methamphetamine and a-methamphetamine, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities have reported a sharp increase in the number of recently seized clandestine processing points for the manufacture of various illicit drugs, which more than doubled in two years to 152 in 2018.
Growth in Afghanistan and Iraq's methamphetamine market
As early as 2012, investigations of hospital, prison and other staff revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern alongside benzodiazepines and quetiapine.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with users reporting that cannabis is more difficult to obtain than methamphetamine or methylphenidate.
Recently, Iraqi authorities discovered several methamphetamine processing sites, and the Anesthesia Control Board has expressed concern over the large-scale import of pseudo-methamphetamine preparations, which are used as precursors in one methamphetamine processing site.
In Afghanistan, the manufacture of methamphetamine appears to have started in 2014.
Since then, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily increasing.
However, the first half of 2019 saw a sharp increase of 657 kg of manganese compared to the previous year.
The large quantities of methamphetamine seized in other countries, which are believed to be of Afghan origin, also indicate that production in the country is rising rapidly.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis have seen an increase in its use.
The manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use is permitted in 11 jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical use of cannabis.
In the first two states to pass legislation, Colorado and Washington, non-medical use of marijuana by adults has increased, especially in the past month, and daily or near-daily use has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that the use of cannabis in Uruguay has increased since 2011, with the use almost doubling last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also shows that usage is increasing as the legal market expands from 2018 to 2019.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is legalization the reason behind the global plunge in cannabis seeds?
In 2018, global cannabis straw harvests fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decline in harvests in North America, which has declined by 84% over the past 10 years.
In comparison, seizures in the rest of the world nearly doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at opening up the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
The effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances in the country is still difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different rates of new psychoactive substance use.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following the adoption of national legislation.
The harm of legal and illegal drug markets to vulnerable groups The availability of opioids, medicinal drugs used for pain management and palliative care, is unevenly distributed across regions, mainly in high-income countries.
In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical use were in high-income countries.
About 50% of the world's population lives in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12% of the world's population.
It is estimated that 88% of the world's population lives in low- and middle-income countries, but less than 10% of the world's population consumes medicinal opioids.
Barriers to access to prescription opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug-related diseases, with 35.6 million people suffering from drug-related diseases in 2018.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. Research in high-income countries confirms this, and in these studies, the socioeconomic trajectories of individuals that are disadvantaged are associated with the risk of drug use disorders, not just their situation at a particular point in time.
Drug use disorders also exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus contributing to the vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to the stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, minorities and migrants, diverse groups of sexual orientation, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug-related illnesses or have problems accessing treatment services.
The last decade has seen an increase in the impact of harmful drug use on wider society, according to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death.
The global disability-adjusted life expectancy attributed to drug use increased by 17% between 2007 and 2018.
The disability-adjusted life years associated with liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, common among injection drug users, are particularly high, with a 40% increase.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited data from around the world suggests that binge drinking may be a significant factor in deaths.
But alcohol seems to be more important than drugs in violence.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this link can be attributed in part to a variety of intermediate factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
Where there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out in a non-violent manner.
In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depends less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or incarceration of known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group over another.
The latest trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used drug, and opioids are the most harmful
It is estimated that in 2018, there were 189 million people who used cannabis, making it the most used drug in the world.
In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
The dangers of opioids are being ignored because of the low number of users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the 21 million years of life lost in the United States are believed to be due to disability or premature death caused by drug use.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Kumamoto; in North America, it is Fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by the availability and low cost of the substance.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States were related to fentanyl.
Canada reports similar results, but with lower numbers.
The unpredictability of fentanyl in the illicit drug market is partly responsible for fentanyl overdose deaths.
The market for non-medical use of quinoa has grown significantly in West, Central and North Africa.
In the region, treatment for the use of curcumin is increasingly being used by patients with the disease.
In 2017, the global quantity of the Khumar has increased significantly, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.
But in 2018, global catches dropped to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating the use of kumquats.
The two crises are due to the simplicity and low cost of manufacturing, as well as the lack of international regulation of Quimado and many of its Fentanyl analogues or precursors.
What makes the crisis worse is that these substances are available in both the drug and illicit markets, making it harder to detect and prevent their abuse.
Increased Use of Stimulants
The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasingly used in its main markets.
In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as cocaine became more popular in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, around 27 million people used ketamine, with methylamine being the most commonly used ketamine stimulant in South East Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine coexist, sometimes interchangeably, such that as the use of one drug increases, the use of the other drug decreases, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the demands of the same market.
Coronavirus pneumonia increases the risk of injecting drug users
It is estimated that 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018 and that around 10% of HIV infections worldwide were caused by injecting drugs.
More than 1 million people injecting drugs are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million suffer from hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of them from hepatitis C-related liver disease, and most of the hepatitis C in injecting drug users remains untreated.
5 Opioid shortages caused by restrictive measures for necrotizing pneumonia may lead users to substitute more easily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
More harmful uses may occur as some users switch to injections or inject more frequently.

EU officials: Reception process is a bottleneck - China News Network
EU summits fight over refugee policy, EU officials: bottlenecks at every step of the admission process
According to AFP, at the latest EU summit on February 10, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that EU leaders had agreed to a stricter policy on illegal immigration to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The move was reportedly a response to the EU's growing concern about illegal immigration, which is now at the heart of the EU's problem with the small number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be returned.
According to the summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds to strengthen the external borders, including infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and its member states are still in dispute over the payment of fencing fees and other issues.
The EU funds will not cover the costs, Vanderleien has repeatedly said.
But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU can share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along the external border, it will free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
European officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee admission process, that limited admission capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states are unable to stop refugees from submitting a huge number of asylum applications in EU countries, and that the EU's refugee admission system is in near-permanent crisis, according to the European website Euractiv.
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, almost half as many as the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also agreed on a principle of subsidiarity, whereby EU countries can return illegal migrants to their home countries based on a judgment of a court in another member state.
In addition, EU leaders also agreed to increase the use of the concept of safe countries, which would pave the way for the EU to develop a common list, the report said.

US upgrade of silicon chips hits global semiconductor industry hard - China news
Recently, the US war on Huawei chips has escalated significantly, with the Netherlands and Japan agreeing to start regulating the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China under pressure from the US. Foreign media reports have reported that the US government is considering cutting all ties between US suppliers and Huawei companies, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei. The Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting US investment in the sensitive Chinese technology industry.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped its efforts to combat China's silicon chip development, while cracking down on China's semiconductor supply chain, while building a semiconductor industry chain alliance to make China look like China, in an attempt to completely open up China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to establish a silicon technology alliance with South Korea, or to establish a four-party alliance with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan in China, or to establish a semiconductor industry chain link by means of the US-Japanese-Indian-Australian Quadrilateral Mechanism and the Printing Sea Economic Framework, the United States is trying to build a closed production supply chain cycle led by the United States by introducing politicization, militarization, and weaponization.
However, the US's tactical victory over China was also a blow to the enemy's self-defense.
Recently, PanLinx, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that it would lay off 1,300 full-time employees and 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters, due to the latest round of export bans on Chinese chip manufacturing equipment.
The global photogrammetry giant Asma Holding, a Dutch company, recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
After the US government cracked down on industries such as chips and semiconductors in China, many US companies were hit hard, including developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of crystal manufacturing equipment, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The US is supposedly cracking down on China's advanced semiconductor industry, but instead dragging down the global semiconductor industry and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, which has long formed a tightly linked global semiconductor industry chain.
According to experts, the entire production process of semiconductor products based on specialized division of labor requires crossing the borders of countries more than 70 times, and the entire process takes 100 days.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong base, it is weak in manufacturing capacity, especially in advanced manufacturing processes, and heavily relies on East Asia.
Even if the US is able to steer the advanced chip supply chain towards a US-led small-circle regionalisation, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor industry is difficult to change.
The US is reshaping the semiconductor industry chain from China to China, creating a new global semiconductor industry.
The chip industry is the core of the future of the global industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, including the introduction of the Innovation and Competition Act, the US Competition Act, the US Chip and Science Act of 2022, the use of technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership; the use of allied technology to lure chip manufacturers such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to enter the US plant, and the efforts to ensure the US's global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the US has indeed created problems for China's chip industry and related industries, and reaped real benefits.
But in the long run, the hysterical US pushback against China's chip industry, which has been making breakthroughs, will cost it a huge Chinese market, and ultimately weaken the innovative will and ability of US tech companies, and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The first individual pension asset sales mark the official opening of individual pension investors to purchase assets through their individual pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (BCR) issued a temporary measure to regulate the personal pension business of commercial banks and financial institutions in Hong Kong.
The Participant's Personal Pension Fund Account is used to purchase Personal Pension Products such as Personal Pension Savings, Personal Pension Property Management, Personal Pension Insurance Products, Personal Pension Public Fund Products.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the National Tax Administration issued a notice to start implementing the personal pension system in Beijing, Tianjin, and 36 pioneering cities and regions such as Shijiazhuang, Xiong'an New Area, Shanxi and Jining City in Hebei.
As of the end of 2022, there were 19.54 million participants and 6.13 million contributors to the individual pension system, with a total amount of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only offered three categories of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products and personal pension fund.
How should investors choose now that personal pension funds are also being pooled?
Experts from the R&D department of the bank said that the pilot-stage pension and personal pension products have three characteristics compared to other personal pension products.
The first is robustness, more robust risk management mechanisms, more robust investment strategies and philosophies, and the implementation of independent custody by non-parent third parties.
The second is long-term, the pilot phase of the term of the pension plan is 5 years or more, the next step of the personal pension plan, the minimum holding period is in principle 1 year, encouraging holding more than 3 years.
The third is the universality, the threshold for purchasing products is low, the starting point is generally 1 yuan, some are as low as 0.01 yuan, the cost of hosting, administration fees and other fees for products are more favorable.
Experts point out that investors should choose based on the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Individual pension savings have long term, high interest rate, high security characteristics, suitable for people with low risk tolerance; Individual pension insurance products are heavily secured, more suitable for people who cannot bear the investment risk, can accept stable returns; and Individual pension property management products and public fund products are not secured and do not guarantee returns, there is some investment risk, but the expected return is high, suitable for people with a certain financial knowledge, risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should be free of the crisis of trust - China News Network
Another big gym with thunderstorms?
Recently, the issue of fitness members' rights in well-known fitness organizations has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally, and then rumors about the closure of the runway caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of the Public Security and Human Resources departments.
Finally, the agency's relevant officials responded by promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its employees and members, and the storm was only calmed.
The first reaction of many members was that it was a big deal, but the reason why some of the stores in individual fitness centers had problems with operations, temporarily closed, and consumers should have been calm and wait for the problem to be solved is because they were not satisfied with the results.
The health club membership advocacy wave is a deep-seated crisis of confidence in the industry.
The underlying logic behind the development of the traditional gyms in the country is the widespread adoption of pre-paid models, which eliminate the money that users cannot earn.
The new store, which is supposed to be a circular business, is a cash-flow-generating business, which is not a stable profit-making model.
The negative news about the gymnastics track and other industries has been a frequent source of negative news, which has had a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From a market perspective, gyms are certainly a lucrative business.
The gymnastics track has been the focus of capital attention, despite its ups and downs.
The number of data shows that the market is continuing to warm up, with the heat rising in areas such as the consumption of literature.
Specifically, the fitness market is growing with the steady improvement of the living standards of the residents, the concept of healthy living is deeply rooted in the hearts of people, and the fitness industry has a lot of potential.
The more the situation improves, the more the industry needs to focus on quality development.
However, the blind optimism of some institutions about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, just emerged from the crisis, and sounded the bell of opening up the territory, putting a part of the financing capital into the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that the pandemic has affected many institutions in recent years, with many departures, industry reshuffles, and powerful companies have now selectively increased their acquisition efforts and reorganized, which is not a new opportunity.
However, if the fitness market is to enter a virtuous cycle and move forward, the industry must change its traditional model and change its operating strategy.
Only by fighting hard and rebuilding the trust and security of consumers can we truly win the market and win the future.
The fitness industry needs to focus on optimizing services and developing high quality to secure users, rather than building new stores to take over the market.
First, the service is the way to retain users.
The gym is a service industry, and its essence is to adhere to the user-oriented approach, to be tightly around the needs of users, and to focus on the improvement of service quality.
Second, the user experience should be improved through digital transformation.
The popular online gym model, for example, allows users to pay by the hour and choose their own location.
At the same time, the use of physical and exercise data can be used effectively to meet social needs and complete the service loop from online to offline.
No private tutoring, no huge annual membership, less fear of the gyms and more confidence in the gyms.
The project is also about exploring the possibility of a more diverse workforce.
Today, sports consumption has moved from a single service to a scenario consumption, fitness clubs are expected to become a new entry point for consumption, surrounding products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment needed for fitness or will be a new lever to provide consumers with more choice.
The world is changing.

Nanjing property market to pay for the price difference - China News Network
Yangon Evening News (Reporter Ma Zhongbo) Yangon Evening News / Zhuhai News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the price guarantee agreement for the building, which has not been seen for more than ten years, has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A property in Jiangbei New District claims that the price difference compensates for the building, and that the developer is willing to buy the house for the owner and refund the price difference.
The price guarantee agreement has many conditions.
The property in Jiangbei New District is called the Bolian Zhongyuan Tai, and the owner, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a brick declaration when he was looking at the property last weekend.
The pictures he sent to reporters showed the developers of the property promising that if the preferential discount for other housing sources in the project is greater than the discount for previous purchases of housing for all housing sources purchased between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the purchase contract and until the delivery of the corresponding housing source, the developer can change the housing for the buyer and refund the difference in price.
Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a price guarantee agreement, the purpose is to make the buyer feel safe to go, without worrying about the development company's price reduction promotion, now that the price has been reduced, there is no time to go to the sales office, if not, it is really worrying.
Many buyers also believe that the price guarantee agreement is a good deal, even though it gives buyers a lot of money to settle their debts, but the conditions are not bad.
Ms. Liu, who is planning to buy a newly needed house in Jiangbei, said that the price of the house is first of all the same type of house, on the same floor, in the same unit, and the buyer can compare the price of the house with the price of the house, so the threshold is quite high.
Some buyers also believe that the information is asymmetrical, and that the sale does not exclude the possibility of an additional concession, which makes it difficult for the buyer to defend his rights.
The question of whether to keep the buyer is still to be seen.
The building was listed on the real estate website in November last year, with a total of 252 units in two floors, with a total area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, and a total of 39843 yuan / m2 for the average price of the fully renovated sale.
However, over two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the complex is 157, accounting for 62.3%, of which 128 units are on the 8th floor, 113 units are unsold, 44 of the 124 units on the 7th floor are unsold, and the total number of completed units in the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.
The market sources said that the price guarantee agreement was also used in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, in order to attract buyers, the company launched a price guarantee scheme, specifically promising the company that if the project's incentive margin expands within a year, the difference will be returned to the old owner.
In April 2011, nine other properties in Nanjing also offered to pay compensation for the difference in price.
The market is warming up, and a needle of heart-boosting medicine is needed.
Shen, a senior operator in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said that the price guarantee agreement is also one of the marketing methods of the real estate company.
He believes that developers need more confidence than home buyers, and that the introduction of the price guarantee agreement is actually encouraging them.
As for whether the buyers will be able to stay, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies, the loan threshold and so on, which remains to be seen.
Taiwan's economy starts off badly - China News Network
Export trade volume has been on a five-month high, manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) has been down for seven consecutive months, consumer price index (CPI) has seen a rise of 3 characters... Recently, Taiwan authorities have released economic data for January 2023 in a row.
Experts analyzed the economic performance of Taiwan in the first half of the year, and the growth pressure was not small.
Taiwan's exports in January were $31.51 billion, down 21.2% year-on-year, the fifth consecutive month of negative growth, according to the Taiwanese Ministry of Finance.
The export volume of 11 major export categories declined compared to the same period last year.
Plastics and their products, optical devices, were the worst affected, down 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components fell by 20.1% in the year, the biggest decline in 11 years.
Among them, the ICs fell by 18.3% a year, the biggest drop in 14 years.
The head of the statistics department, Juan Mena, said that this shows that the weakness in demand for consumer electronics has spread and the electronics industry is entering a correction period.
Taiwanese imports and exports doubled in January, to $2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years, according to statistics.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the decline in global terminal demand, the industry adjustment of inventory suppressed the willingness of manufacturers to buy raw materials, the export boom is unlikely to improve in the short term, and Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year is higher than expected.
According to the China Institute of Economic Research, the seasonally adjusted PMI for Taiwan's manufacturing industry was 40.4% in January, down 3.3 percentage points from December, the seventh consecutive month of contraction.
In the system of economic monitoring indicators, the PMI is the upward trend line at 50%, and the index is greater than 50%, representing an expansion in the economy, as opposed to contraction.
January Taiwan PMI Five components: new orders, production and employment contraction, delivery time decline of suppliers, and stock contraction.
The six largest industries reported total PMI contraction, with the following industries ranked by contraction rate: power pump machinery and equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optics industry (35.2%), chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation industry (42.6%) and food and textile industry (45.7%).
Taiwan's CPI rose by 3.04 percent in January, breaking the 3 percent mark it had seen since July last year, according to the Office of the Comptroller General of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
The price of vegetables has soared by 28.25%, a 17-month high.
The special commissioner of the Taipei Provincial Government, Cao Zhijian, said that the price increase was indeed higher than expected, excluding the Spring Festival factor, and the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71 percent compared to December last year, while inflationary pressure is still present and remains at a high point.
Experts are pessimistic about the Taiwanese economy, the reporting of the Taiwanese media, the report of the Taiwanese news agency, and the report of the Yahoo financial news.
Professor Yang Tan, from the Department of Economics at the Central University of Taiwan, said the export slump could cause cash flow problems for export manufacturers and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the decrease in orders has led to manufacturers cutting labor costs, affecting the labor market and household finances, which in turn has impacted consumer spending.
The Taiwan Institute of Economics researcher, Mr. Tan Da-chan, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States is uncertain this year, demand continues to contract, and Taiwan's export recession is expected to continue into the first half of the year.
Taiwan's economy is export-led and will suffer from a slowdown in exports, so the full-year growth will be lower than last year.
The importance of hydrogen as a driver of global recovery - China News Network
The Chinese economy has shown great resilience in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
Recent market expectations show that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
In an interview with the Huffington Post, Julio Ríos, a well-known Chinese expert and honorary advisor to China Policy Observatory, said that the current Chinese epidemic is entering a new phase of prevention and control, and the dynamism of economic and social development will be further released.
In the face of the shock of unexpected factors, China has responded with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, which fully reflect its economic resilience and management level, said Rios.
China is determined to expand its opening up to the outside world, while the internal dynamics of economic development are increasing, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are developing in tandem.
Every year, two national meetings are held in China, representing the members of the Communist Party of China to discuss the development plans of the country and the hot issues of the Communist Party, to gather consensus, to gather people's hearts and to gather wisdom, to add strength to China's development.
Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and is now entering a high-quality development stage.
The international community looks forward to China's wisdom and Chinese programs, and to China's development as a new opportunity for the world.
The Chinese government is pushing hard for technological innovation, injecting new impetus into economic and social development, investing more money, training talent and policy incentives, which will keep China vibrant in the new five-year plan, said Purios.
In Rio's view, reforming the economic system is a difficult task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China has used the strengths of the market economy and the superiority of the socialist system to take proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Around the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting the development of private enterprise, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing, adhering to innovative development, promoting employment, improving the income and living standards of the Chinese people, meeting the needs of the people's multi-layered and diversified consumption... China's complete, accurate and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, focusing on promoting high-quality development and building a new development pattern, will bring more growth opportunities to the world.

The recovery of the economy after the coronavirus pandemic is a common goal of the international community.
The unleashing of China's economic potential will bring more benefits to the world and become an important engine for global recovery.

The Chinese e-commerce industry is emerging with a new variable called "Changes", and how can we make the content of the goods "Wang Yi"?
Sharp, a financial journalist from China News
We started e-commerce late, but we realized from the beginning that it was important to have content to stand out from the millions of stores.
Fan Fang, a late 90s girl from Guangdong, now runs a nutrition store at the Xiang Electric Company, bringing a 30-year-old offline store online.
The video is a great way to learn about the history of the country, the history of the people who lived in the country, the history of the people who lived in the country, the history of the people who lived in the country, the history of the people who lived in the country, the history of the people who lived in the country.

She said: "The video of my cooking has attracted a lot of attention from netizens, many of them are interested in my cooking and want to cook with me, so the door is open".

With the development of short videos and live streaming services, people are entering a new phase of requirements and standards for content from e-commerce.
In the early days of live delivery, the live broadcaster often used low prices to attract customers, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, both the phenomenon of the Big V, such as the Hong Kong and Eastern Selection, and many unknown celebrities and businessmen in the vertical segment have emerged, who have improved long-term operating efficiency by continuously creating quality content that matches their brand tone.
According to Gao Yao, the head of Star Author Operations at Deng Xiaoping, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Deng Xiaoping in the past year, with a 252% increase in content creation and more than doubling their total revenue.
Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving and vibrant ecosystem of authors.

The report was analyzed and interpreted by Professor Liang Guo-ming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Peking Normal University and chairman of the Professional Committee on Economics and Management of the Chinese Media.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from the e-commerce consumer's ease of access to the e-commerce consumer's quality of e-commerce, and that quality, professional and differentiated content is the e-commerce industry's hard currency.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and catalyst for the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, KOL (key opinion leader) has become the standard in e-commerce live broadcasting.
Looking ahead to the future of e-commerce, Guo Ming made two suggestions.
One is from the perspective of improving the content structure, promoting the overall improvement of the ecological health level and quality of e-commerce content, creating positive content creation and management standards, and achieving the content ecological health system index and dynamic balance of the e-commerce industry.
Another is the synergy and co-creation of value in the external environment to achieve a healthy development of the content e-commerce industry from the external ecological point of view.
The future e-commerce industry also needs more data and artificial intelligence support to form predictions for future development stability; In addition, to provide more regulated and healthy growth space for merchants, to realize the value synergy of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and to co-create a healthy content ecosystem.

Xinhua commentator: Advancing China-style modernization is a systemic engineering, Xi Jinping's keynote speech at the opening of the 20th Party Spirit Seminar
China's modernization is a systematic process: Xi Jinping's keynote speech at the opening of the 20th Party Spirit Seminar
The Chinese government has not yet responded to the report.
The Chinese modernization is a systemic project that requires overall planning, system planning, overall promotion, correct handling of top-level design and practice exploration, strategy and strategy, compliance and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and openness to a series of important relationships.
At the opening ceremony of the 20th Seminar of the Party and Socialist Ideas of Xi Jinping in the New Era of China, where members of the Central Committee of the New Progress, candidate members of the Central Committee and key leadership cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels learned to implement Xi Jinping's socialist ideas and the party's twenty major spiritual workshops, General Secretary Xi Jinping grasped the rules of modernisation construction, elaborated on a series of important relationships that need to be dealt with in practice, and provided a scientific methodology for us to vigorously promote Chinese-style modernization.
To promote Chinese-style modernization in all fields, including economic, political, cultural, social, ecological and civilization, and in all aspects of relations between the party and the state, military and military, domestic and foreign affairs, and defense, we must make a systematic plan, but also dare to reform and innovate, and continuously achieve overall progress.
Top-level design requires a deep insight into the world's development trends, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the masses of people, a deep exploration of the laws of economic and social development, so that the planned and policy systems reflect the times, grasp the regularity, be creative, and achieve close integration, upward consistency and content coordination.
The promotion of Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory endeavor, and there are many unknown areas that need to be explored boldly in practice, and the development of the cause through reform and innovation should never be pursued with a heavy heart.
The strategic question is a fundamental question of a political party, of a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must strengthen the forward-looking nature of the strategy, foresee the future and lead the future with a scientific strategy; we must strengthen the holistic nature of the strategy, focus on solving the major problems of the party and state affairs, and move quickly to solve the major problems of the whole; we must strengthen the stability of the strategy, and once the strategy is formed, we must persist in the long term, grasp it to the end, and do good work.
To grasp the dialectical unified relationship of strategy and strategy scientifically, organically combine the principle of strategy and the flexibility of strategy, flexible maneuver, random stress, critical decision, grasp strategic initiative in the context of geographical convenience, momentum, and progress.
The Chinese nation is a nation of innovation.
To deal with the relationship between reform and innovation, we must not only preserve the essence and source of Chinese-style modernization, but also unwaveringly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, and put innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, comply with the development requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively recognize the changes and challenges, vigorously promote reform and innovation, constantly shape new development and innovative new strengths, and fully inspire the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is the important foundation of fairness, and fairness is the strong guarantee of efficiency.
We are advancing Chinese-style modernization, both to create greater efficiency than capitalism, and to more effectively maintain social equity, and better achieve efficiency and equity in harmony, mutually promoting and unifying.
To manage relations efficiently and fairly, to achieve development for the people, development by the people, and development results shared by the people, so that the benefits of modern construction are more equitable for all people.
To advance Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to deal with the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both vibrant and stable.
To integrate the two great issues of development and security, implement the overall national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the capacity to maintain national security, firmly maintain the security of the national regime, the security of institutions, ideological security and security in key areas.
Taking security factors into account in development, enhancing national security strength through development, using the achievements of development to strengthen the foundation of national security, and creating a security environment conducive to economic and social development, continuously stimulating development vitality, achieving high quality development and high level of security.
To advance Chinese-style modernization, we must not only follow our own path, but also expand our worldview, remain open to the outside world, and constantly expand the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must insist on independence, self-reliance, self-strengthening, insist on putting the development of the nation and the nation on the basis of our own strength, insist on holding the fate of our country's development and progress firmly in our own hands.
We must continue to expand our high-level opening to the outside world, participate in the division of labor and cooperation in global industry, use domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit.
The paths of the righteous lead to the place of safety.
Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and under the guidance of Xi Jinping's New Era Socialist Thought Science, grasp the rules, work hard, fully exercise our enthusiasm, initiative and creativity, properly handle a series of important relationships, and actively and continuously open up new frontiers of Chinese-style modernization in the new journey of building a comprehensive socialist modern state.
The Biden administration on Friday blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in the balloon spy program.
The US Commerce Department said the five Chinese companies and one research institute helped modernize the Chinese military, especially its aerospace programs, including its aircraft carriers and aircraft.
The blacklisted companies have a hard time getting their technology exported to the US.
The list is called the Entity List, and companies on it will not be able to buy technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The companies included in the blacklist are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., the 48th Institute of China Electronics and Technology Group, Dongguan Liangqiang Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Xiamen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Xiamen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Before that, the White House said it was considering broader measures to expose and deal with the larger scale of Chinese surveillance that threatens US national security.
The balloon incident has further heightened tensions between China and the United States, with US Secretary of State Blinken cancelling a planned visit to China.
The Chinese government has criticized the US for its heavy interference in the US embassy in China, which was hit by the US air strike on February 4, and for the damage it has caused to the efforts and processes of stabilizing China-US relations.
Based on the evidence of the wreckage and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the US government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon had a direct relationship with the People's Liberation Army of China and was a supplier approved by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained its position on the accidental entry of a Chinese unmanned aircraft into US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the Foreign Ministry website, she added that the relevant resolution of the US Congress is a pure political manipulation and a hoax.
The Chinese side strongly disagrees and strongly opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary for export enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce, said: "Today's actions demonstrate our collective efforts to identify and stop China's use of spy balloons that have violated U.S. and over 40 other countries' airspace".

Reuters reported that an employee of Tianhai Xiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. in Guangzhou said he was not aware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the US has not yet commented on the information.

The hope of finding survivors has been fading for days after the earthquake hit parts of Turkey and Syria, but the relief of the rescuers on Saturday was the rescue of five people.
The five-member family was rescued from the rubble in the town of Nurdai, in the heavily affected province of Gaziantep, after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days, according to the Associated Press.
Rescuers pulled the mother and daughter from the rubble and then found the father, but he insisted on saving his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, the crowd shouted for joy.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also rescued in the harsh cold weather.
What day is today?
The boy, who was trapped under the rubble for 129 hours, asked the rescuers to save him after he was brought back to the surface.

The miraculous rescue successes have given a new lease of life to the hopeful search and rescue effort, but at the same time, the number of victims is rising.
According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has already killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, while the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated at more than 3,500.
Although experts say that people can survive for up to a week after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly tenuous.
Rescuers are still using thermal imaging to look for signs of life under the rubble.
Meanwhile, the focus of the rescue effort has shifted to helping survivors who are in dire need of help.
UN official: The region is facing a 100-year-old disaster
Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, told a news conference in Turkey that the earthquake was the worst disaster to hit the region in a century.
He also praised Turkey's response to the disaster as exceptionally brave.
He also told Reuters reporters that he hoped to be able to provide relief to areas controlled by the Syrian government and opposition, but that the situation was unclear.
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief funds to help people in Syria's earthquake-hit areas.
Earlier this week, the United Nations announced $25 million for the disaster relief efforts in Turkey and Syria.

Google AI chatbot answers wrong questions, parent company shares evaporate by $100 billion
(Telegram from 11th)
Google's newly launched chatbot Bard was a disaster, with its short promotional video asking questions and answering them incorrectly, causing the stock price of Google's parent company Alphabet to plummet 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark, and evaporating $110 billion (RM476.5 billion) in value, down to $94.57 at the close of trading on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet will not be able to compete with its rival Microsoft.
Earlier this month, Google posted a short promotional video on social media for its AI chatbot Bard, in which a person asked Bard: "What new things can I tell my 9-year-old about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?"
In his answer, Joan Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first photographs of exoplanets.
However, according to NASA, the first image of an extrasolar planet was taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in 2004.
The company's stock price plunged after Bard's wrong answer, according to a Reuters report.
Google, on the other hand, notes that Bard's response kit highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process that combines external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response kit meets high standards based on quality, safety and authentic information.
Singapore tourism recovery strong, inbound travelers up 19x from 2021
The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that 12 to 14 million international visitors are expected to visit Singapore in 2023, bringing about 18 to 21 billion yuan in tourism revenue; visitor numbers and tourism revenue will return to about 67 to 75 percent of pre-coronavirus levels in 2019; and there is a strong possibility of a full recovery in the tourism industry in 2024.
Singapore Tourism Market to be restarted and revived in 2022
The latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that inbound visitors in 2022 will increase 19-fold from 33.06 million in 2021 to 6.3 million, exceeding the previous estimate of 4 to 6 million, and returning to 33 percent of pre-pandemic levels.
Singapore's tourism revenue totaled S$8.96 billion in January-September 2022, and is expected to reach S$13.8 billion to S$14.3 billion in full-year 2022, up six to seven times from S$1.89 billion in 2021, and has recovered to levels of about 50 to 52 percent of pre-coronavirus levels in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken several steps to speed up the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced nearly S$500 million to stimulate the tourism industry's recovery.
The Tourism Board recently announced that it plans to allocate 110 million yuan from the budget over the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract returning tourists.
In order to make wellness one of the tourist highlights in Singapore, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has released a call for tenders on 23 November 2022 for the development of a wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, Executive Director of Sport and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have put their health first in their considerations.
The development of a health and wellness destination in the southern part of the city, with the Bay of Bengal Gardens and the Bay of Bengal Dams, is expected to contribute to the tourism industry and the economy of Singapore, allowing visitors to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
Singapore Tourism Board Director Chen Jianlong said that in the coming years, health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism product.
The coronavirus pandemic has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Department has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, Singapore Tourism Board hosted the first Healthy Living Festival, offering more than 130 different health activities and experiences to the public.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences to its visitors.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, the Avatar World at the Pearl Bay Gardens, the Central Beach Market in Santa Taobao, the Art and Science Museum's newly added Gallery of Exploring New Areas of Art, and the newly built open-air theatre at the Night Wildlife Park, the Tourism Bureau will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Bird Park in the World of All-Wildlife, making Singapore an attractive international destination.
As planned, Singapore will develop industry standards for sustainable tourism related to conferences, meetings and awards by 2023, with a focus on improving both waste management and carbon emissions, further optimizing the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of its aviation industry.
As of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Changi Airport has recovered strongly, with up to 150,000 passengers received daily and about 1 million per week, equivalent to about 75% of the pre-coronavirus level, and the number of airline employees has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-coronavirus level.
Data shows that Singapore has received 23.6 million passengers from January to October 2022, which is 42% of pre-coronavirus levels, and 170,000 flights, which is 53% of pre-coronavirus levels.
The rapid recovery in tourism has also spurred the recovery of other sectors such as accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping.
Singapore's government and tourism industry are very optimistic about the Chinese market.
According to a survey conducted by the China Travel Platform, Singapore's safety index is among the top three in the world, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is popular with Chinese tourists, said Mr. Kowthang, Assistant Director of the Singapore Tourism Board's International Division.
Before the coronavirus pandemic, about 3.6 million Chinese tourists visited Singapore every year.
With China's relaxed border policy, it is expected that Chinese tourists will return to the country this year and reach 30 to 60 percent in 2019.
Ko said that the tourism agency will be watching closely for further signals from China regarding its policy on outbound travel to respond to changing tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening its partnership with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare for the new trends in Chinese overseas travel and welcome Chinese tourists.
Looking ahead to the 2023 tourism market, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that the recovery of the tourism industry will be faster than expected, as long as there is no significant recession in the global economy that affects public revenues, and no new large-scale deadly outbreaks.
Kim Jong-un's father and daughter interact intimately, wife is left behind
North Korea held a military parade on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the country on the evening of August 8, with leader Kim Jong-un's daughter Kim Hye-jae not only attending but also standing on the podium with her father.
Kim Jong-un is seen standing next to her father, making several warm glances and gestures, holding his cheeks with her hands and even touching his chest, and the interactive images of the father and daughter are broadcast to the whole country.
However, the First Lady, Lee Hsien Loong, was forced to step aside.
In the official photo of Kim Jong-un and Lee Hye-seok attending the dinner with their daughter Kim Hye-jae on July 7, Kim Hye-jae is not only seen sitting in the middle of the table in the middle of the table, but also on the stage with Kim Jong-un at the parade for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Korea on the following night.
The official media released a video of the parade on North Korean Central Television, which showed more intimate scenes of the father and daughter.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium, and the smiles never left their faces, and they talked in their ears, Kim Jong-un once held his father's arms with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a laugh.
Other official media images also showed Kim and Kim Jong Un sitting on a sofa chair in the living room, touching their hands on their father's face; and Kim and her father walking hand in hand, touching Kim Jong Un's chest.
The first lady, Lee Hsien Loong, was only allowed to walk in the back or sit on the side, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
Kim Jong-il has been making public appearances for three months now, and this is the fifth time he has appeared in public since he first publicly appeared on November 18th, when he tested the Mars 17 rocket.
The official Korean media used the titles "Dearest Son" and "Dearest Son" to refer to Kim Jong-il, and also broadcast footage of him repeatedly shouting his oath to defend the white race while watching the parade from the podium.
The signs have raised doubts about whether Kim Jong-il has been cast as the heir apparent to the Kim dynasty, with the Washington Post analyzing the move as a signal for Kim to put his middle-school-aged daughter in the position of successor, though there are those who argue that such a judgment is premature and that there are still possibilities in the case of Kim having a son on his knees.
Chong Yang asked Qiao Qiao how he viewed the January non-farm employment data in the US, the big over-expectations and future trends - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News Website
Q: How do you see the January non-farm employment data in the US exceeding expectations and future trends?
A: January 3, 2023 nonfarm employment data released by the U.S. Department of Labor, adding 517,000 nonfarm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wage growth was 4.4%, year-over-year growth was 0.3%, slightly slower.
In total, there are many one-time and technical factors that have disrupted the data, such as teachers who are on strike, the revision of the survey caliber, the update of the seasonality factor, which may be corrected later (refer to the new non-agricultural increase in January 2022 from 504,000 to 364,000), and non-agricultural employment may not be as strong as the data shows.
Structurally, the impact of high-tech firms' layoffs remains, but is low; new jobs in high-touch services such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have recovered significantly, and data shows that the service sector's labor force gap remains.
Combined with the equally over-expected service PMI, the rebound in job vacancies and the labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector is in a fast recovery after the extreme weather and the holidays.
We believe that the supply and demand tensions in the US job market will not improve without a recession.
The U.S. labor market is still short of more than 5 million workers, and labor participation is slowly increasing, especially among those aged 25-54 who are nearing their pre-pandemic highs.
In addition, strong consumer demand, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit of US residents, will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the labor market.
The continued tension in the US labor market will be the underlying cause of the US economy in 2023.
The overlap is now coming to an end, inflation expectations are recurring, and we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Prior to the data, the US equity and debt markets were overly optimistic about the Fed's path to raising interest rates.
With the continuing improvement in inflation data, the Fed is slowing down the pace of rate hikes and maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market is blind to the Fed's biased narratives, not only expecting an early end to the rate hike, but also expecting two rate cuts by the end of the year.
In a situation of tight supply and demand in the labor market and uncertain impact of austerity policy, we believe that the guidance of the US Federal Reserve for raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the extreme adjustment and crowding of transactions expected in the market will cause some damage to the market.
However, the persistence of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapidly declining inflation, with the M2 data year-on-year overload and the gradual improvement of the leading indicators of various CPI sub-indices, since October, the US CPI data has moved into a phase of rapid decline, the persistence of wage growth will only form the basis for future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, after the next inflation data is released, the market will enter a new round of games.
The founder of Suzuki, Yang Yonggang, died of a sudden heart attack after leading the first transformation of Chinese clothing - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News Website
On February 11, the certification body issued a public notice to WeChat public number of Sugiyama Holding Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Sugiyama Holding Co., Ltd.) that the founder of Sugiyama Enterprises, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sugiyama Holding Co., Ltd., Yang Yongkang, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to sudden cardiac arrest.
In the 1980s, Yang was the head of the state-owned cotton mill, and in 1989 he became the head of the Ningbo Yun Port General Clothing Factory, the predecessor of the Sugyu Group.
In December 2022, during the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Future Star of Chinese Enterprises, Yang Yonggang said that in the 1990s, the market share of the Sugu brand in the Chinese western clothing market was as high as 37%.
In 1996, Sugihisawa became the first company in the Chinese clothing industry to list its shares on the stock exchange.
Just as the clothing business was booming, the Sugiyashi Group began to transform, because Yang Yonggang realized that once the market opened, Chinese brands would naturally form a tiered brand market, and Sugiyashi clothing wanted to be the only one to dominate the hype, and it was unlikely to become the national clothing of the country for a long time.
In 1999, Sugisugi started to study corporate transformation, and Yang Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what transformation really does, and we specifically sought out many expert scholars, and we held a series of discussions and workshops".
Finally, we have set two major strategic directions:
The first is new energy and new materials, the other is a healthy future.
After the strategic direction was determined, Sugiyama began to look for cooperation. At that time, the Carbon Institute of the Busan Institute of Thermal Energy was doing the national 863 project for the aluminum steel, and the scientific funding was not enough.
In 2001, Sugiyama achieved the large-scale production of intermediate-phase carbon microbubbles, and began to domesticise alternatives, replacing Japan as the main supplier of intermediate-phase carbon microbubbles in the country.
It is the first lithium-ion battery negative material production company in China, and has achieved the domestic production of lithium-ion battery negative material.
With the rapid popularity of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Sugiyama began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium-ion materials business was written into the main business of Sugiyama, and the revenue share of the clothing business decreased year by year, until 2013, the revenue of the lithium-ion materials business of Sugiyama was fully exceeded by the clothing business.
In February 2021, Sugimoto successfully merged with LG Chemical's polarized film business, entering the LCD polarized film market, and founded the polarized film company Sugimoto Electric, which has a high technical content in this field. Sugimoto's main competitors are the world's top 500 companies, such as Samsung of Korea, Sumitomo Chemical of Japan, and JD Electric.
Yang Yonggang shared his thoughts on post-investment management, saying that Chinese private companies have a low probability of success in acquiring some of the world's top high-tech companies, so why do they fail?
But it's different with Yang Yonggang, because the day that the acquisition was successful, Yang Yonggang went to Seagate and announced to the public that Seagate, as the major shareholder of Seagate, had decided to implement the one-two system, except for Yang Yonggang as chairman, the people of Seagate's enterprise were not sent to Seagate, and the authorized way of operating, the original distribution system, corporate culture, and management models were unchanged.
ICC's Negative Polarity data for 2022 shows that the Negative Polarity of the Sage Seed has exceeded 200,000 tons in shipments in 2022, a 100% year-on-year increase, and a market share of 16%, ranking first in the shipment of artificial graphite negative materials.
In the segment of the optical film business, Yano Research's statistics show that the company's Seikichi Optical Electric has a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to be the world's number one.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Sugiyama's revenue was 15.84 billion yuan, net profit was 2.13 billion yuan, and on February 10, Sugiyama's share price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market capitalization of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Sugihisa, a subsidiary of Sugihisa, said on its interactive platform that the company's effective graphite production capacity is about 100,000 tons by the end of 2022, and that the graphite production capacity of the Mines project is still in the ascending phase.
The company's CEO, Yang Yonggang, is still the chairman and de facto controller of the company.
The survey shows that Yang Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total shares of Sugiyama Holding Co., Ltd.
The general manager of the company is Li Zhihua, born in 1968, formerly of Dongguan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., and Hunan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and vice general manager of Ningbo Battery Materials Co., Ltd.
On February 10, Sugiyama's investors' interactive platform said that the company's senior management is not related to the company's actual controllers.
E-account of the Hedge Fund: SEC authorizes development of all funds under the name of investors to achieve aggregation and query - Economic Watch Network - Professional Financial News Website
The complexity of the fund's purchase channels has made it difficult to gather account information.
Always forgetting about the little treasure chest?
The problems of the KiM people will be solved soon.
On February 10, the SEC announced that the E-account app for the Liquidity Fund was available in mobile app stores and was in public trial operation.
The E-account of the fund provides individual investors with one-stop-shop information on the account and shares of the fund, which is aimed at solving the pain points of the industry such as the forgotten accounts of large and small investors, and the burdensome queries.
According to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there were 156 ETF managers in the country, managing funds of about 26 trillion yuan; 167 ETF share registration agencies, and 411 ETF sales agencies.
The accounting systems of the quota registries are independent of each other and lack a unified channel for inquiries.
According to industry sources, at the end of 2021, more than 720 million people in China, or half of the country, invested in fund products.
Previously, investors had to check their purchases through different sales agencies, but through the E account of the hedge fund, they could check all sales channels for purchases, and the funds were held in one place.
What is the E-account app?
According to the documents, the E-Account App is a Chinese-developed and approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to provide investors with a one-stop query of the off-site holdings of shares in the entire market of E-Funds products.
Investors can easily and quickly access their ownership of the OTC shares of the fund managers' OTC products purchased through the various sales channels in the market through the OTC E account, which improves the overall efficiency of queries.
Specifically, the information that investors can access through the E-account window of the E-fund includes: information about fund accounts opened with various E-fund managers in the market, information about trading accounts opened with E-fund sales agencies, and information about the number of investors holding off-site shares in products such as the open-ended securities investment fund and the collective asset management plan established by the management of the securities company, which is not limited to 200 people.
The Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center Business Manager Liu Yiqi told Economic Observer that investors can learn all their OTC fund holdings through the OTC fund E account app, which helps them find forgotten asset classes, and more importantly, the full account information of the integrated fund investment situation has been compiled for customers, helping customers to better optimize their fund portfolio configuration and better plan their financial arrangements.
How to register?
The report notes that the E-account app is available in mobile app stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo, etc. The app is still in the open trial phase, and the invitation code is required to register. Investors can contact the fund manager of the fund they hold to obtain it.
A customer service representative of a large Shanghai-based public-private fund gave a six-digit invitation to the Economic Watch Network reporter and told the reporter that during the trial phase of the ZAPP, China will give a certain number of invitations to each fund manager, and we will provide them to investors who call.
After the trial run, the invitation code will no longer be used for open user registration.
The Crab
The account registration and enquiry process took only a few minutes, and was divided into four main steps: user registration, real name verification, fund account binding, and public fund enquiry.
After this step, the journalists can see all the fund products purchased through the various fund sales platforms in the list of binding options ((Bind accounts), after completing the binding, they can see the total assets of the invested fund and can start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the E-account window of the Hedge Fund only provides an inquiry service for investors and does not allow for redemption.
The data date shown in the E account window of the hedge fund is generally three trading days forward of the date of the user's query (T-day).
For example, if the E account of a hedge fund is opened on February 10, the total assets, fund shares, and net worth of the fund shown on the asset page are moved forward three trading days from that date, i.e., February 7.

US-Fiji defense consensus against China
On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the Chinese Communist Party's aggression in the South and East Seas, and the Philippine leaders issued a joint statement after the meeting saying that they would sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States to have substantive defense exchanges and oppose the Chinese Communist Party's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishimoto hopes that the meeting will help the two countries to formulate policies to address the crisis in Taipei.
Marcos Jr. visited China in early January and won a $20 billion deal.
But after that, the relationship between China and the Philippines not only did not improve, but deteriorated.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to the US military to ensure the security of the South China Sea.
One of the new additions is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan, and is the closest to China.
If Taiwan is in crisis, US troops may be deployed to bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media have suggested that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines are now forming an axis with the US to build a "Arc of Tension" in the Western Pacific to confront the CCP in order to promote regional cooperation.
National Party Vice Chairman Shelly Wang says in a speech: "We welcome the Green Camp visit to the country on the basis of the consensus of 9/2".
Vice Chairman of the Taiwanese People's National Party, Shi Lian, will meet with the Director of the State Council of China, Liu Bei, and the Permanent Secretary of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Wang Yi-ning.
Senior adviser of the Nationalist Party's official state policy foundation, Liu Chun-shan, was interviewed by the Taiwan Central News Agency last night and gave a positive assessment of Liu's comments to Xi, saying that China welcomes green camp members to visit the mainland as long as they agree with the 9-2 consensus and oppose Taiwan independence.
The Nationalist Party's assessment of the situation is new.
The news of the day did not mention this as Sharik had said earlier that he had met with Liu.
The ruling Taiwanese Democratic Party (PDP) has clarified its refusal to accept the '92 Consensus'
According to the official Xinhua news agency, the Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang Party, Mr. Shao Yi, met with the CCP Central Political Bureau's Standing Committee Chairman, Mr. Wang Yining, the new State Bureau Director, Mr. Liu Yi, and the Beijing Municipal Committee Secretary, Mr. Liu Yi.
In an interview with Liu, Shui Li said that the political basis of the Nationalist Party is the Ninth Conciliation and anti-Taiwan independence, while Liu Chunsan, a senior advisor to the Nationalist Party Foundation, said that the Ninth Conciliation of the Nationalist Party is the original Ninth Conciliation.
This is different from the previous meetings I attended.
Recent video conferences with mainland academics, and this one, did not hear Taiwanese scholars talk about the military unification and anti-secession, but instead about the resumption of exchanges and dialogue.
The Chinese mainland hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang, which is the main party in the country.
The Chinese government has not yet decided whether to allow the Taiwanese to stay in the country, and the Chinese government has not yet decided whether to allow the Taiwanese to stay in the country.
According to Yang Chun-shan, Wang Yi-ning personally instructed Yang to tell him about the demands of the Taiwanese farmers and fishermen, saying that you must implement the demands, and if you cannot solve them all, you must take individual cases.
The report did not mention whether the KMT visitor to the mainland had personally mentioned the daily disturbances of Chinese warships, the issue of farming and fishing in Taiwan's minority counties, or whether the interview with the CEN reporter had asked such questions.
Law union again mobilizes against government pension reform
On Saturday (11 February), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of the social movement against the draft pension reform of the government.
The number of people who respond to the call for a rally could influence the next action plan of the trade union movement.
This is the fourth time in a month that the eight largest French trade union groups have joined forces to launch a nationwide mobilization, and the first time that the protest has been scheduled for a Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people, and they don't have to choose between protesting or striking, the union group hopes that today's rally will attract more people.
The bus system, the metro and the public railway company unions did not call for a strike today, the bus system should be functioning normally, citizens can travel by car to the rally site, and in areas where schools have started the winter holidays, people can start their holidays normally.
The union group expects more than a million people to attend the rally today, while the police expect a national turnout of between 600,000 and 800,000, and in the Paris metropolitan area between 90,000 and 120,000.
Since the start of the anti-government pension reform protests, while polls show that most French people do not support the move to raise the legal retirement age from 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to protest has been decreasing.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people nationwide.
The demonstration on Tuesday (7 February) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
The pension reform is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition, especially the radical left-led opposition, has submitted so many amendments that the process of consideration has been very slow.
The conflict between the North and the South is also becoming more intense.
A member of the radical left-wing party France Sans Confiance (FNC) has sparked protests in the ruling party after posting on social media a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the head of the labour minister.
The Speaker of the National Assembly finally announced that the MP was banned from parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for this act.
Although the reforms have sparked the biggest social upheaval in France in more than 20 years, the government has so far made no major concessions, albeit slightly modified, to the draft.
The union is already preparing to launch another action on Thursday, March 16, and will also be organizing demonstrations on March 7 when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion.
China encourages high fertility rates to be transferred to universities
The Human Sperm Bank in Yunnan Province, China, launched a campaign on 9th to solicit donations from university graduates or students, and successful donations of 8 to 12 times will receive a subsidy of 4500 yuan.
The message was quickly followed by a search on Weibo, according to Taipei Media today, and prompted initiatives in cities across Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to a report by the Free Times, China encourages university students to donate sperm.
The highest threshold for sperm donation is set by the Beijing University of Applied Sciences, which requires a height of 170 cm or more, five-leggedness, no obvious hair loss, and a near-sightedness of 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province said that sperm donors can get a full set of male health tests worth 1,000 yuan, especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never done, and is important to know their fertility status.
The conditions for donating sperm include: height of 165 cm or more, university degree or higher, color blindness, genetic diseases such as hepatitis B and infectious diseases.
The report quoted Chinese news outlet TCM as saying that the Human Sperm Bank in Shaanxi Province had printed a poster for the "Infinite Glory" campaign, which calls on young people to donate sperm and encourages netizens to send messages to the public, "Let love pass on".
The price of sperm in Shanxi province is higher than in Yunnan, and the qualified person can receive 300 yuan in cash each time, and the donor who completes a certain number of donations can receive a subsidy of 5000 yuan.
The highest known price tag is Beijing, with the highest subsidy of 5150 yuan.
The last Communist Chancellor of East Germany died today.
The successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that Hans Modrow passed away last night at the age of 95.
As a result, our party lost an important leader.
The Crab
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Moderator said he would help transform East Germany into a democratic state.
The Communist Party leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modrow declared the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results have made him no longer the Prime Minister.
Despite Modro's reforms, opponents accuse him of trying to delay the political change and unification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reform rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modro was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but was not jailed.
The accusations are politically motivated.
Modrow continued to serve in the German parliament from 1990 to 1994, and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modro sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return, but that East Germany's achievements should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II he served as a youth fire brigade commander and became a member of the Volkssturm, a Nazi militia organization that recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 to participate in the final struggle of the war, near the end of the conflict.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he took anti-fascist courses and became a committed Communist Party member.
In 1949, the year of the founding of East Germany, he returned to his homeland and found a job as a mechanic, and continued his studies in social sciences and economics, obtaining a doctorate.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth movement, which almost all East German youth joined, and was promoted through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) to chairman of the Dresden regional party from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Hackers supporting protests on Iran's revolutionary anniversary hijack presidential TV speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted a televised speech by President Ibrahim Raisi.
The president's live televised speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, when a logo of a group of anti-government hackers, named Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)  appeared on the screen.
A voice shouted "Death to the Islamic Republic!"
The state TV was hacked to interrupt the commemoration of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Reuters reported today.
The hardline government of Raisi faces its biggest challenge yet from young protesters who demanded their ouster, but Raisi still calls on the deceived youth to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
The nationwide protests have continued in Iran after the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in custody of the country's Moral Police in September.
The deadly crackdown by Iranian security forces on the protests is one of the most powerful challenges facing the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution toppled the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
As part of the amnesty marking the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissidents Fahad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha, who were on hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty order that included some of the prisoners arrested during the recent anti-government protests.
As of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors, according to HRANA, a human rights organization.
The report said that 70 other government security personnel were killed.
The number of protesters arrested is believed to be as high as 19,763.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for votes in Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On the eve of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution on Friday night, the official media showed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebrations, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)
However, many could be heard in the rally shouting "Death to the dictator!"
The death of the Islamic Republic in a video posted on Twitter and social media.
On Saturday, state TV broadcast live video of official rallies in various states across the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, the country's anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed.
President Lacey's speeches are often interrupted by the slogan "America go to hell", a signature slogan at state conventions.
The crowd shouted, "Away with Israel!"
Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months, Reuters said.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 for national security charges.
They later put her under house arrest, but in January she was back in prison.
Adelkhah denies the allegations.
A week before his release, supporters warned that he was at risk of death for his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of the hijab.
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday by calling for her freedom to be restored, including allowing her to return to France if she wishes.

The balloon incident has brightened America's eyes?
Restrictions on technology exports to China
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the US is preparing to tighten its export of technology to China further after the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and would seek more political support for enhanced U.S. technology protection.
The United States says the balloon carries antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now works at the Washington think tank Center for a New American Security.
This is definitely adding fuel to the fire and supporting the hardliners' view of China.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that the White House will also consider taking broader action to expose and respond to China's broader surveillance activities that pose a threat to our national security and those of our allies and partners.
The US officials said that they had informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident and that international coordination was crucial to respond to the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly formed U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party could also pressure the United States to take more drastic measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which could force the White House to take a tougher line.
The Wall Street Journal reports that many advocates of stricter export controls are also pushing for expanded regulations to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government is also developing a Foreign Investment Review Program to examine US investments abroad for potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls for a faster rollout of the program.
Syria earthquake relief day after day
Since the powerful earthquake in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night in the rubble of thousands of buildings that were destroyed by the quake, rescuing survivors buried under the rubble.
In the freezing temperatures, they often appeal to silence, as they struggle to hear any sound of life from the rotting concrete piles.
Two more women were rescued from the rubble after surviving the earthquake for several days, according to a Reuters report today.
However, the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 24,150 people.
The death toll in Turkey stands at 20,665, while the death toll in Syria is over 3,500.
The 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Monday, which was followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the nearly 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Rescuers in Turkey have rescued two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings after they were trapped for 122 hours in the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, Turkish authorities said Saturday.
Another wounded man, identified as Masallah Cicek, 55, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the freezing temperatures, rescuers often appealed for silence as they struggled to hear any sound of life from the crumbling concrete piles.
In Turkey's Samandag district, rescuers huddled under concrete slabs whispering "Inshallah" to God's blessing, carefully reaching into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old baby.
He opened his eyes and saw the infant Yagiz Ulas wrapped in a blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video footage shows the paramedics also taking his mother, who is lying on a stretcher, looking pale, but conscious.
Fuat Oktay, Turkey's vice president, told reporters late at night that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and 31,000 rescuers had been deployed in the affected areas.
He said that about 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people were left homeless by the earthquake and were crowded into temporary shelters.
As many people are short of food in the cold winter conditions, there is growing public skepticism about the response of the leaders of the two countries to the disaster.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited a hospital in Aleppo, according to Syrian state media, in what was reported to be his first visit to the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said its stockpiles in rebel-held northwestern Syria were running out as the war complicated relief efforts.
On Friday, Erdogan visited the Turkish province of Adana, where he acknowledged that the government's response was not as fast as expected.
Opponents took this issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in the May 14 vote, but may be delayed by the disaster.
Anger over delays in providing aid and rescue could affect the election, Reuters said.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdogan's two decades of rule.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called the negative campaign of the Kurds for political gain.
The main opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu criticized the government's reaction.
The critics say that the earthquake was big, but worse than the earthquake was the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence.

The University of Brunei is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, ranking third in the region.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of Vietnam's cooperation with Brunei in education and training.
The University of Brunei officially established a partnership with FPT University in July 2013, with the main area of cooperation being English language training.
In addition to English, French, German, Japanese and Korean, Vietnamese is also taught in the curriculum at Brno University.
During a visit to Brunei University, Prime Minister Van Minh Duong and Ms. Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan held a conversation with students in the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Van Minh is pleased that more and more foreigners are learning Vietnamese, and thus making a positive contribution to promoting Vietnamese cultural identity and identity around the world.
Prime Minister Van Minh Tri expressed his hope and belief that the Vietnamese language teaching staff at Brunei University will be stronger and stronger; Vietnamese students will be more interested in Vietnamese, will study hard, will be able to speak Vietnamese fluently and will become ambassadors of the friendly cooperation between the two countries.
Prime Minister Van Minh also took the opportunity to interact with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Centre in Ha Noi, via video, to learn about their learning, especially during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Van Minh Tri believes that the partnership between FPT University and Brunei University, especially the FPT-UBD Global Centre, is a living symbol of the Vietnamese-Brunisian educational partnership.
The students of the center also hope to make greater progress in their studies and contribute positively to the friendly cooperation between Vietnam and Vietnamese-speaking countries.
During his meeting with the Minister of Education and the leadership of Brunei University, Prime Minister Van Minh Thích praised the progress made in educational cooperation between the two countries, including the cooperation between FPT University and Brunei University, and the initiative of Brunei University to include Vietnamese in the curriculum.
Prime Minister Van Minh Dung hopes that Brunei University will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the size of Vietnamese language classes.
Prime Minister Van Minh also praised the positive results of the cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding on Education Cooperation signed in April 2014 and recommended that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme, the Discovery Year and others.
Prime Minister Van Minh highly appreciated the establishment of the first branch of Brunei University in Vietnam in Southeast Asia; believes that the university is growing stronger in the region and the world; further expanding cooperation with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
The Prime Minister and his wife planted a tree in the Brunei campus and left a message in the memorial book.
Prime Minister Van Minh expressed his wishes for the University of Brunei to continue to develop and contribute more and more to the cause of education in Brunei, and to deepen and broaden cooperation with educational and training institutions in Vietnam.

The Vietnamese government has been criticized for its actions.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Van Minh and his wife made a successful official visit to Singapore and Brunei, with comprehensive, practical and concrete results, Vietnam News Agency's Hanoi correspondent Liu Yi said.
During his three-day visit to Singapore and Brunei, Prime Minister Van der Mei participated in more than 30 different events.
The achievements have provided new impetus to the development of the Vietnam-Vietnam Strategic Partnership and the Vietnam-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership in a deeper, broader and more effective direction.
During his visit to the two countries, Prime Minister Van Minh continued to reaffirm the foreign policy of the Vietnamese Party and the country, namely independence, autonomy, pluralism, change, willingness to be a good friend and reliable partner of all countries, and a responsible member of the international community.
Strengthening relations with Singapore and Brunei is a requirement of their respective countries, committed to enhancing the well-being of their respective peoples, and committed to peace, stability and development in the region and the world.
At the meetings and talks, Prime Minister Van Diem and the leaders of Singapore and Brunei agreed to enhance political mutual trust with Vietnam through visits by high-level delegations, effective implementation of bilateral cooperation mechanisms and important cooperation agreements.
A number of cooperation documents were signed during the visit.
Among them, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Green and Digital Economy Partnership with Singapore and the Action Plan on Strengthening the Vietnamese Comprehensive Partnership for the Period 2023-2027 with Brunei are two highlights.
Vietnam and Singapore sign Memorandum of Understanding on Partnership in Green and Digital Economy
The article was published by the Associated Press.
During meetings with business leaders, seminars or economic forums, Prime Minister Van Minh emphasized that Vietnam welcomes and facilitates the expansion of investment in Vietnam by Singaporean and Bruneiese companies in areas such as digital transformation, green energy, high technology and innovation.
The visit will not only help to deepen the cooperation between Vietnam and Singapore and Brunei in the traditional fields of politics, diplomacy, economy, security, defence, education and training, oil and gas, tourism and people-to-people exchanges, but also create a framework for cooperation in new potential areas such as the digital economy, green economy, energy transition, innovation, smart cities and sustainable development.
The King of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, is set to enter into a bilateral dialogue with Prime Minister Van Minnen.
The article was published by the Associated Press.
During his visit to the two countries, Prime Minister Van Minh also took the time to visit and listen to the thoughts and wishes of the local Vietnamese community.
During the meeting, Prime Minister Van Minh suggested that the two countries pay more attention to the local Vietnamese community, and create conditions for them to be treated fairly, to have opportunities to contribute to the local community and to foster relations between the two countries.
The proposal was agreed and supported by the leaders of both countries.
In particular, Prime Minister Van Diem shared with the leaders of the two countries their aspirations for a community of ASEAN united, peaceful, stable and prosperous, and agreed to maintain solidarity and collaboration with ASEAN countries and enhance ASEAN's central role in the complex and changing context of regional and international situations.
With the important achievements, Prime Minister Van Minh's official visit to Singapore and Brunei will contribute to the effective implementation of the 13th National Congress' priority foreign policy of strengthening relations with ASEAN neighbors, the effective implementation of the 12th Conclusion of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam on the New Situation of Vietnam (CLV-12/TW), and the exercise of the power of national unity.

What exactly is the plutonium object that was dropped over Alaska?
They are lost in their own vain imaginations.
The US military used its most advanced stealth fighter aircraft, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, USA, on Friday afternoon.
The site of the crash is ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an object in the air.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China was shot down over the coast of South Carolina, USA, days after it drifted in US airspace.
The second object shot down, which first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, at an altitude of 12,000 meters (~40,000 feet), the size of a small car, and much smaller than the Chinese balloon that was shot down earlier, the Pentagon said.
The Pentagon also believes that there is no indication that the object is manoeuvrable.
John Coby, the White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator, said Friday that while the exact nature of the high-flying object is unclear, it poses a legitimate threat to the safety of civil aviation aircraft.
The object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, had no hanging cargo pod, Coby said.
"We call it a 'cyan object' - that's the best description we can come up with right now", says Kobe.
President Biden consulted with the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he was very cautious in making that decision, Coby added.
The official US description of the object is roughly as follows: the size of a small car, no rudder, no suspension, flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But the information does not answer basic questions such as what the object is, what country it belongs to, what it is doing.
Many of the current online analyses and speculations suggest that it could be another Chinese balloon.
It could be that the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that hovered over Latin America were both from China, performing some kind of mission in different places.
The Alaska UFO is also associated with the UFO phenomenon.
The US Newsweek article quoted former US Representative Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday that he hoped the UFO was a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO.
The irony of conflating alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it is not worth the risk of an interstellar conflict, says Boommerge.
The tweet was posted by Majors shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object had been shot down in Alaska.
Newsweek said that more than one person suspected the object was a UFO.
Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, criticized the government's cover-up last month, asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on missing UFOs.
Amazon's customer service is unbelievable
I guess few people have seen it, but I'll say a little bit about it.
The dress we bought was a hoodie, and the last thing I got was a pair of shorts.
I immediately contacted Amazon customer service after receiving the clothes, and they confirmed that the clothes were still in stock, I asked for a replacement, the customer said to solve it, and then immediately saw the name of the product turned into a short sleeve, the link I had bought was off the shelf.
The customer service will then either withhold the goods for a certain amount of compensation or return them.
This is how Amazon handles it?
It's hard to believe that the clothing itself is not my problem, that I as a consumer demanded to get the goods I should have, and didn't make any exaggerated demands, and Amazon changed its name and said it had no stock.
This is my first long comment, and hopefully not my last.
The Sleeve That Made It Unintelligible
The sleeves of the jacket are longer than the shirt, but usually only 1-2 cm. The sleeves of the jacket are longer than the shirt, but usually only 1-2 cm. The sleeves of the jacket are longer than the shirt, but the sleeves of the jacket are longer than the shirt.
It's easy to buy clothes, and easy to return them.
But when will the money be returned?
The clothes are good, because the prints are small, and they have to be returned, but it's been more than a week since the return, and I still haven't received my refund?
And to have to buy from the same company that didn't have the same integrity, and that was the worst thing since buying from Amazon!
But the store is still good, actively cooperating to promote express delivery and timely refunds, but this full-peak express delivery is actually doing a rather irritating job, delaying about half a month to refund, this partner is to drag the back legs of Amazon, poor work efficiency, no service awareness!
More for the Young
99 seconds to kill.
The fur is well made, colored and handled, soft/thin to medium, and does not smell like kerosene.
Unfortunately, the model is a slim one, more suitable for younger people.
3XL, flat waist 2 ft 5 in, maximum size 4 ft, 1.79/80 kg, wears a little tight at the waist.
It seems that there is no loose belt at the waist, and it is difficult to loosen the waist.
And it's uncomfortable to wear it.
Very good. The colors are not very bright.
I just bought it for 200 and this is what happened.
The first time Amazon used the collaboration of the daily messenger, the first delivery was not at home, then the initiative and the courier agreed on two delivery times, the courier did not deliver, then directly returned the package to me, the damned courier did not have any integrity, strongly recommend not to use the daily messenger again.
This time, I got a shirt back, and the price of the shirt went up by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon shouldn't have this kind of product
The price is not low, and the reviews are also very good.
I was stunned when I received the product, the surface of the product was worn out, there was worn out in many other places, not the secondary product is the old product, later on the picture.
I asked for a refund, and the manufacturer said it was because of the shipping, after seeing the pictures, isn't that a big deal?
How can the inside of a product wear out?
There are only two possibilities, either I used the product or I intentionally damaged the product and returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence that I have not damaged the goods, but based on my credit history of Amazon purchases, I think that such goods should not appear in Amazon self-made goods, customers choose Amazon self-made is trust, customer win, we win, customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory, hope that we all work together to improve, thank you.
I've been using this product for less than a year and I've got two E2s, I don't know how to handle them?
I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the red E2 was often seen in the two sets on the right side of the receiver, should be a problem with the launch module, which is not compatible with the launch module's 7 years of sustainable work on the Amazon website, and after not being able to find it on the Amazon website, now I don't know how good it is?
I'll take it.
The first purchase is bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the machine was broken.
And it's always a blank canvas.
I'll change it later.
The changeover was quick, the view was a bit blurry at night, not very wide, but it was enough for the average household.
It's not enough to have no card, buy it yourself, or buy a phone from Amazon before.
The packaging has a sticker to prevent the package from being opened, but this time there is no sticker, and when you buy a mobile phone, there is a sticker that can be attached to the warranty card, but this time there is no such thing.
I don't know if it's something cheap or not, I'm confused.
Waiting for a response from the supplier
The packaging is not marked, I called the supplier directly and said that the unmarked package is genuine, I was wondering if I could send the product to J&J by mail, I left the license plate number and phone number, I promised to send a text message to inform me that I had entered my information into the J&J warranty card, and I haven't received a text message yet?
The oil was received in the morning and changed in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's own products are safe.
The teacher who changed the oil said that the oil was clean and really good.
I bought it for the second time.
So it's a relief.
The delivery was fast, the packaging was not picky, the oil was used, the engine noise was significantly reduced.
The price is good, and it is difficult to find synthetic oil below 200.
The winner is the one who has the most points, the winner is the one who has the most points, and the winner is the one who has the most points.
Amazon Japan suffered a loss of profit due to customer service issues ((8c's caterpillar shipped as 8cm's caterpillar)) ((8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admitted error, but always recommended, always emphasized that the goods are third party, not binding on third parties.
The order number is 503-4265464-1830254.
I bought the page size options 7c, 8, 9c, I thought it was a trap, I called the customer service in China and told them 8c was 8c, but when I returned to China I found that it was only 8cm, I thought it was a trap set to trap the Chinese people (according to Amazon), now I look at the page and there is no such option.
Chinese customer service: Sorry for the loss, we have two options for you:
1, You return the item, the buyer bears all the shipping costs.
2, if you don't return the item, we will refund you 1,000 yen.
(I counted, the shoes cost over 4000 yen, counted as 200 rmb, choose 1, I don't have shoes, the loss is 200 yuan ▽)
Option 2, I have shoes, I was compensated with 2000 yen, I lost 150 rmb. Customers: We have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously, the next day I got back an email saying that I do not accept Chinese customer mediation, and that's it.
I suggested that the page to buy was 7c, 8, 9c, and that was a confusing option, but the Chinese customer service told me that the Japanese code would not be a c, like 140, but did you go to other pages about caterpillars?
The Japanese language is also used in the country, but it is not the same as the Japanese language.
And why did you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, the smallest size, and what did you mean by that?
Chinese Service: We provide Chinese language service, but we don't know that you are going to be sent back to China, so we won't be responsible for your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic anymore, I'm Japanese, I also want Chinese suits, Chinese people living in Japan don't need Chinese suits, go to Japan as a tourist, without that kung fu to make long international trips, then the question arises, who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phones, just like me who is a day-to-day scout.
Amazon's Chinese customer service is not helping those people who are taking our products to the market?
This purchase was not satisfactory.
This is the second time I have bought a diaper from Amazon, I bought a box when my baby was 2 months old, I chose a diaper made of European imported paper, and I was satisfied with my first purchase, my baby used a diaper all night, and it was really enough to last 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time I bought L diapers, there are 2 separate packages in one box, and when I opened it, I felt the paper was loose, and the difference was obvious, after I gave it to the baby, it was fine, there was no leakage of urine and no signs of rash.
But when the second pack of diapers was used, the baby's belly button immediately turned red and has not yet been removed.
I'm not sure if the quality of the two packs in one box is the same.
I'm not going to buy any more!
The importance of transportation protection
This is the worst package I have seen shipped in so long, with absolutely no protection, no buffer bubbles, no packaging buffer material, nothing.
The box is a deformed box.
The paper and cardboard boxes inside were crushed open and deformed.
I hope it's authentic, quality is guaranteed, and I'm afraid to buy from Amazon in the future.
I'd rather be half as expensive in the country, with some security.
And the packaging of the products, I see comments on it from people who commented on it in 2016, and now 19 years later, it's still the same.
The company's website, which is available on Amazon.com, has been criticized for its lack of service feedback, which is far from the same as that of the Japanese companies JD.com and TEN-T.
Good to see, but a little bit sad.
The color of the whole cup is my mother's favorite, red, and even though I'm a boy, I still think that red and yellow are very bright.
It's a little smaller than I thought, but it's meant to be used for carrying out, so it's acceptable.
I tried it last night when I got home, but after the lid was pushed back, the distance between the straw and the lid was too close, because the position of the straw was perpendicular, so the son always had to raise the lid above the container to drink water, to see if the place could be improved.
It seems that the other brands of straw cups have a reasonable slant on the straw, something that little kids really care about, safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large
I like it light, open, and two separate compartments are a bit redundant for me, I feel like I don't know what to put in.
The price of the product was less than two hundred dollars, but it was found that there was another brand of the same brand in overseas markets.
Fake, especially the fake ones
Amazon is selling fake products, so I'm buying them.
The customer said that they could not return the product because it was used, and I didn't know it was fake.
I'm not sure if I'm going to buy it, but I'm going to buy it because I trust it, so it's sad, after all, it's a face mask, so go to the physical store and buy it, it's a little expensive.
I have submitted my e-commerce platform to the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, let's defend it together.
Is it wrong?
What is the truth?
The tragedy of it all.
The hair was selected with the second piece carefully, but when it was opened, it had a strange smell, thought it was normal, because it had not been used, and then when it was applied to the face, it was completely unbearable, a very pungent smell, indescribable, the smell came out immediately, the eyes were very painful, tears came out, and immediately took it off to wash the face.
The same, less heavy flavor, is now being worn.
The smell of the water is a little like the smell of the bad hair in the hairdresser's hallway.
It's hard to imagine that Amazon's own skin care products will ever be able to avoid this.
You are a traitor.
When I bought it, the campaign page said that I would give a full set of three sets of 99 yuan, but when I received the goods, there was no such gift, so I called the customer and asked to show them the screenshot of the campaign, the question was who bought the goods and saved the screenshot of the website.
The aftermath
The first time you buy something on Amazon, you feel a few things, first of all, the feeling of using the product, the first is really painless, and there is no stimulating taste, in general it is very good, wait for about 8 minutes and a wipe will fall off, only a small amount of sweat and hair on it, you can't see it, so it is generally good, so after using it again and again to continue to observe, continue to use it to know.
I think this is really good anyway.
The second order from number 27 and the delivery from number 12 took 15 days, which is half a month, and the Amazon courier service was very good.
Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday, ordered on Friday, and after waiting 2 days, it's almost $12 cheaper, which means I bought 170 more (plus shipping costs), and there's a feeling of raising the price by doing something.
I've been following the price fluctuations for more than 10 days, and that's what it is, not much fluctuation.
Affordable, Japanese-made, with Chinese labels, with pellets, definitely a buyback!
The cream is fine with particles, it feels fresh, it's smooth with the back teeth, it's much stronger than some second-hand Oriental, where they say it's imported, but many things don't have Chinese labels, they don't know where they are from.
The company has also announced that it will no longer sell second-hand goods on Amazon.
I'm going to give you a suggestion, Amazon's app is not always able to fill out the list, hopefully it will improve some of the apps, and it will do better and better!
The quality of service is not at all what it used to be, and it is not what it is today.
Garbage Excellence does not take into account the needs of customers.
The hospital is open only at night for elderly patients who are uncomfortable with beds at home.
The result was that the message was sent directly to the door at 12 noon, without any prior phone call.
If delivery time is something that you couriers can decide to deliver at any time, why bother with the time and let the customer choose?
If your own logistics cannot guarantee service, then simply don't do e-commerce!
The post was originally published on the social media site @SharedPeace.org, where the post was originally published on the social media site @SharedPeace.
The order clearly has a contact number!
No one has called me, no one has called me, no one has called me, no one has called me, no one has called me, no one has called me, no one has called me, no one has called me, no one has called me, no one has called me!
The so-called complaint service of the Internet of Excellence is a bunch of aliens pretending to be there, spouting your complaint and then giving you a so-called answer.
There will be no change or compensation!
I've had similar problems with delivery times before, but this time I can't stand it, it's too much!
The book was sold in a pre-sale and the cover was the opposite of the cover, so it was obvious that the quality was poor, so why did you send the book to the customers blindfolded?
Leave a comment and no one will contact you.
The quality of service is not at all what it used to be, and it is not what it is today.
The government has decided to stop spending money on excellence.
The quality of the images is unacceptable.
As a title for a collection of ancient maps, the book is difficult to accept in terms of the selection, typography and printing of the images, some of which even have mosaics that are too blurred to be recognized.
Even if this book is not a professional map, even if it is a small illustration, it should be able to compare the vast amount of medieval documents left by our ancestors in the catalog!
(And many of the images are clear, original files from relevant industry resources), what's the difference between using such images to compose a book and not using them?
I am sorry for this kind of governance.
The text is not evaluated, but each family has its own opinion.
Overall 2 stars
I read this book in high school, but I was bored and thought that I shouldn't be obsessed with this book, because the original text wasn't very interesting to me.
Then... it fell into the pit.
The first part of the book is a bit light and fun, even if the plot is between the two communities, because it is often bloody by the blood of the gods.
As for the competition, I'm a little bit bitter about the change of times and the alternation of old and new (maybe it's my sentiment).
I've spent a lot of time studying the whole book, but I can't stop.
Full-time portrayal of characters and emotional lines is very surprising, some characters are only occasionally brought, but also leave a deep impact on people, like the character portrayed more emphasis Ye Xiao Huang Chao Tian Suo has a large number of fans, while not in the writing center characters such as Jiang Bo Bo Zhu Yunhui and others are very popular, in a competitive essay of electricity, it is not possible to find a person who is extremely disgusting, this is a success in full-time character portrayal.
And on the emotional front, there is no full-time post-mortem, which is sickening for the general netizens, and there are no beauty or rotten problems, all the people's feelings have one thing in common: they love to glorify the game, and most of them want to win honestly.
The small measures, but no big plot, everyone looks so simple and lovely.
This is probably why there are no full-time annoying roles.
The full-time IP is large, thanks to this.
The book is a cultural phenomenon, and a good book, regardless of the web version.
How much he really gives to people, a little bit of warmth, a little bit of emotion.
The anime is scheduled to be released in April this year.
I've been wanting to buy this book for a long time, but my wallet is not big enough to keep me from doing it, and then I wanted to buy it, but it was a fake, and in fact, another version was released recently, and I liked the cover art, but I was going to buy the old version first, so I looked it up on Amazon, and bought a set.
The next step is to simply talk about the situation of the goods.
● The fourth book has no plastic cover, but the book is new.
The 17th plastic book was opened, and the texture of the book was strange, as there was no other hardness.
The same situation as in the case of the 23rd and the 17th, but also harder than the 17th, but much older.
● The publishers of the individual books are different, as if the 23rd and 17th were the same publisher, and different from the others.
● Overall, I'm satisfied with the 24 boxes, which is a big one.
The young lion with the hood
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as a lost antler, but it turned out to be a lot of words!
The book was read three times before it was finished to the children, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat juice and sugar.
The lion eating the hunter is a bit uncomfortable to watch, and modern urban people are a bit unacceptable to the arrangement of being eaten by animals.
Finally, the little lion who succeeded in human society, lost himself, he was no longer a full lion, nor a full man.
Finally, only the back of the lioness, who doesn't know where he went.
Perhaps years later, the image of the lion will be remembered by the children who have grown up, and perhaps one day, when they are not thinking, they will be touched or inspired.
The collection of works with high sex ratio
I didn't know about Taschen before, but I've bought a lot of their books lately because they're so strong, both in terms of the themes and the production itself.
The largest edition, like the Michelangelo, is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this edition is the smallest, and comes in a two-volume edition with a bookcase.
The first is that it is cheap, and is divided into two volumes of over 700 pages, which are also better to read as a single volume; the second is that unlike the Michelangelo collection, which is mainly painted, the Da Vinci's black and white manuscript is the largest part of the book, and for readers with limited budgets and non-art professionals, this edition is the highest price-to-value ratio for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.
2/ The explanation of the painting part is great, there is a compositional analysis, sketch analysis and historical background (e.g. The Last Supper), but I don't know if it's a print or book size issue, some shadows are too deep in some parts of the county, I can't see the details, it's a bit of a pity.
The manuscript of the Da Vinci Code is much more rich than that of Michelangelo.
The former is already a genius, the latter is so far advanced and accomplished that it is not even possible to describe his genius.
If you only see half of Da Vinci by looking at the paintings, you will see no language at all by reading the manuscript.
Trash, who bought who regrets!
I'm not going to give a bad review, this honest trash, bought a waste of money and a horse, give a reason!
1. The time is wrong, suddenly it's January 1st, time is reset to zero.
2. The belt is of poor quality, not even brittle, and it causes blisters on the wrist.
3. Frequently misses calls.
4. The flight was delayed by five days.
5. Sleep test does not show, time is 0
6. It is waterproof.
7. Other
Logistics are too slow
The first issue of the newspaper was published on October 16, and the second issue was published on October 21, and received poor reviews.
The delivery was so bad, and the Amazon shopping was so slow, I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall satisfaction
I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was good, it had a bag with air, the camera was three-digit identical, it could also be registered on the official website, the shutter speed was 0, the rest can only be checked by time.
The delivery was very fast, the delivery boy was here, the precious items were put in the doorway, and I could not open the box in front of him to check it, I have no words for this.
The merchants have been thinking about the customer before shipping:)
The businessman was responsible enough to call and ask about the screen size of the camera, and he did think about it for the customer.
The delivery is fast.
The film is also very convenient and easy to use.
Battery not full
The machine is really good, and I wonder why it was not full when it was first charged, the charging indicator is always red.
Amazon's official feedback channel is not available, so only product reviews are available.
1. purchased the book on March 29th for 31 yuan through the pre-order, showing that it will be shipped on March 31st, and cannot be pre-ordered on Amazon at this time (because it is not yet available);
2. The book, which was released on March 31st, is blank, but you can expect to see it, and Amazon has reduced the price of the e-book to 18 yuan.
3. The two days of repeated attempts to delete and synchronize the blank book downloaded on the device, again, did not allow access to the electronic version of the commercial with the actual content, but the Amazon website has already made the book available for preview.
I have a few thoughts.
The price is not the most important issue, the key is how to replace the blank books on the Kindle with books with real content, instead of downloading them forever.
2. books that are pre-purchased should not be bought again, as the procedure for downloading a blank book after a ticket is sold is very complicated;
3. Amazon should provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues, and a place to post feedback when e-books are downloaded or used in questionable ways (e.g. job listings, online customer service, see how the official Microsoft store does it)
Not recommended reading
I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see it by memory.
The book is more a collection of fragments of life's love stories than a collection of short stories.
The tone of the book is very plain, as plain as white water, the vocabulary is pursued to the extreme of brevity, and the plot is as quiet as the main street on a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small moment in ordinary life, without beginning or end.
Finally, gathered together, the crown jewels of what we are talking about when we talk about love.
I think that this collection of novels, and its title, is like an action art, the author wants to express that love is more than the sad separation on the stage, the sea of urban legend is dry, not just you and me are like paint, love is more than this and should not be represented above, love is also life as plain as water, dull and tasteless day by day, there is also the lack of life, the escape from reality, the lack of future.
As you read this book, you may think of the couple arguing next to you, the boring marriage of the people you know, and the unpleasant feelings.
This is why I don't recommend reading it, because the writing and plot are aesthetically dull, and unless your life is as exciting or as sweet as living in a candy castle, you'll find it strange and boring.
In terms of depth of thought, the daily episodes do not illuminate or expand one's thoughts and perspectives (unlike Marx's love story during the Cholera epidemic), nor do the short episodes explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love.
The main character's marriage broke down because of those reasons?
I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much difference if you read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and style than the plot, which is also the reason why the book is a poor reading experience.
The book is suitable for reading roughly, but not looking at it carefully.
The book is logical, but not rich enough.
The article explains a lot of theories about what sales are and why, but it is weak in terms of how to do it, it only points out the direction but does not give concrete practices.
The book also feels like a puzzle.
The examples are both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and well-known people.
I don't know if this is a story for example, but it would be more convincing if some of the stories were based on the author's own experiences.
The name of the client varies.
The title is still "customer" but the text is "customer".
The e-book also has problems with misspellings, missing punctuation marks, and misnumbered pages.
In short, this book is a good introduction to the theory, but it is not suitable for those who are already in sales and want to improve their sales.
A quick guide to understanding Internet finance
This book is very shallow, and is an introductory course to help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but you can dig deeper, or you can dig deeper yourself.
The book was written earlier, but later on, we did not mention that Alipay borrowed subsidies from Weibo to train users' habits in the Great War, and today the third-party payment share is only a small percentage of what is said in the book.
Now many people go out to eat with their phones, and businesses have abandoned the use of the bank because of the high liquidity of the banks.
But I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book, which shows that the author has at least years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so that he can write such a common and easy to understand content.
It's easy to write big and tall, but it's hard to write in a way that is easy for the common man to understand.
I'm so glad you're here, and I want you to know!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not whether the salary is high or low, but whether the work is valued and appreciated enough.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the most urgent needs of human beings after the basic survival needs are satisfied are the psychological needs: the desire to be understood, affirmed, appreciated.
Indeed, for most of the people in the country, it is difficult to express love in words, even if it is with love, gratitude and appreciation, it is also impossible to say it in silence.
In this book, the author explains the five languages of appreciation: positive words, thoughtful moments, acts of service, thoughtful gifts, and physical touch.
I think it's not so much that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them to express appreciation and gratitude to those around you, whether it's family, friends or colleagues, from your heart at any time and place.
In fact, the more appreciation and gratitude we need from our loved ones, the better our lives will be.
The company has also been able to retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the number of people who quit their jobs.
Thanks to the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and worlds.
The differences between languages are more or less due to the cultural background of the Middle and West, and if there is a chance to see the original version of the author, it is believed that more will be harvested.
Thanks again to the authors and translators and the hard work of the editors!
Amazon to strictly review suspected counterfeit goods
Super poor quality, loose packaging, no percentage, even worse than the products on the roadside, no weight, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, is not a qualified product characteristic; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, has applied for a refund; is entirely a quality issue; advised merchants to wipe their eyes, rejecting substandard goods; added: bought a heart seal, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 volumes, plus several contrasting photos, further verify the product's inferiority, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, avoid economic loss and further displeasure!
Once again, expect Amazon to be as uncompromising as ever in sourcing products.
The product of Ma Ma and Tiger Tiger, and the gap between expectations
The advantages:
1. Big brands, cheap prices and so on.
Pros 2: The motor and blade are PANASONIC guaranteed, and are OK to use, but not quite what I expected.
The downside:
1. charging without indicator, this is the most basic of your power instructions are omitted, the customer who bought an estimated 300 yuan product, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, is also generous, without respect.
2. Strong odor When charged, even if only for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.
The office was tested for a day and the whole house smelled like plastic.
I'm sorry to say that this product is a bit more expensive than the Philips Philips I used before, but the quality is really good.
Small packages
The e-commerce version is smaller than the one bought in the supermarket, it should be M, the packaging is different from the picture on the product description, so-called new version.
Three stars is the fault of Mahou for not reading the specifications, you sold the M-code e-commerce version, I have no objection, what do you mean by the wrong version?
I've been to the supermarket a few times, but I've never been to the mall.
The name of the girl is Zhiv.
I don't like the taste.
The children don't like the smell of toothpaste, they say "toothpaste" every time, maybe it's better to use another word, it's the only word in their vocabulary for now.
I bought it at the event, it was cheap, so I'm not ashamed to give it a bad rating, four stars, but I won't buy it again.
The original container is in good condition
The packaging is complete, with inflatable bags, and there is no online commentary on the product, only the appearance of a naked product.
The bottle is also packed with a plastic film as shown in the picture, and the delivery was quick, arriving the next day.
It's a genuine product, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be available again.
The first was a shopping experience that was not pleasant.
The black five time of the order, the result is waiting for a long time has not been received, the next enquiry, the package has been cleared, asked the colleagues around all said there was no help in the acceptance, hurry to contact the courier company, but said that the sender can initiate an enquiry, contacted Amazon customer service, and waited more than ten days, finally figured out that the courier was mistakenly delivered to someone else, and several weeks to turn around before finally get back the courier, the outer packaging has been dismantled goods, is still intact, and do not know if it has been used, it's a bad feeling.
The wrong map
I thought I would get a headset like Figure 1, but I got a headset like Figure 2, and the pictures didn't match, what does it mean that the sound was different in size and shape?
Although the names are the same, please be careful and please ask the Amazon manager to replace the correct layout in time.
Operating system in general
For a while, the overall picture was fine, but I didn't feel any difference, the system was a bit slow to start, and the software was not very good to set up, and the response speed was more general, and compared to my colleagues, it was not a quantity.
I've seen comments about the humanized design, but I can't find any humanized ones, and the remote control is a commonly used up and down position, and the return key design is really not complimentary.
So, let's use it as a TV, and then add a TV box and so on.
The price reduction is too much.
The price reduction was so great, more than a hundred now 99!
Amazon has accumulated a lot of unrated orders, so I've put together a sentence from the copy as a review.
If I use this phrase to evaluate this product, it means that it has at least 85 points.
I would not sneak in and copy and paste reviews of inferior products, so that other consumers can use them as a reference when they buy, and merchants can improve the quality of their products.
The low-cost phone is good, and it's enough to keep you warm!
The cheapest cable, but it should be HDMI certified, in comparison to the cheapest cable in China (the price is twice as expensive), the cable is thick and soft, and the 7 meter transmission is noiseless, so the low price line is better!
Amazon's after-sales service is really worse than other sites.
After placing the order, I found the wrong link, but I can't cancel the order, the web page Contact Online Customer Service has been showing the wrong link, and I can't be contacted.
When the delivery arrived, the delivery person called me and I said I didn't want it anymore, I wanted to cancel the order but it didn't work out, so the delivery person took it back and said to give me the receipt first and let me apply for a refund.
The only way to know if a product is a non-returnable item is to ask for it back, and you can't call Amazon customer service to tell them that it's not a non-returnable item.
I have bought items in both JD and Suning that are not returned, including milk, diapers, etc. and the customer service was returned, and the customer service in JD was returned after the opening of the diaper, which was too big, and you can't get it on Amazon.
The law is dead, the man is alive, how do you deal with your clients?
Tell me that I can either take it myself or have the courier buy it for me, it's not easy for the courier to take it for everyone, why should I let people save money to buy something that I don't buy?
I'm not going to back down, I'm going to take it myself, but I have to give you a point for your service.
The first is to avoid wasteful spending.
First, I was looking forward to buying it, I thought that the Doral brand should not be bad, but when I received it, I thought the packaging was fine, the head was good, but there was a box that was basically soft and soft, the appearance was not visible, if you touch it, it had no taste at all, it had no taste, it was a dark yellow color, it was bad, it was sold badly, it could not eat less than a third of it, I advise you not to buy it, it is not cheap, its quality is too bad!
Eat a lot and never buy fruit from e-commerce again!
Where is the anti-counterfeiting logo?
The bottle is so deeply embedded in the bottom, it should have been caused by a strong impact, from the outside of the packaging bag, the degree of friction is disturbing, after all, the packaging of food is too simple, and still belongs to international purchase, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, the opening of the bottle is very easy, the key is that a layer of honey in the lid directly emerges from the inside, with an opening that is almost non-sticky, is this the case with foreign products?
I'm not sure I understand this, since I was born in China.
It should be authentic, right?
I was also told that the number twenty came, this is the number 14, I'm buying it for the first time overseas, just to write down my doubts, maybe it's normal?
The delivery service needs to be improved
I bought 5 delivery tickets in total, when I took them out, I made the first appointment to take 3 tickets, but only 2 were sent, after many contacts, it was confirmed that they were missing, and I promised to send them again; the second appointment, just in time for the holiday, the website and WeChat did not have any information about the need to make an appointment on weekdays, which caused unnecessary panic, and suggested improvements later.
Good shopping
The food is good!
It is also more convenient to buy things from overseas, and the logistics time to buy from abroad is a few days longer than in the country, but I have to say that Amazon's overseas purchases to the domestic clearance capacity is still very strong, much faster than the transportation, so now many things are purchased overseas.
I hope the quality and price of the domestic products will be better, many things are domestically produced, but going out and buying them is cheaper than in the country, I hope for improvement.
Waste
When you see a package like this, ask yourself: Does it look like trash on the side of the road?
Is it responsible for a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany, a plastic bag that comes from Germany?
I see this packaging as a waste, buying this product, its packaging and its simplicity, without any measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag, when it comes to hand, the package is completely deformed, the items inside are also damaged.
If I just happen to see one of these, I admit, and buy a few of these, I go to Amazon and they say it's a return, but the shipping is paid for, and the shipping is returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I'll tell you what, I pay for the shipping in cash, you give me the gift card back, so I'll have to buy your gift card myself, or send the product to the German warehouse myself, it's not a crime to buy a product!
I've been telling customers who is responsible for this problem, but they don't say half the words that it's their responsibility, they don't even dare to say half the words that it's their responsibility, what is the guarantee of this after-sales service?
Good quality, 5 stars, poor logistics
1, Good quality, second hand, moderate price, and above average value.
2, solid, with good material, strong anchorage, well-treated surface, good color.
3, Logistics is a tough one, the one under number 3, number 11 is here.
4, I would be happy if Amazon didn't have a February 7th estimated delivery date.
5, but the expected delivery time is equivalent to giving the user a promise, when the promise can not be met, the user is very difficult.
6, if you are not sure of the promise, do not make the promise.
In fact, I care a lot about the promises made by businessmen.
So, I scored low.
The yellow line will fade.
The effect is there, but whether it is felt is a matter of personal preference, or psychological effect.
The one thing that's not so good is the gold thread, which is designed to look good, but in reality, the gold thread will fade and go to the car, and if you move it a few times, on your hand, and on the car, there will be some gold powder.
Hopefully the product will improve.
This is a square, and without any decorative effect, don't mess with the gold line, fall down and get dirty in the car.
Everything is fine, we can go fast, but the packaging is different.
8 days is quite fast, but 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously one is too much, thick cardboard is attached, sealed with plastic, the outer packaging is also easy to remove, one is similar to the domestic courier box, put a few buffer gas bags even if it is, feel a little overlapping.
Yalan Mattress is a good one.
34 cm mattresses are not as thick as usual, so don't sleep directly on the mattresses.
The quality is good, both the front and back are soft, sleeping is comfortable, and you fall asleep quickly lying on it.
The mattresses were received with a bit of a stain due to the courier's violent transport, and Yalan's customer service was very responsible and efficient in contacting to resolve the issue.
Amazon is not a self-made product, it's shameless
The page clearly states that the product is self-supplied, but is actually delivered by the supplier. After the sale, the supplier is responsible for the product. If you have any questions, contact the supplier yourself.
To cancel an order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, can not be canceled; to exchange goods, successfully applied for a return on Amazon, sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier yourself to return.
This is a self-made product.
The goods are not delivered by Amazon, after the sale Amazon does not take care of it, customer service says that I should help you contact the supplier, and also claims that it is self-employed, it is too shameful, naked do not face, naked to defraud consumers!
The experience was depressing.
The filter was good, and after 28 days, it was still free of scale after another day or two.
Since I have always been able to buy quality products from Amazon, this time I wanted to buy here, I bought the filter core for the first time on Amazon, it didn't feel good, not only did it start to have scale early on, but the filter core was used until the 28th day, there was a small black carbon powder floating, I didn't know whether to continue using it, or just throw it away.
It's not as good as I thought it would be.
Compared to the plugboard I have used before, the exterior works as usual, the interior is not disassembled, but as described by the shop owner, from the ease of use, each separate unit is not equipped with a power supply
The packaging is damaged, so it is time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is damaged, the inside box looks new, but the instructions are not new, it was renovated in September, it's in stock, hopefully it won't be bad by then, please explain to Amazon why several customers mentioned damaged packaging, but you can be safe, thank you!
Overall, good, but a little problem.
The first time I bought a water pump, I read some reviews, felt that the cost of LAICA was higher than the cost of this one, received the goods according to the instructions, the filter core was installed, tried it, it felt good overall, but when pouring the water, it seemed that the original water would mix with the treated water from the pump mouth (the original water storage is not sealed very strictly).
When you use it, you must filter all the water and then pour it out!
The image is incomplete.
The picture doesn't show the details on the side, the details on the side don't match the style of the subject, there is a big difference, this is one; the beads are made in Thailand, there is no indication of the origin, this is the second; there is no indication of the texture, this is the third; when I bought them in England, there was a box for each item, there was only a simple plastic bag, and there was no product logo on the beads, which I found to be fake.
The Chinese government has also issued a warning to Hong Kong residents to be careful when buying, especially if it comes from Hong Kong.
Amazon's customer service is terrible.
The order was placed two days ago, today I received it and found that it was 40 dollars cheaper, it took a long time to find the customer, the customer said that they could not make up the difference in price, they can buy it again and return it.
This customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than some of the other deals.
It's worth it to start as a newcomer.
I've seen the prices in the market before, and I'm sure they're hundreds, but this is my first time playing with it.
Things are good.
The mail was good, sent to my girlfriend, but I was a little uncomfortable when I wasn't at Canada Express at noon, the logistics company put the mail directly in the mailbox and sent me a confirmation text message that the item had not been received, which made me run for my life.
But the baby is really good.
It's worth the purchase.
I ordered it last night and received it this afternoon, it was very fast.
The postman is also responsible.
We are all in this together.
A customer confesses
1 When you receive a piece of scrap like this, Amazon customer service tells you not to rush, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then in the middle you contact the customer service, they tell you that the issue will be dealt with by the commissioner, who will inform you of the result.
You never get in touch with the Commissioner, you don't know her work number, you don't have a direct line, you don't get in touch with her, she gets in touch with you.
The tragedy is that after waiting for almost 3 days, the Commissioner contacted me, my phone went out for a while, and I did not receive the Commissioner's call.
I waited for 2 hours and didn't get a call from the commissioner, but I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed the customer service to call me back.
4 Almost 3 days later, I still don't know what Amazon will do with the coffee machine I received from the scrap!
5 There is no problem with Amazon in the US, and it is a good way to shop abroad, but it is much worse than the service offered to me in Asia.
6 As for me, I shall keep in expectation...
The bottom is not flat
Because the reviews are very good, all of the cooking is very much expected, when you get your hands are very happy, very easy, but when you open the cooking found the problem, the bottom of the cooking is not flat, the middle of the bulge, around the bottom, oil ran around, deliberately bought the cooking fat burst a lot of oil could not cover the central area, the paste, the opening can not open, such a structure estimated that the dish can not cook normally.
I don't know if I was unlucky, but I got a really bad soup, and thanks to Amazon's one-month return service, it was cancelled.
I brushed my hair and cleaned it, and left after half a day.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes
It's a very simple design.
The designers have treated the top of the cube as a tiny arc.
It should have been a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.
The water tank is covered by a top cover, and the control panel is on the front.
The top cover's curve is not consistent with the curve of the control panel, and the height difference between the two is about 2 mm.
Although it seems like a small gap, it is a huge one.
But it's a bit like destroying the whole design.
I'm sorry for the product designer.
It seems that the product managers of the company are not yet capable of creating products of this standard.
(For the feedback of the after-sales lady, of course, can not ask too high, but when I heard after-sales said that all the individuals of this product are like this, not only I bought this one with a problem, her uncertain and honest burdened emotions made me understand that the beauty can not ask too high) 2019-7-7 water pump failure water output is low, has been repaired for the second time, after the first repair, it broke again two weeks later.
Amazon's fake offer is sad
The baby is born in the first week of the month, and the temperature is super high.
The outer surface of the pump does not absorb any heat, which means that it can effectively protect the temperature without being exposed to the heat.
The temperature of the air conditioned room can still be high after a night.
Amazon said that the annual event had 320 deals, and then it turned out that there were 249,289,299 people, and for a moment there was a feeling of being cheated, but it was still cheaper than the same price in the supermarket, and in the future it will be possible to take it with you.
Vitamix Vitamix 6300 is a brand of vitamin C that is sold in the United States.
I've been waiting for a long time to see the Meia 6300 discount, and I'm looking for the same price in Central Asia and overseas, so hurry up.
I ordered on September 2nd, and the delivery was scheduled for September 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days ahead of schedule, and very fast!
The packaging is small, and it's in the original packaging of Vitamix, and Amazon is not afraid of the breakage of the floating sea!
The machine looks brand new, the accessories are complete, the cups are shaking on the base, I'm afraid to start the machine and the cups will fly out!
Asked a friend who has 5200, he described it as being so relaxed without me.
The randomly attached recipes are all in English, and it looks boring, and I can't find the Chinese version online, which is a hassle!
I was in a hurry to buy a transformer when I received it, and it was estimated that it would arrive in 3 days, so I'll be glad to have it folded!
The material is too small, no casing, and general.
It's not a big deal!
The second is the Totes, 1. This is the one without the hood 2. The handle material is general 3. The name is clearly written Large, which is actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and two people can use it to estimate the size of the umbrella.
The one that was bought in Maya, on the other hand, could be used by three people without pressure.
I'm not feeling well.
First, the box is not very firm, with a push and a deformation, then the back design of the flattened when the box surface to prevent the ABS flower and can not work, again, the box is a piece of cloth wrapped, the lever pointed out... etc., various dissatisfaction, finally the chain a little bit not smooth.
PS: The wheel feels really good.
It's all right.
Pros: The shoulder bag is more refined and looks more durable.
Disadvantages: The card's 2D code cannot be erased ((what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot be removed ((it's a little longer than that), the shoulder strap can be locked, but without a lock for the buyer, which is not a great service.
The whole thing is fine, but I don't know if it's leather.
The overall feel is good, and you can't judge it without knowing if it's leather.
A document of A4 size can be loaded, but a box of 80 pages thick, but too thick and too hard (not deformable) is estimated to be unloaded.
The bags are soft, the compartments are more human, and they are quite nice.
I'm not sure if it's my personality or the fact that I have a little eye on the bottom of my hand.
I had to go back and forth to change the goods, but I couldn't bear it.
Overall, it's worth four stars.
ForRoyal windshield worldwide camera strap
The design of the back strap is scientific, shoulder-mounted, practical, and the camera is secured and protected in the chest with soft materials, unlike other fast guns, which use screws to secure the bottom of the camera, and it is also convenient to take photos.
After-sales service
I bought a piano a month and a half ago, and it was missing a part, Amazon gave me a call after the sale, after many communications, the part is still not received, please ask what efficiency is this!
I'm not sure if it's the same as the one in the previous post, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to think that the problem is more difficult to fix after the estimate, and that the friends who are expecting a good sale will have to go around the corner, it's too much!
It's a little flawed, but it sounds good.
The head is defective, one horn is missing, it feels like a scrap, and there is no gift, but the price is good, and the sound is good.
And the first one,
I've been using it for a long time, and it's not bad, except for the bass.
The work is not as perfect as I had imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem, all the lights were flickering and not working.
The shipment arrived in Shanghai three days ago and has not been delivered yet.
The phone calls to the delivery service are not answered.
The courier company said they had only that contact.
Amazon has no complaints to be found.
I was not asked to postpone the delivery, but I was asked to postpone the delivery - and I got a text message saying:
What's next for the mediation issue?
The poor shopping experience has led to doubts about the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I don't think I'll be able to get it today either.
The label is too sticky and waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not covered with a film; and the label is poorly adhesive, so it is not suitable for cable labels, and it is very easy to fall off, so friends who buy and use cable to organize need to pay attention.
The pencil is still available, but the packaging is too simple, it's a cardboard box, there are no protective measures, and the box for the pencil is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, and the glue is torn off and put on the box.
This is what happens to 600 yuan worth of things, a disappointing purchase.
But it's not a problem.
I hope the packaging will be improved!
The quality of the writing is not as good as 925-25
I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get your order in the mail, but I'm not sure I can find a way to get it to you.
I've been using 925-25 for a long time, it's very good, I just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is not to say, the style is very beautiful, the reason for giving four stars is because the pen is a little heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjusts the length of the fountain pen a little, personal opinion: 925-25 is more fluent than 85.
So it became Amazon death powder
The price of the pencil is very low, so the children don't like to read.
I've unsealed it, tried to request a refund, and got it for free.
It's too much.
The company is not promoting returns, but it is the only one in China that offers this service.
I hope it's not abused.
The book was published in the year of the first edition of the book, and the books were later moved to this place.
The headphones are too loud, and there's noise.
I don't know if it's my ears or if the headphones are really not as good as they used to be.
I bought a blue one two years ago at a local store, the sound quality is good, no noise, no bass, and after more than two years of bad use, I'm going to buy another one (urbeats), and it still feels good.
I also saw a purple one that looked pretty good, so I bought this one today, and I just opened it and it didn't feel right, it was both loud and soft.
At first I thought it was the sound effects of the song, but after listening for half a day I realized that the problem was serious, not only the distortion, the bass sound effect was not good, but there was some noise, is it only the purple I bought that has this phenomenon? or is the headphone manufacturing process really not working now?
The review was rather poor, and I was disappointed.
The return must be made by tomorrow morning.
PS is good
The AV is a complex setup, roughly shaped, and produces a lot of heat.
The voice is going to take a while to evaluate!
The German version of DN1080 was released on August 14th.
1. The front panel and the knob are made of plastic.
The backboard audio input socket, horn output terminals are very bad, and the CD power unit of 1000-2000 is much better than this one.
3. The top cover was thin, my transformer side was too far down, and I had to unpack it by hand to restore it, and the top cover and the front panel were loose.
4. The entire machine is oriented towards the transformer end, and is not twisted when moving.
It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, just working, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony is better off working for China than the Chinese.
5. The machine is heating up, the two-way channel used to watch movies for about 2 hours, the top cover is touched with your hand and has 40-50 °C, I don't know if the transformer is too big to generate heat.
The estimated weight of this huge transformer is 4 kg.
Sony should have used a silent fan inside the machine that actively dissipates heat, and when unpacked, only large aluminum plate heat spreading chips on the pipe should be visible.

And then I thought, well, if you take it down, you're disappointed, and you're wrong to spend all that money, and if you take it down, you're happy, and it's hard to put it back together, and it's not fun to wear.
I'm not sure if this is the case, but I'm not sure if it's the case.
As for the details of the electricity, the average person is going to be amazed.
I'm fine, I've worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time, and I'm half battery engineer, except I don't know anything about circuits.
I was so happy.
I was really confused before buying it, and it felt good until I opened the package!
When I finally touched the headphone cord, it felt so soft and so good quality, I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone to play QQ Music.
I was amazed that the sound was surrounded by 3D!
I asked in the physical newsroom, about 30 or so, but it's not a Vintage brand, it's a mixed brand, so I say this Vintage is worth owning, even though it's 27 bucks, but the price is absolutely worth it!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing the order on September 28, the system shows that the order has been shipped, and the result is that the order has not been received until October 12.
Check the status of your order on Amazon, the seller does not provide the delivery number, and you cannot find where the order is.
So I emailed the seller asking if they could provide the delivery number, and after two days, there was no response.
I called the seller again, and after a few calls, the phone rang, and they told me that the delivery was lost, and that they could send me another one right away.
Although I was especially angry, I didn't say much to the seller because of the urgent need for the computer, so it was better to send it to me immediately.
The next day, I called to ask if the shipment had arrived.
The seller said no, it will be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, the seller said it would be sent, and it was delivered after 5-6 pm, but when I called again at 7 pm, no one answered.
Did I call again the third morning and ask for the goods to be sent?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said no, tell me if I'm in a hurry, I'll order from another place, if possible, wait until the afternoon.
I can't wait to order from someone else.
The only thing we can do is ask the seller to send it quickly.
After a lot of phone tracking, I finally received my computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it was bought for someone else, so add comments later.
I bought it six months ago, haven't used it for a few times, and now it's badly damaged, can I have it repaired?
I have a desktop computer, but I haven't used it much since I bought it.
I've only used it a few times in my suitcase.
Recently, it was discovered that when connected to a power source, the charger does not charge, and the charger and the wire need to be held with the left hand and right hand to charge the connection points.
I wonder if it's a problem with the interface, or if it's something that can be fixed now?
Amazon strongly recommends that you stop using EMS!
The first is the cost of the goods, the second is the cost of the logistics, and the third is the cost of the service.
I don't know why Amazon sends EMS, which is not trustworthy in the industry, well, computers are also valuable items!
The order said that the 20th was expected, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take 45 days to get from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
The 22nd morning, Cha Logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready to receive the goods, and as a result, in the evening, without receiving any phone calls or text messages, Cha Logistics was finally accepted at noon, and the person who signed it was also shown!
I was shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I'm not sure what to do with my life.
The computer was finally returned after running for a generation.
The reason for this is simply that the delivery boy has misplaced the two numbers, so that the item is not lost.
I strongly recommend Amazon not to use EMS, and I will definitely not buy it again if Amazon sends it to me via EMS.
Good stuff
First of all, I just bought a few days to find the price reduction, bad reviews, it is still good, the price is high, the cpu and graphics card is enough to cope with the mainstream online games and a considerable part of the large single computer, heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little leaky (the epidemic of the screen ip), the sound quality is not very good, the hard disk is not good (recommend to spend some money to add a solid state), yesterday took the after-sale to detect the hardware, no problem, the win8.1 is not very good, recommend upgrading to 10, the seller ships quickly, all inquiries are answered quickly, the next day the computer received the ticket, well, unfortunately there is nothing to send.
(By the way, don't go to a store called E Cool Digital Center to buy a keyboard sticker, the shipment is slow, the quality is poor, the product has problems and cannot be replaced, the boss is full of dirty words, especially expose it)
Things are good, the platform bureaucracy is still there
The quality of the hard drive is very good, the price is absolutely high, it is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, it is definitely recommended to buy it if you are not in a hurry and can withstand the logistics.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same, it's not much better than it was a few years ago when I swore it was absolutely useless, you never see the actual logistics, the information is always weeks later, you can never complain, it's so bureaucratic!
The delivery is a few days away, the logistics information is still 10 days away, and you will receive the goods!
Logistics is not a concern
The packaging is not only open, but also the electrical packaging is open, and it is not known if the package has been changed.
FYI
The company has not tested the device yet, and has always relied on Philips to give it a longer battery life than other brands.
I checked online, it could be waterborne disease and there is no warranty.
The flower!
Now, how long will it be wrapped in a preservative?
I bought it when someone else had it removed.
The tax on more than 300 machines is really high, but the tax on more than 600 machines is more balanced.
When the receipt of the seal of the chip looks very bad, like it was opened, hurried to take a picture, then tear it open, opened the inside of the cardboard and damage, fear that someone else back, before the anniversary rushed to test the husband, the machine has no electricity, better the knife head without scum, or not big old far back!
It's not clear if it's going to be useful or if there will be any short-term problems, but as the previous review said, the stuff sent out when it's out of stock is really not reliable!
The experience is superior.
There are many different types of toothbrushes, but few people change their brushes every day.
I have been using it for 6 months without any problems, brushing daily, and almost 1 more than Monday.
The brush head accessories are also cheaper on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, other than changing the colors, other seeming compatibility issues are the reason for the overseas version?
I hope to learn more about the law.
The price is high.
It's been used 3-4 times already.
1  Packed
2. Very easy to use and easy to clean.
3 - You can do it yourself and save money.
All in all, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes.
Last time I bought two packages, actually two different versions, the words in the bottom left corner of the packaging were green, but one of the packages was not, it was white, and the cat ate the cat and pulled the belly.
I'm not sure if the Amazon source is fake or if the shipment was packed by the staff.
I will buy another one, and if it is fake, I will hold you responsible.
It's a lie!
Amazon pictures are italic, and I get the horizontal ones, isn't that a scam?
It worked.
The cat likes to eat, that's the point.
It is also effective.
The first is the "Tight, narrow, squat, back rub" of the feet.
Not recommended
1.UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, but this one is too bad.
Added: Today's comparison with the previous UN series of shoes (shoes that are thrown away and left to use), the material is much worse than before, less elastic than before, not as breathable as before, so it is a fake soft.
2. My feet are not very tall, and the ankle is about 3 cm forward at the top of the foot.
3. Three pairs of clarks bought abroad, only one pair fit.
I'm afraid I deleted all the music from my collection.
I'm going back to Rockport, and I'm going to the Echo store instead.
The next time, it's better, but the taste is not good.
First of all, it is worth noting that Prime's overseas purchase of UPS was very lucrative, and the number 6 under the number 31 was received.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, the skin feels good.
The shoe is a little bit larger, 25 feet long, 10.5 wide, 7.5 W, and the upper leg is a little loose, but I usually like to wear loose, and I wear a pair of shoes just right.
Secondly, the taste control of the shoes is really bad, one of the soles is broken, the other has scratches and a pinhole, the soles are connected with the soles of the shoes with the wrong bars, and the soles are perfect!
A little bit of regret!
The price of the event was 280 Rupees, which is a fairly reasonable price to buy Arthur, but of course there are lower prices to see in the reviews.
Now let's talk about shoes, the advantages: they are light, comfortable to run, fit well, and do not loosen.
The quality is high but the drawbacks are obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, this time I bought 40.5, and the front of the shoe is about 1 thumbs away, but it doesn't matter.
The shoes are very tight, and although there is a gap in the front, it feels tight.
And the shoes probably don't breathe very well, and now I feel hot in my feet.
The foot is pressed against the back.
First of all, the shoes work well, and are worth the price.
I have a very standard foot, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, Amazon love shoes have also bought a few pairs, never had a mismatch, but these pair I refer to the comments, buy a uk7, upper foot because the length of one yard is obviously biased, but because the shoe is too thick, or the pressure on the back of the foot is strong, plus hiking shoes are very hard, causing the upper foot is very painful.
If you are not particularly thin, this is not recommended.
If you have to buy a new pair of shoes, it's a good solution, but the original pair of shoes look very high-end, no need and a pity.
It was a perfect shopping trip!
Very satisfied, very like, Amazon overseas purchase is authentic, no doubt, the quality is very good, the price is cheap, buy reassurance, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service is very friendly and friendly, handling problems patience and efficiency, perfectly solved after-care concerns, the delivery of the delivery delivery is very convenient and secure, the delivery man is very thoughtful about the customer, every time will remind you to pick up the goods from the delivery cabinet, thank you Amazon to provide customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, we all love shopping on Amazon overseas!
This is a terrible comment!
The company is not a good example of a company that is not a good example of a company that is not a good example of a company that is not a good example of a company.
The same applies to the Amazon store, which is a very popular place for buying electronic products.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm going to have to do it.
The winter ones, less than 200, are left at home for months without use.
The two devices were found to be incompatible with each other in the spring, and the instructions for each device indicated that they were compatible with each other. Later, it was discovered that the problem was the heart rate band, because the other devices were not compatible.
Call Amazon and let me contact the agency, and the agency let me send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After almost half a month, the items were returned in their original packaging, and even the box was the same as the one I had used when I sent them!
No response and no reprimand and no test report!
You can tell me if it's good or bad!
It's good to call and ask, and to send back a message that the equipment is fine.
But I couldn't get in, and the agency replied: "That's none of their business".
Even if I'm lucky, I'll be punished for something worth 200 dollars.
The seriousness of the situation is not clear.
The very wrong board.
The headband is very well made.
It's better than Nike.
The air is very good.
The hat in front of me.
Very small.
Do you want to make fun of me?
The sun is not shining on the ground.
No refunds because it's a good headband.
The sun is not shining, but the sky is shining.
The headband is different from the other headbands.
Keep it.
The quality of the goods is good, the lack of contract spirit on Amazon, the delivery man is good.
I ordered the delivery on Saturday and Sunday!
Amazon has a rule that you can't deliver on Saturdays and Sundays.
I'm sorry, I had to drive 200 km from the country to get my goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person was very positive and enthusiastic.
Give it a go!
Goods, just a taste, and good.
But I have never bought anything like this before, so it's not comparable!
Size and logistics
I can still do the work, the logistics are too slow, the previous shoes were DHL, this time Apex is really... I bought a lot of UA in the country, the price is not low, it feels like it is higher than the NIKE ADIDAS?
I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it's a good idea.
Size: I'm 176cm, 68KG, my shoulders are 180 in general, I bought M, the bottom is slightly longer, the others are well dressed, I see that there is a recommended S-code, is the body so slim? Or do you like tight? I think the hat is loose.
The right size.
Breastplate 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, before buying consulted customer service was told to buy xxxl, then read the comments decided to get L, after receiving the goods found the size is correct, almost was dug.
The price of the Double Eleven is much higher than that of the Black Five.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Z's Affordable Goods are a problem!
The number 18 is the number of the order, the goods were received on the 25th, the speed of the cattle from Guangzhou to Beijing!
The product was purchased at Z Discount, the description said it had scratches, but when we received it we found that it was missing 4 screws and nuts!
The child didn't want to return the item, and didn't have much of a problem, but the accessory was such a small part that the child ran to the nearest hardware store and didn't buy it!
Finally, the glue!
It seems that Z Affordable is no longer available!
The quality of the toys is poor.
The bolt holes are mostly out of alignment, the top bolt is very difficult, the quality of the workmanship is not good, and you don't know how long you can play, because it is what you promised the child, and it does not go back.
I'm not sure if this is the only problem with the one I bought, but I'm sure it's the only one that's not installed.
Very common
Is it my bad luck?
The packaging is old; the work is common; the music is one and only eight seconds long and then repeated; the movement is to shake your head and go back and forth, without any change.
It's not worth it.
No refunds for urgent use.
The quality of the toys is good, spit out the packaging
Yesterday I received a courier, Amazon bought it, marked EMS shipping, and finally the courier from Tmall came, how many coins did it turn?
And then there's the packaging, which is several layers of preservative film, not even a plastic bubble wrap, open a look, all the parts are in an empty box, good quality toys, no broken parts, is too much than imagined, because not with batteries, hand pushing often off track, feel the gaps on both sides of the track are too large, the design is not reasonable.
Quality and fun
It's fun, the components are very precise, the workmanship is very good, the quality is almost like Lego, and the price is very good for the activity.
The process of assembling was fun, I was there, my five-year-old son was there, it was fun.
He joked that he would probably continue to buy the brand's toys for years to come.
The new machine is good at tapping.
I bought it for $150 at Christmas, but it's a little slow to ship.
The machine is good, it's new.
The built-in pickaxe.
Then the words that connect the elf balls will send a dream.
It's a good game, and it's more portable than the PS4.
I've already bought a Zelda, wait for the game, try again.
Producing bad goods, selling bad goods, and then selling bad goods, buying six watches to send to the kids, one of which shows incomplete numbers, and the six watches are not consistent, with a difference of ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked if the watches were checked in stock? They replied that if there were, then why the difference in the checking time was so much, it must be that the watches were not accurate, simply put, they were water cargo products, not what I said.
I contacted the sellers, and they gave me a bunch of reasons, and they complained about the products they shouldn't have bought, the sellers, the after-sales service, and who would ever buy anything on Amazon.
I would recommend not to buy from this seller, it is also junk.
Amazon shipping issues
The inspection found:
1  The packaging is badly damaged
2/ The form was used in a serious way.
3 ∙ The clock is not working, the lamp is not charging, and the time cannot be adjusted ◦
The first is to contact Amazon Customer Service, and the second is to contact Amazon Customer Service, and the third is to contact Amazon Customer Service, and the fourth is to contact Amazon Customer Service, and the fourth is to contact Amazon Customer Service, and the fifth is to contact Amazon Customer Service.
The reason for the 5 and 2 points is that the customer service is good.
All I can say is, it's a match.
The time is not very accurate, it is about a second faster every day, and it has been two minutes faster for a few months.
I've used a piece of Western Iron before, and I feel like it's going to last a year or two.
The calendar is a good one, but the timing is a bit clumsy, it's not really useful, and sometimes you can get it into the wrong time mode.
Solar sports watches
Pros: Solar charging without worrying about changing batteries, world time, multiple batteries and full-time reminders.
The mirror is scratchy and dusty.
Price: The average price in the country is between 220-300 and overseas is more than 180 (about 1 week).
Satisfied watch
It must be authentic, go to the counter to check the goods, the appearance of the table is beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the material is used, plus the imported mechanical movement, so there is a certain percentage, those three or four hundred so-called mechanical table can not be compared, this is the real value of the goods.
The time of the watch is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, the packaging of the watch has a certificate of jewelry authentication, the 12 words on the dial are real diamonds, this is very suitable to wear yourself, and it is very face to give as a gift.
The Bentley table is really good.
One of the worst shopping experiences ever
On the night of September 23, my wife's phone fell off, and my heart raced. Amazon ordered an 8p, which was available but not self-made and without any price increase (my heart was happy), and since the non-self-made shipment was slow, the system showed that the latest expected delivery was until September 27.
My wife died without a cell phone, so the next morning at 6am I called to find out what to do, and then I went to Tokyo to see if there was a 256G that could be delivered that day, but I had to order another one right away.
The new one is a good one, and I want to cancel the Amazon order right away.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was not possible to receive the courier in the early morning, so after 7 am I called customer service to cancel the order, and the customer service replied that it had been canceled. Please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I waited patiently, and at noon I looked at the handset, the order was still in the same state and had not been sent, I immediately contacted customer service to cancel the order, and the customer service replied that it was OK.
At 3pm, the order was still there, so I had no choice but to call customer service again and tell them that it was the third time, please cancel the order and tell the seller not to send it!
The customer service contacted the seller at my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and that they would have to wait until they were familiar with the system to cancel the order.
But make it clear that the seller knows about it and will not ship it.
I was surprised to see the order on Monday, and it was already shipped.
Since the seller cannot be contacted directly, the customer service can only be contacted again.
The process is simple, I say one thing and the customer service does the next.
The order is still in the "Denied" state, and is ready to be sent again!
Wouldn't Amazon follow suit?
The seller's company has already received the money and it's not a big deal if they don't follow up.
In conclusion, there is no way to pay in advance for the next big project, it's too much trouble.
It looks good.
I saw this camera a long time ago, but I didn't buy it because of other reasons besides the price, this time it was because of the packaging and the price was also good.
After buying the other is no problem, is when the software connection, how can not connect, my home is TP's router, after searching the Internet found that many people have this problem, made more than two hours, various changes in the settings of the router, finally I use 360 WIFI as a medium to fix, during the call to the customer service, they have no solution to this problem, I just let me contact Amazon for after-sales.
Another thing worth noting is that I saw some comments online that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and smaller memory cards are not recognized, so I hope you will pay attention to this.
The sound quality is poor, the machine has a certain amount of heat, and if it is turned on, it is a little difficult to accept this degree of heat.
In summary, there are many shortcomings in this product, so please be careful when buying.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it was bought with the first love of my life, who I had been with for almost 3 years, and who left me last year, until now.

When I bought this phone, I thought about how I felt at the time, that I could still suffer with Gan, but now I can't bear it, life may be like this, some people don't want to meet in their lives, some things they don't want to know in their lives, but what is the solution?
I never used a phone worth more than 2000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate to say goodbye to one person, but one day when she changed her mind, all the promises and promises vanished.

I'm not sure why I chose Huawei.
I bought it over six months ago and it feels good, very good.
The reason I didn't give it a full score was because I had a misplaced positioning when I was using it offline, and I didn't find out why, the rest of the time it was fine.
And it's also very practical to have an online destination, a search, an automatic route, and an offline navigation, without running traffic, and it's very good to have a direct satellite conversation to get the positioning and navigation, very good!

This paradox states that there is no finitely additive measure defined on the sphere that is equal to all equal subsets of each other (Housthof also demonstrates that there is no countable additive measure defined on all equal subsets), and that the structure of the groups formed by spherical rotation plays a key role here - and this narrative is not valid on the plane or line segment; in fact, Banach later proved that for all bounded sets in the plane of the Euclidean plane, it is possible to define a set that has a countable area of each other's full equivalents (this is the same as the length of the real line); however, this has a finitely additive value, so it is not a fully meaningful measure, but is equivalent to the countable measure of the countable area of each other's full equivalents, which is equivalent to the Bayesian measure of the countable area of each other's full equivalents, which represents two countable areas on the same plane or line segment.

This is supported by post-analysis; furthermore, even after controlling for various variables that may affect children's behavior, such as parental social status, the correlation between corporal punishment and misbehavior in children remains that corporal punishment itself does lead to more misbehavior in children, and that its effects cannot be explained by any other possible explanation; and there are studies that show that caring, thoughtful and supervised educational strategies can effectively reduce the incidence of bullying, while the rates of rejection and exclusion associated with bullying are correlated with the occurrence of bullying.

When additional energy is injected into an energy system in the form of electric fields, photons, chemistry, etc., and absorbed, it causes electrons to jump from low energy to high energy, and when photons generated by spontaneous radiation encounter these electrons that jump to high energy due to the additional energy, these high energy electrons are moved to the lower energy level by induction and release photons (called excited radiation). All the optical properties of the excited radiation are the same as the original spontaneous radiation: frequency, phase, forward direction, etc. These radiated photons encounter other additional energy and jump to high energy electrons, and produce more of the same photons, and the final light intensity is increasing (i.e. the light energy is amplified), while all photons have the same frequency, phase, forward direction, and forward motion.

Claude Auchinleck's own plans were broadly the same as those for Montgomery, but he also had a series of contingency plans to deal with the situation after the line was breached, including the defences of Alexandria and Cairo, which made a disagreement between the commanders over whether to defend El-Alamin or retreat (this had already arisen at the end of June over the question of defending Matrou Port). Montgomery's simplification was to abandon other options and emphasize adherence to his chosen area at all costs, which affected his explanation of his intention to his superiors and the deployment of some units to the front line (such as the 44th Infantry Division) which had previously been reserved for contingency planning.

The early description of the mycelium gate as a parasite on the surface of the host cell, lacking a cell wall, and having a morphology similar to that of a fungus, has been characterized as both atypical and endogenous, but this classification has many shortcomings. The word "hidden" means that this type of organism was long ignored by researchers until the advent of molecular sequence analysis, which unveiled the mystery. However, this characteristic applies to many other eukaryotic organisms, not patents of mycelium, and there is room for discussion as to whether the genus Rhodes is representative, since little is known about the life history of the mycelium, and it is not clear whether most species can have both the surface cell parasite and endogenous life history, so the Rhodes mycelium is not necessarily atypical.

A lawyer may defend anyone, even if the defendant is guilty of a serious crime and the evidence is conclusive. All persons accused of criminal offences, regardless of the gravity of the crime or whether the evidence is conclusive, have the right to request the assistance of a lawyer.

Since fantasy novels are mostly written by online authors, they are published on the Internet at the same time as the text is written, and often change their style during the upload process to adapt to the audience (because they have the possibility of expressing their opinions immediately, so it is more like the audience than the reader), these changes may make the novel's content often contradictory phenomenon, but as long as the plot is arranged carefully and without intention to distinguish the category of the work, the chapter theme can also be used as a distinction. If each chapter is themed in a fictional world and only a few other non-traditional episodes are added, it can be classified as a fantasy novel; if the chapter revolves around martial arts, science fiction and magic as a mere point of reference, it is considered to be a fantasy novel.

This is not reasonable, because good pen tip is often a high-quality pen and has a certain weight, and then when writing it needs to be pulled by the pen tip to make a rough effect, but the atomic pen only put the paper on the soft material to write, but can do, atomic pen is often better than the effect of the hard pen writing, the space to play is larger, but there is a certain degree of knowledge of different writing techniques, need to have more observation of the author, the pen writing requires speed, because the ink pen cannot be written too slowly and stopped at a point too long, this point is far from being lighter than the atomic pen, the only advantage of the pen is that the ink is brighter than the atomic pen.

Chapter One
Yang Ren, as his name suggests, is a good man.
His family lives in a small town in the north, where there is no legend, and if Beijing intends to build twenty rings and thirty rings, it can barely be counted as a god's foot, if the good people of the whole world are counting the words on his head, it can barely be counted as a name, walking on the street without anyone knowing, on top of a four-sided face that looks like a man's ordinary face.
The northern weather is cool, but walking on the road in the sun is also very uncomfortable, so the city center of Marlon is full of vehicles, but you can't see how many pedestrians are walking outside, and a tall young man wearing a white T-shirt, gray pants, and a normal face is one of the few pedestrians.
He felt that the students were becoming less and less professional, and that he would never have seen a single mom with such a thing in her hand when he was out working on the page-folding, but anyway, this hard-copy page-folding fan is quite appropriate.
The last two, it's not enough. Yang Yang Rin looked at the last two job ads in his hand, luckily these two places are next to each other, he can quickly get the job done today, and one of them is in front, an advertising company that is absolutely not strong from the outside, but the sign on the door of the house rings: Galaxy Media Pancultural Development and Promotion Company, the name is a must-have item in six months, Yang Yang Rin came up with the name, the main purpose is not to hire, it is to see what kind of people the owner of the company who can think of such a magical name would be.
He walked excitedly for several hundred meters to get around the road barrier, then ran over the big sun to the door of the advertising company named Special Ox X, surprised to find that the company had closed, the sign on the door was still hanging, but the notice of the closing of the gate was on the glass door, the date was two days ago, and the recruitment started four days ago...
By chance, the recruitment startup team of the advertising company threw the last one in the trash on the side of the road, Yang Rin looked down at the last one, and two seconds later, the recruitment team threw it into the same place, incidentally, he reflected on the fact that he had selected this thing two days earlier. Was it a blind recruitment office clerk of the public transport company, who required 25 to 40 years old, able to eat hard work and understand computers, with work experience preferred, gender.
He was excited to see the glass doors of an advertising agency that had been busy hiring people for two days before it went bankrupt.
Yang Yin, a gender male, a lover, 25 years old, no **** preferences, the advantage is to eat without picking up food, currently single, no friends, and lives alone in the old house left by his parents in the old city district of Shenyang, like most young men, his life goal is to achieve a monthly income of $ 10,000 by the age of twenty-five, marry a beautiful wife, if possible, it is better to have a car, parents are not able to obey, so at least live well enough to not give up on the family, and now this series of life goals has completed one third: he is twenty-five this year.
It's a sad story.
He came to the city today to look for a job, but he doesn't have much of a need for it personally: as mentioned earlier, Yang lives in an old house left by his parents, and should be thankful for the family he inherited from his parents, at least this house is big enough. It is an old two-story house that has been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For years, Yang has been renting out his house to live in, but because his place is so remote, even to the point where it would take decades to plan to demolish the old house.
With such a steady income, Yang Ren is not necessary to look for work, but this man, who has been living for too long, is a little bit cheerful, always feels that he should try a little harder, open up the path of life, and more importantly, his old house is too remote, and is too far away from human civilization. Since the last couple of migrant workers moved out of their rented houses, no one has rented a house for a year and a half, and looking at the empty two-story apartment building for several months in a row, Yang Ren suddenly realized one thing: unless the city planning is slanted towards him, he will want to live in fear of really finding a job.
After three days of studying urban planning at home, Yang Ren thought that there was little chance of his home becoming a commercial center overnight, and considering that as a big boss, he could not waste himself on this, he finally decided to find a job first, at least have an income to support his life.
How can a hardworking man who also worked and paid for his education, and who could not starve himself to death, be a good person?
But fate does not move the will of man, he runs out of the first day basically blind... and only remains blind.
After thinking about it for a while, Yang Jin decided to stop for a while under the tree benches in the park by the road, wait for the hottest hour of the day to pass, then go to a small hotel to fill his stomach, and then take the car back home.
Even with the rapid economic development, it is still possible to keep the small places cool and bright. He found a piece of paper to wipe the bench clean, then lay down and covered his face with the folded page with the logo of the women's hospital and the beautiful girl, and rested indifferently.
But just as he lay down, as if it had been less than a minute, the sunlight that had entered through the edge of the folded page had dimmed, as if someone had come next to him. Yang Ren showed his face a little unexpectedly, shocked to find that the sky was already in the sunset, and a small and thin female figure was standing next to him, which shaded the already sunken sun, because the contrasting light relationship could not see the appearance of the woman, who could only be identified by a dim outline of the short-haired slim girl on the side.
Are you awake?
At this point, the stranger seemed to finally realize that her position in the backlight was such that she could not be seen, so she smiled and shifted her body slightly so that the other person could see her.
This was Yang's first impression of a beautiful girl.
The self-made girl had a scarf and short hair, and was probably very sporty, her skin was a little wheat-colored, healthy and full of sunshine, and she was beautiful, and most striking were those big, moving eyes, more vibrant than any eyes that Yang Ren had ever seen, as if the whole spirit of a person was coming from those eyes.
Behind her is a large suitcase that looks like a bag of potatoes.
Looking at the slightly hairy Yang Ren, the short-haired beautiful girl let out an unprecedented bright smile (although it seemed a little inappropriate, but Yang Ren did think it was a joke), that smile was clean and pure, now that the age seems to have rarely seen on the face of girls of her age, the other party made Yang touch in the small bag that accompanied him for half a day, and finally found a paper with a buzzing and handed it to Yang Ren:
I'm not going to go to my house, is it? I'm going to my house, is it? I'm going to my house, is it?
Chapter 1
The morning light pierced the dark blue sea, the sky was blue, and the fish were white.
In the backwoods of the Wu Zong Academy in Shandong, a thin young man wearing a loose military robe, with his teeth on his tongue, concentrated his strength on his left and right fists, and hit a large tree.
The fist is shallow, the body is calm, the stomach is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is still, the body is alive.
The boy's name is Su Huan, fourteen years old, handsome and handsome, with a good figure and naivety.
The black hair, the stars in the sky, the eyes as bright as the stars of Venus, the wisdom that is not matched by age.
And the sun rose after three hours.
Su-hwan stopped punching, looked at the bloody fists, and sighed softly: "I have worked twice as hard as others, and the results I have achieved are less than half of those who are qualified".
You're not sure if you're going to be blessed or cursed.
Two months ago, Su-Hwan was in a plane crash and woke up to find himself in a world called the Moon Godland.
He was a member of the first martial arts school in the mainland.
It took him two months to digest the memory of his former master.
The Moon God, the continent of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods, the god of the gods.
The human being practises martial arts, climbs the peaks, reaches the transcendent and enters the sacred realm.
The martial art is divided into nine weights, each with three levels: small, big and peak.
He became a god after overcoming the nine martial arts, and was known as the "Holy King of the Martians".
The limits of the human holy king are the limits of martial arts, the limits of the pursuit of billions of people.
The rumour is that the holy king, who can move mountains to fill the sea, and move clouds to float, is powerless.
A human king, holy enough to change the fortunes of a dynasty for a hundred years, is a god-like being.
But why is it so hard to practice in this world?
Su Huan is the top genius of Qing Shan town, under the rule of the Sendai County. At the age of fourteen, he trained to become a top martial artist, becoming a hundred-year-old genius in the eyes of everyone in Qing Shan town.
But it was only after he was accepted into the Wu Zong Academy, which is above all else, that Su Han discovered what a bottomless pit he had been.
The Wu Zong Academy, the talents of the entire Shandong Province, is collected once a year.
And he, of all the geniuses of the Wu Zong Academy, is just the worst!
The Wu Zong Academy divides its students into three categories according to their qualifications.
The Golden Scholar, a genius of the elite level, is often the best in the city, suppressing the top genius of the rest of the city, and will be trained by the Wu Zong Academy.
Silver students, geniuses at the potential level, in small towns, there are high-level talents, with a little effort, maybe there is hope.
Su-hwan, the Silver student, understood that the Silver student was a kind of person who had no hope of cultivating and becoming an adult, but who abandoned and was pitiful, who ate without taste and was pitiful, like a rib.
The silver students are not well regarded, the resources given by the university for their cultivation are very limited, and the chances of starting are close to zero.
Zhao Suyuan, hurry back to the university, the Prince of Zhao is calling you! A voice of urgency, breaking through the silence of the mountain forest, a middle-aged man in a blue suit ran breathlessly up the mountain, with a few moments of anxiety on his face.
Can you be lazy, Prince of the Jungle? Come with me! The Jungle Blue is impatient, up and down, holds Su-fu's shoulders, does not care about hurting Su-fu's thin body, and grabs him down the mountain quickly.
Su-hwan bites his teeth, and with a painful shoulder, he is silent.
The blue-shirted middle-aged student is the dean of the university, managing the daily activities of the school, and in the words of the Earth School, is the director of teaching.
After half a cup of tea.
The university, a luxurious and elegant, sophisticated and dreamy lounge.
Only core members, the university's top brass and dignitaries can rest here, and no other members of the Golden and Silver classes are eligible.
Su-hwan is also the first time to come to the luxury lounge, ordinary poor children come here, maybe they will be nervous. But Su-hwan, the former life is the business elite, five-star hotel, presidential suite, luxury ball, is a regular guest, calm, humiliation is not surprised.
In the lounge there were three people, a couple of young men and women, and a man of noble character and dignity.
When she looked at the fourteen-year-old girl, Su Han stopped for a moment.
She was as fair as an elf, as delicate as a carved jade, as white as the snow in the spring, as tall as a leopard, as beautiful as a fox, and in her garments as pure as the dust.
But she looked at Su-hwan's eyes, cold and a little complicated.
And there was a young man by his side, about sixteen years old, of a stately countenance, and of a beautiful countenance, and of a noble disposition.
I am the Prince of the Jungle, and I am very glad to see you. The Prince of the Jungle, one of the three great princes of the Jungle Empire, at this time, without any arrogance, but rather unusually friendly, smiled and asked Su-hwan to sit down.
Su-hwan shook her head coldly, not at all moved for affection.
The high-ranking people, who are followed by millions of people, pay a lot of attention to their own health and their own image.
Like the politicians on earth, Ming Ming is not allowed to have a good time, but after meeting, he still shakes hands, smiles, only under the table with a knife, with black hands.
I am your father, and I have come to you for the sake of him and his son. I have heard your son say things about your handsome face, your appearance, and your smile. I apologize to you as your father.
Su-hwan's heart is filled with bitterness, another bitterness of Su-hwan's soul. The girl in front of him, named Zhao Sheng, is a genius who came out of Qing Shan Town with Su-hwan, and was also enrolled as a student at the Wu Zong Academy.
Two of them are the blue and white bamboo horses, two are the little ones, and the golden girls are the fairy godmothers.
But, after entering the Wu Zong Academy, from the small village of Zhenxiang, she was shocked by the huge busy world and gradually became engrossed in the world of luxury.
She was a beautiful young woman, and her beauty was such that she was sought after by the young nobility and the brilliant genius.
At first, she was able to convince herself to stick with her intentions and spend the first year of school with Su-Hwan.
But, gradually, she understood the cruelty of the world, from a naive little girl, gradually degenerated, knowing that after Su Hwan there was hardly any future, and following her, it was likely to suffer and become inferior.
Finally, her inner defenses were loosened.
Two months ago, she broke off relations with Su-hwan completely and became the wife of Prince Yang's son, Prince Yang of the Small State.
Although she was a good girl, she never had sex with a man, but since then, the two often accompany each other, and they become the envious goddess in everyone's eyes.
Su-hwan, who became a laughingstock for the martial arts academy, was also a member of the group.
Su-hwan was beaten, and many times he begged Liu Shih-shan to change his mind, and despite his kneeling plea, his face was lost, but he was rejected by Liu Shih-shan's indifference.
Su-hwan couldn't bear the sadness of life, he threw himself into the lake, and it happened that Su-hwan of the Earth had an air crash, and the soul passed through him, the sad and poor weak person.
Su-hwan's father, Su-hwan, was a young man who did not know anything, his fault, I am willing to pay compensation, what you want, although mentioned, but, as a father, I hope you will be a full-fledged son, he is serious about his daughter, Su-hwan.
Hearing what the Duke of Qin said, Su Xuan shook his head in his heart, this trick, deceiving ordinary people, is useless to him.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to apologize for taking my girlfriend and making me perfect.
The post was originally published on the Chinese website of the People's Daily, where the post was posted.
Ask yourself, if the wife of the king, the wife of the emperor, is seen by his son, the prince of the country, would he dare to let the king give his wife to his mother? He would not dare, because he could not annoy the king, he could only annoy a commoner like Su Zhen.
Su-hwan shakes his head, wants to get up and leave, he has no intention of falling in love with a realistic girl like Yang She-sun, even if the Prince of Yang does not oppress people, he does not intend to fight for her.
As for the compensation that the Duke of Qin called, Su Zhuan, although lacking in resources for cultivation, although a poor boy, although he had nothing. However, he still had a will to lose, and he had not fallen to the point of being given away.
Liu Xiaoxiang understands Liu Sufu's character, he is stubborn and will not give up, he wants to leave, but when he still refuses to give up, the silver tooth bites lightly, the lily moves slowly, the snow is as cold as the moon: Liu Xiufu! Please respect my choice!
Since you have come today, I will say this completely, and I hope you will die.
The prince of a small country, who will be the pillar of the empire in the future, he can give me glory and wealth, you have given me a poor child from a mountain village?
You are the golden student, you will be the king of the saints, you are the king of the people, you are the king of the millions, can you give me security, you are the silver student, did you give it?
Zhao Su-hwan, accept the reality, I do not deny that you were my beloved, the brightest genius in my heart, but that was too young, too simple, the real world, cruel and true, I had no choice.
The last thread of the hat hangs, staring at Su-hwan's eyes, gradually distant, as if looking at a stranger, softly sighed: Yang-goku is very good, as long as you promise not to look for me in the future, he will do his best to compensate you, give you a few fusion budan, promote the improvement, you have improved your strength, will be much better in school days.
Thinking about it, she pulled out a palm-sized statue of a woman carved in crystal from her sleeve.
The crystal is translucent, shining with a brilliant depth. The most beautiful thing is the woman in the crystal statue, the beauty of the air, as beautiful as the fox, as beautiful as the fairy, as obsessive.
The statue was female, and was as alive as the person holding it, and was as bright as the sun, and as common as the others.
This is the gift you gave me, now, we owe you, we are not mutually indebted. The snow and the sun, the mercilessly put the statue in the hands of Su-hwan, turned back to the side of the wall, looking out, no longer looking at Su-hwan, cold and despair.
Why do you seek to kill me, O pond of water?
Zhang Zhou shouted loudly, thought to go ahead, and pressed the bed made of cast gold, and suddenly sat up.
The discovery was only a dream, but Zhang Zhaoqi took a long breath, wiping the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve.
No, they are not.
It was not a dream!
How could what happened to him and the Princess of the Pond be a dream?
Zhang Zhaoxian was the only son of the Qing Dynasty's Zhu Ming Emperor, and at the age of sixteen, he trained to the heavens with the opposite physique.
However, just as he was becoming the first of the younger generation of kung fu, he died at the hands of his fiancée, Princess Pichang of Qingmei.
Princess of the Pond, daughter of Emperor Liu Zhen of the Nine Kingdoms.
Ming and Qing were the best of the two, and Zhang Zhaoqi and Princess Pichang were married, and they grew up together and trained together.
A beautiful and handsome girl, a golden maiden, could have been a great story in the world of cultivation. Zhang Zhaoqi could not have expected that the Princess of the Pond would fight him!
After dying at the hands of the Princess of the Pond, Zhang Zhaoqi awakens to find himself eight hundred years later.
The former Princess of Pyeongchang, who ended the Nine Kingdoms' rebellion, united the Nine Kingdoms, established the First Central Empire, and became the Queen of Pyeongchang, the ruler of the entire Kunming region.
Eight hundred years ago, the Nine Emperors of the Qing Dynasty, known as the Qing Dynasty, were completely lost in the past, lost in the river of history.
The Emperor is dead, the Queen is in power.
In this age there is but one Empress, the Queen of the Pools, who rules the heavens, and is exalted above the heavens.
Why would she kill me?
How could her heart be so dull, or say that the heart of women is so dull? Yang Zhang Zhao's eyes were sharp, his heart was like iron, full of doubts. But no one could answer him.
Eight hundred years have passed, the sea of sand is gone, nothing is human, except for the queen of the pond, who is immortal, youth is still, does not age and does not die.
All the dead people have turned into yellow dust and turned into white bones. Even the nine emperors of that year, all of them died, leaving only a piece of mystery that will be passed on to future generations.
Whoa!
A woman of delicate body, in a beautiful palace dress, came in from outside, and sat on the bed, looking at the dust, with concerned eyes, "Dust, have you had another nightmare?"
This beautiful woman is the queen of the King of Yun Wu County and the daughter of Zhang Zhaoqi, Princess Lin.
The owner of this body, who was sick and sick, died in his bed three days ago.
After being killed by the Princess of the Pond, Zhang Zhaoqi came back to life and appeared in this body, bringing the young man who had died back to life.
It is more coincidental that the original owner of this body is also called Zhang Zhaoqi. Zhang Zhaoqi was very dismissive of Lin's wife when he first woke up.
After all, in Zhang Zhouqi's eyes, Princess Lin is just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Zhouqi gradually discovered that Princess Lin really cared about him, and it was no small thing, seeing Zhang Zhouqi's nightmares was frightened, and even more so, despite the cold, he immediately rushed to Zhang Zhouqi's room.
Zhang Zhaoqi never met his birth mother. It is said that she died when he was born!
He had no idea that he would be born again in this body after being killed by the Princess of the Pond, and that he would have another daughter to give him, and that he would feel the warmth of his mother's love.
If I had told her the truth, she would not have been able to withstand the devastating blow.
Zhang Zhaoqi looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes became soft, and he smiled slightly: "My dear girl, don't worry about me, it's just a dream".
Princess Lin, wearing a palm-colored hat and a red hat, sat on Zhang Zhao's bed, touched Zhang Zhao's forehead, worried: "It's been three nights, you're always scared by nightmares, every time you call the name of Zhao Zhao. Who is she?
It is not possible for Princess Lin to associate the name of the Great Pond with the Empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, the Queen of Qi united the Qing Dynasty and established the First Central Empire, and was named the Empress of Qi, the Holy Empress of Qi.
Zhang Zhou: It's okay, my dear, you heard wrong!
The Queen of the Jungle sighed and said, "You must never again say two words about the Jungle Jungle, even in your dreams, but it is the name of the Queen. It is a great disrespect to say the name of the Queen, and if it is heard by the right person, it will be executed".
Zhang Zhou nodded, pressed his fingers tightly, and said with deep thought: "Oh, no way!
From now on, I will be her nightmare.
The Princess Lin looked at the thin and pale Zhang Xiao, and breathed a sigh, but her heart was bitter.
Although born in the king's household, he was weak and sick from childhood, and was sixteen years old, and still only able to lie in bed all his years, lest this child also be like this.
Outside, there was a disorderly footsteps.
What are you doing?
A beautiful maid, trying to stop the eight princes from entering, was pushed lightly by the eight princes, falling more than ten meters away. The eight prince was a martial artist, trained to reach the end of the yellow extreme, a fist was enough to throw a 300-kilogram stone plate ten meters away, let alone a maid weighing only one hundred and ten kilograms.
The only thing that can blow her away is a finger.
The maid of honor screamed, fell heavily to the ground, and broke her left arm.
The eighth prince, dressed in a golden robe, with a jade belt around his waist, strong, with long arms, and a steady walk, entered the jade palace, coldly staring at the maid, and even a slave girl dared to cross the path of the prince, it was death.
The eight princes were followed by six guards in leather armor, tall and tall, with tiger-backed bears, who were clearly powerful martial artists and were the forbidden guards of the royal palace.
After hearing the commotion outside, Princess Lin calmed Zhang Zhaoqi's emotions, closed the door and walked out.
She looked at the eight princes standing outside, and slightly frowned, saying, "Eight princes, this is the Palace of the Yueyang, even if you are a prince, do not be disorderly".
The eighth prince, Zhang Ji, raised his head and looked at Princess Lin, and said loudly: "Queen Liu has ordered that the sleeping palace of Princess Lin and her nine brothers be moved to the Zhuangyuan Palace". The future owner of the Yueyuan Palace is the birth mother of this prince, Princess Liu.
The face of Princess Lin changed slightly, she had been expecting this day to come, but she hadn't expected it to come so soon.
The Queen of the Jungle laughed bitterly, "Is the Queen of the Jungle going to expel our mother from the Jungle Palace so soon?
My daughter said she wants to stay in the Yueyang Palace tonight. Please, Princess Lin, move to the back of the palace now!
The eighth prince smiled coldly and said something not at all polite: "Princess Zhu Lin, there are many poor people in this world, but not everyone is worthy of pity. Since the nine brothers are weak and sick, what are they doing in the world?"
He's your brother!
The door was suddenly pushed open behind her.
Zhang Zhaoqi's body was weak, and his hands were struggling to hold the doorpost, and he was staring at the eight princes not far away.
He seemed to have a weak body, but with a strong will, he said: "You don't have to beg them, we're moving now".
Why are you in bed, dust? It's cold outside, don't come back soon. Lady Liu Lin hurried up to hold Zhang Xiao Dust, afraid he would catch a cold.
The Princess Lin looked at Zhang Zhou's firm eyes, and seemed to be infected by his emotions, and her tears welled up in her eyes.
The Empress and the Senate, supported by Zhang Zhaoqi, walked out of the Yueyang Palace, except for the maid who was pushed out by the hand of the Eight Princes and broke her arm.
The other servants did not all follow them out of the Yueyang Palace. Everyone could see that the Princess and the Nine Princes were completely defeated and had no place in the county palace.
They were originally servants of the Yueyang Palace, but now the natural and wise choice was to stay in the Yueyang Palace, all to please the new master, the Eight Princes.
The Purple Palace, usually the residence of the lost queen, is very secluded, covered with leaves, and seems to have been uninhabited for a long time.
The night is dark and the wind is cold.
Sitting on a cold soap, Zhang Zhao, thin and covered in a coat, still felt cold.
The body of this body is too weak, and only by practicing martial arts can the body gradually become stronger.
Otherwise, even if I am the son of the county king, I can still be manipulated by people.
Eight hundred years have passed, and Zhang Xiaoqi doesn't know where he is going now?
Since God has arranged for him to be reborn in this body, he must be stronger, whether for future revenge against the Pond Queen or for the one who is doing everything to take care of his daughter. The humiliation and cold treatment he suffers today is entirely because he is too weak, unable to resist, unable to control his destiny, and even his place of residence is occupied by others.
To be respected by others, to have a warm and comfortable living environment, one must become a martial artist and prove one's ability.
In the world of kung fu, to become a martial artist, one must first open the Zhongshan Wu seal.
The so-called "Shangjian" is the qualification given by the gods to humans to practice martial arts.
Those who do not open the seal of the Yang God, will never be able to practice the true spirit, and cannot become the strongest among the heavens and the earth. Zhang Zhaoqi is sixteen years old, and still has not opened the seal of the Yang God.
If you are over 16, you miss the best age for martial arts, and even if you open the Jigoku-san-marker, you cannot have much success.
The same is true of the sons of the King of Yun Wu Shire. Why can the Eight Princes be equal to the people? Can they drive Zhang Zhaoqi and Princess Lin out of the Yueyang Palace?
Because, when Prince Otai was ten years old, he started the Wu-Tang Clan and is now a young martial artist in the late stages of the Yellow Zone.
If you let me open the seal of the god of fire, I can practice the nine days of the next imperial cycle.
With the wisdom of the Ninja Zen Buddhist scripture, even if I have missed the best years of training, it is still possible to catch up with other geniuses and become a martial artist again. The Ninja Zen Buddhist scripture is the supreme treasure of the Ninja Zen Buddhist scripture, and in addition to the Buddha, only Zhang Zhou knows the complete method of the Ninja Zen Buddhist scripture.
Tomorrow is the sacrifice ceremony, hoping to get the approval of the gods, and open the seal of the god of war.
Zhang Zhaoqi clenched his fist, eager to open the seal of the Wu-Tang Clan.
After Mrs. Lin had cleaned up the room, she came to my bed and put her hand on my shoulder. "If you want to rest, you should rest quickly. Tomorrow, you will go to the great sacrifice".
I'm sure I'll be able to open the seal of the Wu-Tang Clan tomorrow!
What a surprise!
Princess Lin looked at Zhang Xiaoxiu, her heart was filled with a sigh.
Chapter One
At the sound of a bell, a stained iron door was opened, and the echo of the iron door was echoed by the ancient buildings around it, and the sound was unrelenting.
After a dozen breaths, a young man with his head in a sling was dragged out of the iron gate by two prison guards with a rope. The young man with his head in a sling seemed to have no breath, and even his legs were thin and weak, and only bones remained. The ragged clothes with blood on them showed the kind of torture and abuse the young man had suffered.
The two guards threw the skinny man to the ground, raised some dust, and then stopped moving.
Shouldn't the child die? A short, fat prisoner asked a young man who was lying motionless on the ground.
Another prisoner shouted, "You should be dead, but whoever told him not to die, was disrespectful to Miss Jane". Now, however, not only was Ningfu destroyed, but he himself was freed, and should live.
"You old man, be careful what you say, we'll drag him out and deal with him first. " The fat, thin jailer suddenly warned.
Hearing the words of the fat man, the other prisoner, the old man, bent down to his own devices, and was about to pull the man who was already dead from the ground, ready to drag him away.
At this moment, a rather soft voice called out, "Oh, my two brothers, I want to take my husband away".
The two prison guards who were talking saw a woman standing on the side, dressed in a thick linen cloth, who, although wearing a thick linen cloth, could still see her vulgarity. The only regret was that her face was disfigured, covered by a slightly messy hair, making it impossible to look at her again.
The two guards recognized the woman, one of the only two living members of the Ning family.
Ning was the housekeeper of the Ning family, and when the Ning family was taken away, he left the house to go abroad for business, and so escaped the fate. And this woman was the concubine of the Ning family, and the wife of the thin man who had just been thrown out of prison, called Princess Ji-lo.
She escaped the massacre because she stayed in the Academy of the Two Stars of the Yang family. Of course, this is also because Princess Jianlu and the Ning family are not related. She married into the Ning family because the Ning family and the family were related, and she and the city of Ning were related.
Even so, the Empress of Ning was still welcomed into the court by the Emperor of Ning.
And he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he went, and he came, and he came, and he came, and he came, and he came, and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he came and he was and he was the first man that was first man that was first man that was first man that was born, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first man, and first
They were supposed to dispose of the bodies in Ningxia, but they didn't expect anyone to come and dispose of them, and they also gave silver coins, which is a good thing, they certainly wouldn't refuse.
When the princess heard this, she hurried to turn her back on Ningxia, and, speeding up, disappeared from the prison gate.
The other guard threw the silver coin in her hand and said in a judgmental tone.
No more nonsense, then Princess Zhilou is a good girl and a member of the Zhongming Academy, even if she is uglier, it is not our turn. The thin, fat jailer slapped the shoulder of the jailer who spoke, dragging him back into the iron gate.
The next moment, the little town of Ning reacted, he was backed by a woman, and the perfume was emitted from the woman behind him.
No, he remembers that after being rejected by Tamura, he was in a bad mood and ended up going the wrong way, and one of them went up to the tower. Then a yellow dragonfly scratched the sky and hit him, and then there was no more.
What! is it that he is not dead?
When he thought of this place, all kinds of information came into his mind, and he was reborn.
To the surprise of Ningxia, his newborn body was originally named Ningxia. He was surprised because his original name was also Ningxia.
It was only because he had a nightmare that he had seen himself in a very strange place, being imprisoned in a prison and then dying in agony. Although it was only a dream, Ning City still changed its name to Ning City.
He was born in Ning, but he didn't think to turn around, and he was born again in the environment of his dreams.
The woman behind him looked back and said nothing, as he tried to lift his hand to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead.
I'm sorry, I don't have the strength to walk. When I saw the woman look back at herself, she said something apologetic.
The Ning family is gone, you are lucky to be alive. This woman's calm voice, it seems that even if the Ning town is really dead, she is also this calm attitude.
He had just put together some fragmentary information. He should now call back to Ning, the only son of the Yang family.
When she was young, her parents went to the Mango Sea to look for ghosts, but they never returned. She has always lived with her mother in the capital of the state of Chule. Although the capital is large, there are not many people.
Of course, Ning became the first person in the Ning state, and Ning never cared about Ning. All the bad things that Ning did in the city of Chule, were borne by Ning.
One day, Ning City got into a fight that even he couldn't bear. He offended Yang Guo's family by putting the Pearl in the hands of Yang Junsuan, not to mention Yang Junsuan was not able to stand Ning's family, that is, Yang Junsuan's fiance Yang Yingyu, Ning's family was not able to stand either.
The result of his displeasure, of course, was that he was put in prison, and the Ning family was exhausted in order to protect him, exhausting his contacts and family money, but he was not protected, but instead took the entire Ning family. This news was learned by his predecessor from the mouth of the prison guard, and it can be said that the Ning family was also because he was killed.
After making these things clear, Ning Sheng sighed again, "This world is not fair, who has the big fist, who is the fair".
At the same time he also realized who was behind him, that the disgraced woman was his fiancée, called the Lady of the Gull, somewhat like the earthly child-mother.
Later, the family mysteriously collapsed, leaving only a disgraced Jianlu. But the Ningxia Empress still received Jianlu to the Ningxia family, and after preparing for the reunification of the city, she helped the two to marry.
He is not content with the fact that the original Ningxia is very dissatisfied with the discredited Princess Jianlu, often does not fight and scold, but in the case of Princess Jianlu, he will never contradict anything to the Ningxia. And unlike the Princess Jianlu, she has qualifications and can be cultivated.
He was also a member of the two-star academy of the House of Ning, and was already a monk of the three levels of the Confucian order. In the Kingdom of Chu, only those who can practice are called monks.
By this time, the Empress had taken him back to a very low black stone house. Although the black stone house is low, the area is not very small, at least there should be some. There is even a small courtyard with a deep well in the courtyard.
Even if it is about him, Ning must find out. Although he suspects that it is about the Yan family and the Yang family, he must ask questions.
Why do you ask me what you do? With one simple answer, Lady Zhi Luo let Ning down.
And when she had finished, she poured out another cup of fresh water on the city, and said, Let me boil water for thee, and wash thee; and thou hast forgotten some things, and knowest that it is not good for thee.
Ning-shih looked at the lady and did not ask any more, he understood what she meant. With his power, the more deaths he knew, the faster.
It is not known if the Empress added something to the water, but after drinking the water, the whole people regained some strength.
Sitting on an old wooden bench, he thinks of his current situation and his sister Ningyo-ran. At the same time, he does not understand why Tanmu-chan is treating him like that, according to his understanding of Tanmu-chan, Tanmu-chan is definitely not the kind of girl who is arrogant.
Chapter 1
Chu Chuan sails on the lake, the wind blows on the surface, refreshing the people.
The capital of the Yi Kingdom is a vast lake of ninety-nine islands, and the place he was going to is eighteen kilometers from the Imperial Palace and the East Garden.
On top of the small boat, he was of average height, wearing a blue shirt, and his appearance was ordinary but he had the spirit of a warrior, looking at the lake and the water, thinking far away.
Nineteen years, two months and three days, nineteen years, two months and three days!
A brilliant physicist, a bright student, a great scientist of the future, a small mistake in the experiment, an explosion later on in the world, reincarnated as a human again!
The sound of the bell broke his reflection, and he turned to see a golden shining whale that was bouncing around the boat.
Chu shook his head, bent down and threw the whale back into the lake. He stood up and a tower appeared in his eyes.
The 100 meter high building, shining with bronze, is heavy and solid, showing the dignity of the imperial palace.
The bronze tower is the Temple of Weapons!
In front of the temple, there is an open martial arts training ground, paved with red mud, where hundreds of people practice kung fu, or practice sword practice sword practice fist practice hand, or cut each other, enthusiastically.
Chu approached the boat, stepped on the martial arts training ground, and without taking a few steps, suddenly a handsome young man appeared, his face was like a crown, his eyebrows like swords, and his face was flying.
He was tall, he was tall from head to toe, and he looked at him with his shoulders down. "What are you doing here, you named Chu?"
Chu frowned: "Let go of me, you dog!
The young man, who is handsome, jokes: "Is it so hard for you to practice martial arts?"
Chu suddenly smiled and continued to walk forward: "Jing Zhou flew, I fell down and cried, do you believe that you can't eat and walk?"
The guard of the palace forbade private fighting, and did not allow suicide, and the guard of the palace divided the guard and the guard, one by one, both of them especially strictly prohibited private fighting, the light one was reduced, the heavy one was expelled from the palace.
Chu Chu is the untrained waiter, Zhou Feiyang is the eight-legged guard, the guard is a big fan of the waiter, he fell down and cried, Zhou Feiyang and the genius should be punished severely.
Zhou Liang raised his sword and frowned: "You, whose name is Zhou, go, it's enough to be shameless!
Choi Fei-yang took a step forward, his face was dark: "You, whose name is Chu, can only use these small means!"
Chu Chuan laughed: "I'll have to use a little trick to deal with a fool like you!"
He was staring at him with a deadly fear, his fist was tightening and tightening, and he was about to swing, but Chu Chu stared at him, trying to taste the taste.
Zhu Feiyang suddenly smiled brightly and waved his hand: "Wow, master sister!
A beautiful young woman, with a beautiful complexion, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a beautiful face, a
Chu's face changed slightly, and she entered the palace with them, beautiful, kind, and gentle, the kind of woman that all men would like to meet.
He came to me and said, "Young Master, you're not going to die".
Chu Xiao smelled her fragrance and smiled: "Miss, I haven't seen you for a long time".
He spent most of his time in the library since he was assigned to the East Garden, trying to change his fate with knowledge, rarely performing in the temple of weapons.
This time, I came to the temple to learn about the problems of the practice of the small shower pulse, and I wanted to see the secrets and practice notes related to the small shower pulse.
"Congratulations, Master Zhu, the East Garden is a beautiful place".
Chu Yi nodded with a smile: "You are very good".
East Garden belongs to the Three Misses of the Yucatan Island, only he and Li Wei serve, not only relax, but also have the opportunity to see the Three Misses, once the Three Misses are approved, the flying yellow panda is available.
Zhou Feiyang took a deep breath, this guy was lucky, he got into the East Garden, God forbid, he was not good enough to pick him up!
"Master, clean this mess up, I just practiced the sword-breaking technique yesterday, cut the sword".
I was surprised to see that he was not a good speaker.
"Oh, well, well, don't say that he's rubbish!" he laughed, wiping his eyes away. "Oh, even though he's rubbish!"
The eyes of the disgruntled woman are wide.
"I'm not going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to be able to do this, I'm going to do this".
I'm not sure what to do.
Chu Xiao extended his hand to surrender: "Master, come to the East Garden to play, the scenery is beautiful, and Li's cooking is excellent".
Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see? Oh, what can you see?
Zhou Feiyan, who was very handsome, turned red and laughed coldly, decided not to fight him.
Brother Choi, Brother Chu, Brother Choi, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu, Brother Chu Brother Chu, Brother Chu Brother Chu, Brother Chu Brother Chu, Brother Chu Brother Chu, Brother Chu Brother Chu, Brother Chu Brother Chu, Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu, Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu, Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu, Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu, Chu Brother Chu Brother Chu, Chu Brother Chu, Chu Brother Chu, Chu Brother Chu, Chu Brother Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu
Chu looked at her from a distance: "Miss, someone has a good skin bag, it takes a long time to see people's hearts, please don't trust people so easily!"
What do you mean, you're called Chu?
Chu ignored him, and laughed and hugged his fist.
He turned and walked away.
He was hurrying to follow, and as he approached, he suddenly reached out his hand without his mother's noticing.
He almost hit Chu in the face with his fists, and was so confident that Chu couldn't avoid him, he seemed to ignore him, but he was carrying his inner strength, and he was moving fast.
Chu was standing on one side of his head, his fingers flying over his cheeks, and he could feel the wind, the power of his hand.
Whoa!
The sound of a crisp, loud ringing in the ears.
Chu clapped his left hand on his face, crisp and loud, with little effort, loudly, and then quickly closed his hand.
He turned his head quickly. Chu remained as if the hand had not been struck in his face.
He looked at him with a gloomy look on his face. Chu smiled and touched his face: "You are a good martial artist, I admire you!"
Choi Jian stared at him deadly.
"I'm not going to let you go".
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Zhao Zhifei bites his teeth, his voice crawling out of his throat, coldly said: "I think that Master Chu won't care, right, Master Chu?"
Chu Chu turned around and laughed: "Master, it's over.
He looked at him with disgust, hurriedly hurried away, and then stayed, lest the two should fight.
Chu stared at her back without moving, touched her left face, and started the big round mirror to suppress the emotional fluctuations.
If it were not for the great circular wisdom, it would have been a foolish calculation.
The world is honored by Wu, from a young age, deeply planted in the heart of the idea, the mother is gentle and kind, knowingly and secretly protects herself, making him feel moved.
But as a man, he needs a woman to protect him, and as a man, he can't stand it!
He walked through the crowd of the martial arts arena and entered the temple.
He untied the wooden plate from his waist and handed it to the young man in front of the temple, whose eyes were like lightning, wiped his eyes and signaled that he could enter.
He walked slowly, stopped by chance, reached for a book, quickly turned it over, put it back, and walked on, stopped again, and turned it over.
One day, he turned over twenty-two books.
It was as if he had known where the books were, and had just pulled them out, but he was actually the first one to come, and the little pulse washer was in the library.
The whole of the palace was in his mind, every shelf, every book, with its name, its history, its history.
He walked to the second floor, went straight to the third row of bookshelves, pulled out the Book of the Broken Sword on the second floor, turned it over, and then pulled out the seven secrets, the cultivation mind of the Broken Sword.
When he left the temple, he had already memorized thirty secrets, twenty-two notes on the practice of the small shower, a list of broken swords, and seven broken swords for the practice of mind.
He sailed on the lake in a small boat, and the wind died down, and the fire of the bear's anger had died down.
The 30 secrets of the mind begin to merge.
At noon, the sun was scorching, and he sailed back to the East Garden.
The East Garden is a square island divided into a garden, each garden a rare flower, the whole island floats with a perfume.
There was only one small courtyard on the island, and the shade came from the door, and a large tree covered half the courtyard, and drove away the heat.
He entered the west room, and as soon as he had mentioned the sword of the frog, it came out, and waved slowly in the middle of the court, like a taiji sword, and for a moment a layer of sweat came out, and his forehead lit up.
He had seen and heard many secrets, and had learned many things from the martial arts school. The swordsmanship he had learned was amazing, but it was also very exhausting.
"Oh, wow... a young man with a big round face and small eyes came out of the gym.
He trembled like a black bear, stretched out his hips, and even groaned, until he spoke softly, "Brother, how long has it been since you've been back?"
Li Wei, the nine-character samurai, both of them are in charge of the East Garden, good taste, excellent cooking, good martial arts, but afraid of dying, they do not fight the nine-character building, so they are the samurai.
The state guards and bodyguards were paid ten times less than the average.
The guard is less paid, the class must be graduated, three years nine items, ten years eight items, twenty years seven items, forty years six items, seventy years five items. The guard is upgraded regardless of whether others only see the martial arts, the nine-class building, and the one-level upgraded one.
He was paid well, and was often able to go out to work, and lived in many ways, not as a servant who could only stay in the palace to serve people, but as a guard to all who could afford it.
Li Wei shook his neck, stretched his legs, and his joints made a series of thunderous sounds, followed by a fist-waving, which was like a meteor, breathing the air.
Brother, don't practice your sword, practice your fist with me!
Chu Chu spat out two words, and a layer of soy sweat fell from his forehead.
The world is full of martial arts, and martial arts are practiced from the very beginning.
After eight years to eighteen years, once the pulse is formed, the magical mind also works hard, it takes several times more time to build the foundation.
Before he was eighteen, he had been raised in the Akihito monastery and had learned the principles of the great wisdom. He had never been to Tsukiji. He was twice as clever as the common man and had a strong spirit.
He is a high-energy physicist, and his knowledge of the world is beyond compare.
He was a great sage, and he was able to practice the principles of the Great Wisdom, and he achieved the Great Mirror of Wisdom.
He is strong in spirit, his practice lasts longer than that of ordinary people, God is in his body, and he watches the light, so his pulse is fast, and in five years he can build the foundation.
Oh, what do you have to learn to use your sword?
Suddenly, Chu drew his sword and said, "Baby, baby, baby".
He sighed, and, being soft and limp, laid his sword down upon the ground, and then bent himself, and the sword was too exhausting to break.
1. Chapter 1
The sun was shining brightly in the old, old room.
This is the instinctive reaction of a good Special Forces soldier!
The hand fell, and the pain was electric, and I was helpless.
Ling Tian opened his eyes.
A soft female voice came to my ears.
He was looking at a delicate face, which was looking at him with concern.
This is a classic beauty, suffocating, and perfectly describing her in the style of a country dumpster.
Good morning, Chinese people.
He served in the most outstanding Special Operations Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and during his service, he did countless deeds.
He has participated in the World Class Special Forces Test, won the first individual award for single combat ability, and is recognized as the King of the Pigeons!
Later, during a cross-country SSS mission, a small personal mistake led to the death of a fellow soldier.
He was a self-inflicted wound, and he chose to retire and leave the Wolf's Tooth.
After retiring from the army, he spent some time in silence, choosing to go abroad and become a member of one of the most prestigious mercenary organizations in the world.
The success rate is 100% unprecedented!
He is a Chinese national who has been retired from the military for many years, but he still loves China.
As long as it is a mission that is not favorable to China, he not only does not take it, but also sends out the person who issued the mission, carrying out a brutal and inhumane massacre.
Over time, he has become a thorn in the side of all countries except China.
In the eyes of other countries, he is a time bomb.
However, as the murders of each of the assassins evaporate, the days of the living and the dead are ripening, and no one else dares to take on this deadly task.
Killing in the middle of the night is like killing yourself. This is a phrase that is recognized by the world's mercenaries and killers.
He has traveled the earth, and has never been in trouble.
Not long ago, Lin received a message from his most trusted agent.
The Chinese government is planning to use a colorless, tasteless, and biological weapon to carry out a horrific plot to smuggle it into China.
The government has not been able to stop the violence.
He did it!
The group of people who were arrested were also arrested by the police.
Just as he had cut a path through the blood and entered the underground laboratory to destroy the bio-chemical weapons, the underground laboratory suddenly collapsed, trapping him in a completely closed prison.
When you see an R-national with all kinds of weapons, you can see it in the light of day.
Betrayed by the person you trusted the most!
For by his wisdom the counsel of the nations is not made to fail.
The first day of the war, the soldiers were shot and killed, and the second day they were shot and killed.
Oh my God, what's wrong with you, don't scare her.
The voice was soft and full of anxiety.
He was absolutely sure he didn't know the woman.
But the woman's eyes now, as if looking at her parents, have no hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
The first thing I did was to write a letter to the editor of the newspaper, and I wrote it in the morning.
The sun was struck by lightning, and stood still, as if it had been pierced through.
The only thing that satisfies Ling Tiem is that this guy is also called Ling Tiem, full name is Yang Cheng Ling Tiem.
The video was posted on the social media site of the government.
Lee is the youngest son of the family.
Her mother, Li Zhuo, was the eldest of nine children in the Li family.
His father... in his memory, was not a father.
In the process of fusing this strange memory, Ling Tian also learned why Ling Tian was lying in bed with a serious injury.
This morning, the eldest son of the family, Li Zhen, called out the family as a "wild beast" that has no daughter.
But, he didn't even finish the body, how could he be the opponent of Li Zhen's double body, directly injured by Li Zhen, and died.
The first time I saw the video, I was in a state of shock.
He knew that from this moment on he would be integrated into this strange world as a member of the Gang of Heaven.
From this time on, he is the firstborn, and he is the firstborn.
Mrs. Yang, the owner of the house has sent for the medicine.
The sound of a voice came to my ears, and I looked up at the sky.
One of the monks rushed in from outside and handed Li Ju the exquisite box he was holding.
The box was opened.
Come, my dear, take the medicine, my daughter will cure you.
Li Zhuo took out a black and unforgettable decoction and handed it to Cheng Lingxiang's mouth.
The first thing I did was to take a deep breath and open my mouth to swallow the medicine.
The entrance of the dandelion was instantaneous, and the warmth of the flow entered his body.
The next day, I saw him again.
A cold air, which penetrated his body, opened the warmth of the medicine, and healed his wounds.
An hour later, Lee was killed.
The next day, she found that most of her aching pain had disappeared, and she was no longer burdened.
He just took the Sendai, didn't he?
At this time, Li Zhuo was found with a pale face and a sweaty forehead, which was obviously a huge amount of energy spent on his treatment.
Girl, are you okay?
The video was posted on the social media platform @sandals.
The girl's voice was sweet and sweet, and there was nothing unnatural about it.
It's okay, you can rest now.
Li Zhu smiled and shook his head.
The man who was the first to write this post was a man of the people, and he was not a man of the people.
He and the seven elders were still waiting in the prison. Half an hour later, he walked back into the room, and said softly.
"I'm going to tell the people who came to my family that I'll take care of this myself".
Li Zhu's face was so charming, so cold, and so empty.
Girl, what kind of medicine did you just give me, I feel my wound is almost healed.
She was lying on the bed, stretching her body slightly.
That's the eight-piece gold-plated dancing.
It turns out that even if the Li family in Qinjun Town had only two of the eight gold jewels, now one of them is used on his son with this foreign surname.
It is clear that his daughter is not inferior in the Lee family.
Oh my goodness, the host is waiting, we're going.
Li Zhou, who had been in the hospital for a long time, arrived at the courtyard of the Li family mansion.
This is where the Lee family executes their family law.
It was midday, the day was clear.
The prison was packed with people, all of them young and enthusiastic members of the Lee family.
In the courtyard, a young man was tied to a column, exposed to the sun, and two middle-aged men were standing beside him.
The elderly man in the cloak on the right, seeing the two children, was angry.
The day of the dead is here too... the eight gold items that the family has stored are just like the magic of the Danish medicine!
Li Zhen also, usually just bully a little bit of the overnight is counted, the nine elders would not say anything, but this time he had such a heavy hand, almost killed the overnight, the nine elders did not panic.
A Lee family member saw Lee Ju and Gang Lingjin arrive, and whispered.
Li Zhou, carrying a band of ling qi, walked to the middle-aged man on the left.
"Young man, today's incident, my son Li Zhen was wrong first, but now that your son is fine, my son has also been exposed to a morning, can you let him go?"
At this moment, the elder of the cloak, the seven elders of the Li family, Liu Lijian, was in a shadow.
Who knows, maybe Li Ju didn't have sex with him at all.
Instead, he brought a piece of paper to Li Yang, who was tied up.
O my God, how he hurt you in the morning, now you have to pay him fifteen times ten times all!
When she woke up, she found out that she had a very important problem.
Looking out through the gap in the corridor, the moon was hanging in the air, the stars were moving, and she was lying on the ground, being carried forward.
She was a little shaken, and could not help moving, but then she discovered a more important thing: she was naked! she was covered with a thin sheet of silk, which covered her from head to toe, and only one eye was exposed.
Her cold eyes fell on the two men who were carrying her.
Kung fu is strong, muscles are frozen, old samurai dressed, although carrying people walking silently, at first glance is practicing family, kung fu is not inferior to the appearance.
I was so sorry to see you with your fingers in your blanket!
She is the king of modern killers, cold and cruel, all over the world, but did not expect to encounter the secret plan of the most trusted man, the man named Longxi, her former teacher and doctor, she does not trust anyone, only believes him, even likes him, wants to marry him.
She was already dead, and hadn't thought to go to the king of the jungle for tea, but she came here by chance.
She was not sure what base she was on at the time.
She's through!
Through this body, it was wrapped like a donkey and carried to a magnificent temple.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The man above is handsome, twenty-seven or eight years old, with long hair and a green jade hat, spread on his shoulders, muscles are smooth, powerful in one-volume movements, his lips are thin, lightly touching a cold smile, and he is a cool, tough man.
Below is a childish girl, very young in appearance, with a clear face, and unlike the expression that the man enjoys, the little girl's face is pale, her lips are small, her neck is crying, she is crying, her hair is wet with cold sweat, and she is obviously suffering to the point of suffering.
This bastard, this strong youngster, who is he?
The two men, who were carrying the pigeon in, could not disturb the man's excitement, his movements were faster and more violent.
The little girl finally couldn't bear it, and cried a few times in silence, rolling her eyes, twisting her head, and not moving.
And he cried with a loud voice, and with a curse, and with a tumult of his body, and came down from her, and went up with his feet, and cast her down as a garbage-pot.
The girl was still, her face was turning yellow, and there was a line of blood on her lips. She didn't know whether she was alive or dead.
"He took the bread and gave it to the dogs, and it was well worth the money. " The man's voice was filled with rage and he was looking for something more.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff, is a small city in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in northern Arizona, on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, west of the nearby Phoenix, Las Vegas, and east of the famous Grand Canyon.
The United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, and Las Vegas are names many Chinese have heard of, but few people know that they are surrounded by the four regions in the middle of the flagship market.
Six months ago, Li Du was one of the few who hadn't been to the city until he came to study in Flagstaff.
Flagstaff is not well known in the country, nor in the United States, but there are some good universities, such as the University of Arizona, Flagstaff American College, and others.
The school where Li Du studied is called Flagstaff National Academy, and it is only one word different from Flagstaff American Academy, but that one word is a difference of a million!
Flagstaff American College is a branch of the American College, a private university that offers undergraduate, graduate, and pre-degree programs.
It's a wild university, and Li Du is a completely neglected graduate student.
As a result, his tuition and research funds were not paid for the first half of the year, the school was seized, the school board and admissions department were informed in advance, and a group of international students were expelled from the school by the police with a face full of anger.
Li Du was lucky, because the school accommodation was so messy, he did not have a dormitory to study, but instead rented an apartment room, and now there is a good place to stay.
But he's not doing much better than his classmates, and now that his rent is due at the end of January, he could end up on the streets if he doesn't pay it in time.
The sad thing is that he will lose his money!
Of course, he can borrow money from his parents and his friends in the country, but that is on the condition that he is studying abroad. Now that the school is banned, his graduate student will definitely not be able to study, where are the old parents who need money?
As Li Du sat with a sad face at the door of the small house, the pine door behind him was pushed open, and a blonde girl with dark eyes looked out and said, "Hey, Li, are you here?"
The girl was his landlady, Hannah Fox, and the house was left to her and her brother, Hans Fox, by her parents, who had died in a car accident.
However, Hans says that he has a big business to run, and he won't be staying for a few days at the end of the year, so the empty bedroom is rented by Hanna to generate income.
When she heard the greeting, Li Du stood up and said, "Oh, yes, Hannah, what's wrong?"
The girl smiled and a pear appeared on her pretty face: "I was just cleaning the fridge and saw some beer, it must have been left by Hans's guy".
She was carrying a half dozen or six bottles of beer, in a common wooden box with the distinctive Beverly Hills LOGO.
Li Du smiled at the beer, and said that there was only a small refrigerator in his apartment, which he opened every day, and that there was beer in it.
And with Hans' temper, if there was beer, he would not have stayed, the guy was a drunkard.
He was moved by the fact that Hannah had already offered him comfort several times after learning that their school had been seized.
But Hannah had little choice but to comfort him, either by sending him a motivational book or a beer.
The American girl had asked him about Chinese culture and learned the saying "drunkenness can cure a thousand worries". She thought that according to the Chinese character, drinking alcohol to sleep can alleviate worries, so she sent him beer several times.
Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness and owed her a favor. In American society, some gifts cannot be refused, otherwise it would be mistaken for refusing friendship, and he treasured his friendship with Hannah.
He took the box, and Hannah left with a smile, and before she left, she said: "You have a lot of problems in your life, but it's fine anyway".
After repeating the American proverb, Li Du opened the package to get a beer. But as soon as he opened the wooden box, a piece of amber-like crystal suddenly fell out, and the bar collapsed to the ground.
The crystal, about the size of his thumb, fell heavily on the concrete floor, and cracks appeared.
The reason for the guess that it was amber was that it was pale yellow, wrapped in a worm, and very similar to the amber he had seen in the sixth grade. At that time, their textbook had a text called amber mushrooms, and the language teacher brought them one when they went to class.
The crystal reminded him of some of the good times of his childhood, and he remembered that his teacher had said that amber bags with insects were precious. Unfortunately, this one had broken, which made him very sorry, otherwise he would not be allowed to sell it to pay for two months of living expenses.
The crystal was so badly broken that when he picked it up it had already broken, and the purple worms wrapped in it were exposed.
The worm is similar in appearance to a worm, about two centimeters long, oddly shaped, with a worm-like eyelid, but only two legs under the belly, with strange lines on the legs, and no wings on the back, looking clumsy.
Li Du, who had never seen the insect, raised his head strangely to see for himself.
At that moment, the most unusual thing happened: the claw of the worm suddenly moved, then quickly regained its strength, twisting its body and slipping out of his fingers.
He hadn't reacted yet, but the worm had jumped into his palm, and his head had fallen down, and it had been slowly, little by little, penetrating his hand!
Li Du was scared to pee, really!
He ran into the room, screaming and stumbling, and said, "Josh Hannah, call 911! Help me, I have a bug in my hand!"
I guess his screams were too loud, and Hannah came out with a panicked look: "What? What insect?
Li Du extended his hand to her and said, "This is my mother, this is my beloved insect!
Hannah was full of fear: "Where are the insects in your hands? Where are the insects in your heart?"
Not only is there a worm, but it is moving, and after it penetrates into the palm of Li Du's hand, it seems not to be lonely, it will go out again, and half of its body will be pierced.
Li Du pointed to the worm that was digging out, and said in horror: "Oh, this, this, this, purple worm, can't you see it?
And Lidu interrupted her, and said, "Hannah, I know what you mean, you think I'm crazy, but I'm not crazy, Hannah!
Oh, shit, the bug is out again!
And he cried with a loud voice, and the worms pierced his skin, and leaped upon the ground, and stood upon their feet, and walked upon the earth as a man walks.
The worm had no idea that it was going to land on the ground, so it landed on the ground.
Seeing this, Li Du Du Hai said: "That was so good, the bugs fell into the drain".
Subconsciously, he had this idea, what is in the drain, is there sewage that will drown the insect?
But then something happened that he couldn't believe!
Chapter One
The land of Shinjuku, the northern desert.
The snow and ice covered the whole earth, and the mountains and valleys were covered with silver cloths, and the snow and snow fell, and the sky and the sky were bright in the distance.
A group of merchants was taking a break on the road to the mountains, and the snow was so heavy that the carriage had difficulty walking, and had to wait for the snow to subside before starting the road.
Look at that, coffin-raiser!
The shout of a middle-aged man caught the attention of the whole business, and a group of people looked in the distance with a curious look, and their whole body trembled with a few glances!
The wind and snow whistled through the sky, the sky and the sky became a blur, and a mysterious golden coffin appeared in the distant mountains, gradually appearing in the eyes of everyone.
The golden coffin is two meters long, one meter wide and one meter high, and its walls are engraved with quaint patterns and symbols. The patterns and symbols emit a faint glow, isolating all the falling snowflakes to the outside, strange to the extreme.
Another thing that shocked the people was the dragging of the coffin in front of the old coffin.
It was a young man, who looked to be only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was naked, bent over, with two chains in his hands, and was pulling the coffin forward with his shoulders.
The snow and ice, young coffin!
The image is very visually striking, and captures the heart. The golden casket behind the shadow of the light, the young man's body is reflected in a somewhat vague way, the face is not clear, and the people are in a trance as if they saw a god pulling the coffin.
This young man is a natural god.
The middle-aged man shouted again, and many turned to God to weigh the boy carefully, to make sure that he had not shone any light of the facial energy, and again moved.
The usual casket of willow weighs three or four hundred kilograms, this ancient casket is generally made of gold, not to mention at least three thousand kilograms.
A boy without a forearm is not a real martial artist, even a strong strong man has only five or six hundred kilos of super strength. A boy can pull three thousand kilos of ancient coffins, although it seems a bit difficult, but it is surprising enough.
Young, handsome, and young, he came to carry the coffin, and this young man wanted to throw the whole life?
One elderly man was moved and many nodded in agreement. Although it is not common, it has happened occasionally in the history of the desert, and everyone knows about it.
The family of the Great Northern Desert, which had important ancestors, preferred to be buried in large gold coffins. These coffins were not buried underground, but were placed on the slopes of the iceberg, so that they could shelter the people of the tribe.
When the family declines or dies, the family holds a casket-raising ceremony to find a new iceberg to move the family's ancestral coffin, replace the wind, and promote the family's welfare.
This is the appearance of the coffin snatcher.
In many North American cultures, the air transport of the corpse is absorbed by the body in the coffin, and the body's energy and vitality are also absorbed, causing paralysis or pain for life.
So, casket pulling is the most despicable profession in the desert, even if the commission is higher, the younger warriors will not be moved, only the old warriors will pull the casket.
The young man is about 1.75 meters tall, broad shoulders, narrow waist, long legs, and frozen muscles. He wears an old-fashioned animal tooth on his neck, looks wild, and is not bad in terms of physical appearance.
He is 145, handsome, has a formidable body, and is not badly formed. But to do this most despicable and vile coffin-raping?
He was not afraid of losing his temper, his life was cut short, and he was going to be a wuss for the rest of his life. The middle-aged man looked at the golden old coffin and wiped his eyes a few times, then said: "It looks like the coffin of the ancestors of the Liu family".
The sound of the whistle, the people of the Willow family are coming. An old man suddenly spoke, and the whole company of merchants were in a hurry to shut up and look far away.
What a surprise!
A distant cry of a beast was heard, and a band of warriors in black armor, riding on silver wolves, came rushing, and before they could get near the wolf, the fierce breath of the wolf came to their faces.
The Silver Wolf Guard, the warriors of the House of Liu.
The people looked on in darkness, and for a thousand square kilometers around the whole city of Wuling, there was only one army riding on silver wolves, the most powerful silver wolf guard of the Liu family.
The Silver Wolf Guard stopped after catching up with the youth, and a middle-aged giant in the front with a long whip looked at the youth and said: "Get away, hurry up! If you do not reach the Black Wolf before dark, you will not get any reward".
The young man, known as Lu Yi, looked up, surrounded by a dozen giant silver wolves, one meter high and two meters long, he was not too afraid, he nodded: "Master, rest assured, I will surely reach before dark".
The giant Han drank a little, ran away with the Silver Wolf Guard, and soon disappeared in the distant mountains of the Great Wall.
Lu glanced at the caravan that had stopped nearby, and continued to silently pull the coffin. His hands grasped the cold iron chain, and he struggled forward with his shoulders, every step was extremely difficult, and his muscles were shaking.
What a load!
After a few miles, he came to a halt on a steep slope. He was exhausted and breathless, and sweating hot in such cold weather, it was hard to imagine how much physical effort he had expended.
He thought of resting for a while, and after placing the old coffin in order, he sat on a stone and took out fresh water and dried meat from a bag behind him, and swallowed with a big mouth to replenish his strength.
The plane was supposed to arrive before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat, he looked at the sky, his eyes soon became bright, and he said to himself: "A casket can be exchanged for a talcum powder, and I don't know if the Liu family's talcum powder is really legendary, one can add five hundred kilos of superpower?"
If I can really increase my 500kg strength, I now have 3000kg strength, and can reach 10,000kg strength by pulling a dozen coffins, then I can... wake up the blood vessels!
Look who else in the tribe is bullying their sisters? Oh, I'll have a good time with my sister soon.
Thinking of this, Lu's tired face glowed, and he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward, this time he walked more steadily and quickly.
The world is changing.
After a few miles, a voice came from behind, and Lu looked back, his face slightly puzzled.
The back is also a la-ban, but it is an old man. This old man holds the iron chain on his hand and shines a white light, and there is a white light on his feet.
The white light is the main force of the martial art. The power of the martial artists with the main force will increase a lot, the old man uses the main force, which is able to walk like a bird, easily pulling the ancient coffin.
The old man followed him up the hill, and he looked at him with a frown, and said, "Why do you drag the coffin, young man? It would ruin your luck".
Lu Yan smiled and said nothing, the old man looked at him for a few moments, stopped talking and quickly pulled the coffin away.
If you can't wake up the blood, what's the point? It's just a life of toil, daily bullying, and even sister suffering.
Oh no, this is not the life I want!
Thinking of this, Lu Yi's face became a little distorted, he growled, biting his teeth and quickly pulled the coffin forward.
The snow was getting bigger, the sky was getting darker, and the golden coffin scattered in the mountains was hidden, and it seemed strange and fascinating.
Chapter 001
You're going to go to work, you're going to write your homework at home, here's ten dollars, don't forget to go out to buy something to eat at noon.
In front of the door of a small cottage in a slum, Lu shook her head, and she was so happy to see her sister alive and well.
"I know, my brother, that little Lily is complaining, don't touch my hair, it's all upset with you".
My sister Lu Xin is very kind and helps her with the clothes and admonishes her like a little adult: "You must work hard, my brother will suffer, I am sure this time he will find a job".
Don't worry, your brother will find a good job, make a lot of money, let him enjoy a good day, and then he will hug his sister, adding in his heart, he will not lose his life because of lack of money, and tears will look at you a little bit.
When she grows up, she will earn a lot of money, and she will be a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money, and she will earn a lot of money.
But no matter how much she tried, she still said goodbye to her sister.
He was on the bus, and he put his hand in his pocket for a moment, but he couldn't help laughing.
It was a sad coincidence that the little guy who had just given his sister lunch money went back into his pocket.
In the 23rd century, technology has reached its limit, and all kinds of smart technologies are flooding every corner of the world, which has brought great improvements to people's lives, but also, in parallel, has reduced the need for human resources.
The unemployment is not a rare thing, especially for those at the bottom of the social ladder, and finding a stable job can be a luxury.
If it wasn't for the accident, he would have been unemployed forever.
He was not able to get into the game until he joined the gaming syndicate, but since the game was open for almost a year, he was too far behind the rankings to be considered a super-high achiever.
Two years later, her sister Lu Xin was found seriously ill during a medical examination at school.
With no money to pay for millions of dollars worth of treatment, he is hunted down by several unions throughout the game, and is left to watch his only loved one with pain as he grows weaker day by day.
The taste of the pain was more painful than cutting flesh with a knife, and Lu was crying and losing his voice after holding his sister more than once.
However, fate took a turn. The day she received the letter of terminally ill, Lu cried for a while and then fell asleep in front of her sister's bed. When she woke up, she was born again, three years ago.
While he was happy that his sister was still healthy, he knew that he had to earn money, and make a lot of money.
If she had the money, she could cure her sister's illness as soon as possible, and if she had the money, she could live the happy life that her countless peers deserve, who are such lovely little girls.
The rich are the ones who are proud, and they are not inferior to anyone!
In the end, Lu Yi found that even if he was born again, it would not be easy to become a rich man.
The only thing he can do is play the game, which he has been playing for over two years, and it looks like it will be only a few days before the game opens.
Lu Yi has given up on his dream of finding a job in the real world, and today he went straight to the headquarters of the Star and Moon Union, where he had worked in his previous life.
The Star and Moon Union is not the Big Ten, nor the Four Tops of China, it is just a gaming alliance of a group of college students, the heads of the union are very rich and wealthy second generation, so the development is also similar because they can spend money.
The most beautiful place of this generation is the Chin Lake neighborhood, located next to the university city, with water and flowers on the side of the mountain, office buildings in front and villas in the back, where only very wealthy people can set up a company.
The front desk beauty looked at Lu Hui's clothes with some disgust, dialed a series of numbers, and then informed Lu Hui that she could come in for an interview.
We are currently only recruiting for the death squad, the bettors are not, the recruiter is a girl, dressed in a new fashion, with nail polish on one side, and the head is not raised on the other side.
The so-called death squad is actually a pile of ashes, and it is normal to die a dozen times a day.
The reason why Lu Yi wanted to join a studio was to use the studio's game helmet for free, and the gambler, although he had no future, could at least upgrade, and the hard-to-upgrade cannonball was not what he wanted, and death in the game would be the experience.
What the hell, 20 gold! Nail polish was applied to her face, and the girl screamed like a cat that had been trampled.
Although the game is the most advanced virtual technology today, with the world's best design team, it is not confident enough to go to market without the inside, but the test content is relatively small, and it is a decentralized test, and it will not affect the normal game.
The most impressive thing about the test, which lasted only a few days, was that the gold coins were not very good, and there were too many places to spend money.
The average player is not able to make a lot of money in the first few days, and the experienced bettors are not able to make a few coins a day.
Some veteran professional players estimate that it would take at least a week or more to raise enough money to build a union, a hundred people to polish the right monsters, and to remove equipment and poison gas, despite the game's high cash flow before the third system update.
And this kid, he promised to give me $20 in a week!
20 gold coins, that's 200,000 copper coins.
I'm not sure if you've ever been to the inside, or if you've found a bug that can be used to print money?
The land laughed and remained silent, seeming to be immeasurably high and deep.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I can do it. I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I can do it.
After a few moments, I heard a rush of footsteps, turned around and saw that the land was a bit unexpected.
The people who came, besides the old and proud sword of Star Moon, actually followed several people, who had been in the Star Moon Union for two years before, most of whom knew, all of them were high-ranking members of the union.
Oh, don't tell me that the one who can make twenty gold coins a week is this little boy, the little boy who walks beside the sword of pride can't help crying, this person's name is half a cigarette, he is the captain of the brigade of thieves of the Star and Moon Union, he is a very hairy person.
I'm not sure if you can get twenty gold coins in a week, but it's definitely a game of the lightning-blade. I'm not sure if the face of the sword is very good looking, I had hoped for a line, but when I saw the look of the land, the line was gone.
Lu is a plain looking man, with a dark yellow face, a beige dress, and the marks of worn out lines in the corners of his body, which at first glance reveal him to be a man who is at the bottom of society.
You can't say that you have no excuse, even if you don't get you, it's not a big loss, is it? You face the vast airfield, the social elite behind the front, the tension of the bottom of the small person without any distinction, just a faint smile, and the calm look seems to be full of endless confidence.
Chapter One
Yamer, Yamer, you're all right, hurry up, we're going to class soon, this class is cold, you hurry up. A somewhat urgent voice rang in Yamer's ear, and Yamer had a very strange feeling.
The idiot, who was supposed to have been faceless, covered his face. Another voice rang in his ears, but Yamer woke up.
Yamer looked around a bit puzzled, not a single person he knew, all were strange faces.
When he saw the look of Yemer, he laughed loudly, and it was obvious that the laughter was directed at him, and the people around him seemed to be laughing at him, and he did not dare to ask a question, but he was careful to prevent anyone from touching him.
Looking at the classmate sitting next to him, it seemed that he was the only one who wasn't laughing at himself, but had just kindly pushed himself awake.
"Why is it like a school?" asked Yamer's subconscious, somewhat surprised.
The first time I saw this, I was surprised to see that it was a picture of a woman who was wearing a dress.
I see you are mad, Yummy, and Yummy can write love letters as well. You are fine in Yummy's house, now you are not a member of Yummy's house anymore, be careful in the future.
The table sighed, of course, did not believe that Yemer did not remember for a moment, just love the face. He did not recognize the reality, he was no longer the Yemer of the Yemer family.
The first moments of pain for Yemer, he remembers that he and Master Lo Shida were working on the Yuan Dan, then the swarm of the Western Gate came, and then the explosion and all the killing, remembering that Master held himself with a ruler, but how did he get here?
Yes, he is sitting here now, Master. Master is only three years older than him, and moreover, the reason why Solomon suddenly attacked them was because he was too beautiful, and the younger master of Solomon wanted to marry his beautiful master, and was refused by Master.
If the master falls into the hands of the West Gate, the consequences are unimaginable, and here, Yemer can no longer contain the inner panic, suddenly standing up.
What's the matter, don't you know that the class bell has been ringing? A young girl with a cold face, holding a few books, walked up to the platform, coldly sweeping the students who were laughing in the hall below, and the laughter suddenly stopped.
Everyone knows that this is the English teacher Yun Yi, the most annoying thing is that the students are upset, and once she is upset, there is absolutely no good fruit to eat. Yemer has felt something wrong with the chicken, although he understands the words, but the obvious language is not his original use, is this not the Lunar Continent?
However, after the death of his father, Yemer was completely expelled from the family, specifically because Yemer was not the Yemer's bloodline. More precisely, after the death of Yemer's father, Yemer's bloodline was re-identified once again, and was recognized as not the Yemer's bloodline, which led to the expulsion from the Yemen.
However, he also has a sister, Ye Chen, and a brother, Ye Zhen. He is not a mother, but a half-brother. Three years ago, his father seemed to know that he owed Ye Chen a debt, and he proposed to Ye Chen's older brother to marry Ning Chen.
The Ning family is certainly very willing to marry the Ye family, one of the top five families in China.
In a hospital examination, Yemer was diagnosed with a skin disease, and it was inhumane to admit it. Although the Yema family tried to hide the fact, it seemed that overnight the whole city of Beijing knew that the Yema family, one of the five major families in Hwaseong, had a skin disease, and the Yema family also lost a big face.
Oh, my...my memory was turned here, Yemer shouted, stood up, almost immediately took off his pants to see. He already understood that he could be reborn in a person with the same name as Yemer, but he couldn't be human, it was better to kill him.
What's your name, what's your name, what's your name, come to my office after class.
The rest of the class laughed and laughed, but one of the students went to the office, and it was only the English teacher who did it, so it was up to the students to decide whether they would go or not.
Although he doesn't know much about the inner workings of the family's struggle, there are some who know that he was probably kicked out of the family because he was a genius, not necessarily because he was not a member of the family, and who knows if he did a little bit of DNA testing.
It was not that he was being driven out of his house that worried him, he was not concerned about that at all, he was concerned about his own swan. Or what happened to his master, Lo Sheng.
But he also understood why his classmates were laughing, because his ex-girlfriend, Min Min, had been kicked out of Ye's family, and was still obsessed with pursuing the hottest girl in the class, Yan Yan. As a result, everyone posted their confession on the blackboard, then stood on the platform and looked at themselves with contempt and said:
Later, when the news of the affair was spread, he wanted to find a girlfriend because he was ashamed to face her, but he did not think that his daughter was so angry with him, and this passed away in a rush, and it was cheaper to rebirth.
I was born again in such a place. He could not understand a word of the beautiful teacher on the platform, he understood, and Yemer would not listen, for he was now a shy thing, he could not accept it at all. Instead of being born again, it was better not to be born again.
The university is no longer a big deal, the main thing is to figure out your current situation. His problem is related to the reputation of Ye family, although he was expelled from Ye family, but who knows if he will suddenly be killed?
After the class bell rang, Yemer's first act was not to go to the beauty teacher, but to rush out of the school, looking for a place to see if his pussy was really shy.
There are not many things to do near Ninghai University, but there are many small streets, so Yemer ran into a secluded little street and hurried to pull his pants down.
He is not a swan, but because the swan is too big, blocked by a blood vessel, causing this false swan situation.
But that's the way it is, with the current technology on earth, wanting to open up his blocked vein is undoubtedly a fool's dream, but it is difficult to convince Yemer, although he does not have the ability to open the blocked vein to make his own cock strong, but as soon as he reaches the third level of practice, this vein will be automatically flushed.
But Yamer immediately began to be disappointed, because in the face of such a thin atmosphere on Earth, to want to cultivate the three levels of the air, is undoubtedly a difficult task, perhaps he will not be able to achieve it in his lifetime, otherwise he is still equal to the swan.
Oh, you bandit... A woman's voice, definitely high-pitched, sounded in front of Yemer, who had just neglected to check his own cock, and forgot to check the surroundings. I didn't think this alley was connected, only the previous turn was not visible here.
Yamer is not a publicist, and he has no capital to publicise, so he's going to grab his socks and run.
"What about you, Yamer?" the woman asked in a surprised tone after screaming, clearly recognizing Yamer.
Chapter 1
The night is still, Qinghai city Qinghai high-end district.
Sitting quietly on a soft leather sofa, with a stack of papers in hand, looking out of the window at the swimming pool, full of loss and regret.
He is the leader of one of the four major game studios in Jinhai, the ruler of the Great Hall of Thousands, and the famous sword magician of Jinhai, but now he can only sit at home and drink.
Ten years of playing.
The first is the decade of bloodshed.
After enduring countless sufferings and tribulations, he finally led the Ghost Council, established ten major cities in the shadow of the Yangtze, and began to compete with the first-class council, enjoying endless glory.
Shifeng never thought that his ten years of hard work would be in vain, for the sake of the game, he gave up so much, and ended up being someone else's bridesmaid, all because he opposed the ghost and joined the super-communist world, less than the next day, the Blue Hwa Consortium gave him an answer, deleting his 200-degree sword king account that he spent ten years working hard to train, and going to the treasury to settle his salary.
He can only get five million credit points and a mansion, which is less than a tenth of the virtual kingdom of the Ten Great Cities, created by Sun Yat-sen.
Shifeng thought that he had paid so much for the shadow, so that the Blue Hwa Group became a big corporation, a lot of credit is his, but the result is like throwing garbage, throwing him away, for what the Blue Hwa Corporation did, he will surely take revenge.
I'm not going to do that, I'm not going to do that.
Shi Feng's eyes were filled with confidence and determination, and the documents in his hands were torn to shreds, and he immediately took a bottle of red wine from the table and poured a few drinks.
Even without the Sword King account, without the support of the team, the technology and knowledge in the game will not betray him. As long as the technology is still there, he can rise in the realm of the gods and again establish a virtual kingdom of his own.
In the morning, the sun was just rising.
The dripping!
The phone rings constantly.
The next morning, when I woke up, I was in a state of shock, and I couldn't help but pick up my phone from the bedside, and I was still hanging from the hangover from last night.
What's wrong?
I'm black, what else do you ask? We said we wanted to be professional players, but today is the day the school's ghost studio is recruiting people, haven't you always wanted to be a core member of the ghost?
The stone peak is a bit fuzzy.
How can you go to the shadow review after being fired by the Blue China Group?
Do you hear? They're going to test you at ten o'clock. You'll be late, you won't be able to come.
I'm not a black man, I'm a black man, don't joke, I just got fired by a ghost.
How much did you drink yesterday, Mr. Zhao? You haven't woken up yet, and the ghost hasn't invited anyone, so why are you fired? Well, come quickly.
The phone rang and I was in the middle of a conversation with him.
The man, who was not in a good mood, looked at his phone and found that the old phone was not his phone, but the latest version of the phone.
The room was less than 15 square meters, and it was cluttered with books on game strategies, and a notebook on the wall-corner desk, and a very old model, a large closet on the wall, with many clothes scattered, and a familiar face in the dressing room mirror.
The first time I saw this familiar face, I was startled.
She immediately got up and went to the mirror, and took pictures again and again, only to find that she had really become younger.
Yesterday I slept in a spacious luxury bedroom, now I wake up in this broken place and I am young again.
There are still some memories of this place, Shifeng. It was ten years ago, to rent a small house for the war in the temple area, lived for more than half a year, then spent some time in the temple area, and went to rent a large apartment-style house in the city.
He was born in a poor family, and his parents had to work hard to earn enough money to send him to college, and to pay for his education.
Shifeng was thinking about making money to change his home, but the streets were full of college students, and it was harder to find a good job than to get a job, so he thought of the most profitable virtual game, and in order to improve the game technology, he was determined to buy a virtual helmet, which has become a professional player's goal, and mastered the technology in virtual games.
At that time, he ate white noodles and bubble wrap every day to save money, and did not participate in every class reunion or fraternity, so he became a little transparent in the class, the boys looked down on, the girls looked away, every time he went to the supermarket to buy bubble wrap, his wallet had less than ten credit points, not even a credit point of ham sausage was worth buying, the businesswoman looked at the poor stone peak, recommended special price ham, the stone peak looked at the tempting ham, touched the wallet, or biting the teeth refused.
Who's playing with me?
Shifeng looked at the familiar scene and the younger self in the mirror, and shook his head in denial.
Even the most developed countries in the world don't have such a technology for re-aging children, who would joke with a decrepit uncle?
Shifeng looked at the time on his phone.
The 19th of April, 2129
I was born again, am I? The grief on the face of the stone peak was revealed, and the joke was made.
He remembers today as August 5, 2139, not April 2129 when he was in high school.
Shih-Feng shook his head, trying to sober up a bit, but still had a glimmer of hope in his heart, hoping that he would be reborn, really back to ten years ago, so he went to his computer desk and opened his laptop.
If the time on a mobile phone can be faked, then the news on the internet cannot be faked.
A few minutes later, I was online.
Shifeng was shocked, and all the information he looked up on the internet showed that today is indeed April 19, 2129 and even the official opening time of the Global Heat Shrine was written on the official website, which was very clear, the countdown was six days later on April 25.
I'm really back to ten years ago, am I? I'm still in tears as I watch the news from the shrine on the top of Mt.
The feeling of the people in the village is indescribable, with regrets, sorrow, and joy.
It was as if everything was a dream.
But the ringing of the windows and the cold air from the air conditioning reminded me that the Stone Peaks were real.
Looking at the family photos of his college days on his phone, Shifeng never noticed that his father had gray hair and his mother had wrinkles on her eye corners, they were really old and not as vibrant as before.
When he noticed his parents were getting old, a year and a half after the temple was opened, the high debt, overwork and stress had left them seriously ill, and if they were sick, it would take several million credit points to recover, but at that time, Shifeng was just a shadow captain, and the money he earned could not pay for such expensive expenses.
In order to raise money, Shifeng tried everything, but it was not enough, even though Shifeng tried everything to support himself, his parents left after a few months.
Who knows the pain and regret that he did not take care of his parents in his previous life?
Even though he later earned millions of credit points, this was a pain in his heart forever.
The first time I saw him, I was surprised that he hadn't been able to do anything, but he was really starting from scratch, and everything was back to the beginning.
Oh well, well, well, well. Now that I'm born again, I'm going to change all that, make enough money, cure my parents, and not let them work for a living.
Just as Shifeng was planning his future, the Negro called again, urging Shifeng to go to university to study.
But Shih Peek was determined to dress up and pack up before heading to the University of Kinghai.
He is familiar with the shadows.
Remember when he went to college, Blue Dragon, the big boy of the Blue Hwa Group, opened a ghost studio, and at the same time provided a lot of funds, organized the best students in Jinhai University, the War God Realm, when he also went to the examination, and became a core member, the black became an outsider member, and then he was happy for a long time.
Three years later, he became the head of the Ghost Studio, and the Blue Hwa Group became a major corporation in the temple, but was unexpectedly fired by the Blue Sea Dragon personally.
Now that he has been reborn, he also has an unparalleled advantage over the realm of the gods, and is naturally not ready to join the shadow, become someone else's tool, and make money for someone else, he has to go a different way, to fight for his life, no longer have to let his parents send living expenses, pay off all debts, so he has to start a business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and have a good day.
When he arrived at the first building, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned young man walking in the doorway, anxious to get out, and he was black.
You're here, Mr. Zhao Feng, it's good to be registered, there's no deadline, let's go in and register.
Stone Peak shook his head and said very seriously, "Hey, nigga, I'm not ready to go to Ghost, I'm going to open my own studio, are you coming?"
Black is in a virtual game, technology is good, then together with the sky, can be said to be brothers, in the days of the ghost work together, black although no game talent, but the management is very strong, the community of hundreds of thousands of wells managed well ordered, if there is the help of black, the goal will be further, but he will follow the choice of black, after all, he has nothing now, the black's home situation is not good, for life only decided to become a professional player, join the ghost life for a fee.
After a minute, the black man looked up at the rock.
You know how much a virtual helmet costs, don't you, Mr. Zhengfeng? It costs 8,000 credit points, a studio, at least six people, a workplace, salaries, etc. The start-up costs 78,000, and there is a lot of money to invest, but now you have that much money?
You are right, I don't even have the money to buy a virtual helmet for the realm of gods. Liu Shifeng nodded silently, admitting that even 7 or 80,000 people are less, as he said, remembering that the 100 people studios recruited by Blue Dragon spent more than 5 million, and later spent a lot to improve the quality and strength of the studios.
If that's the case, why do we have to risk going to the ghost? If it's not more stable, at least the ghost can provide a virtual helmet, otherwise we can't even play, let alone become a professional player.
He opened his hand and looked at him seriously, his face serious: "But I'm still going to open my own studio, I don't want to be restrained, are you here?"
The Stone Peak does not force the Negro, after all he has no security, nor can he reveal the secret of his rebirth, only hopes that the Negro will believe him.
The black people saw the seriousness of the stone mountain, and they felt that today's stone mountain was strange, too crazy, and it was impossible to make money in the virtual game before, we all know that, is there any way for stone mountain to make money in the temple? even if they make money after a few months, they don't have that much time to waste.
The black guy hesitated for half a day, biting his teeth, and finally answered: "Oh, I know, who made you the big brother, I opened the studio with you, but what about the virtual helmet, without a helmet we can't play the game?"
The tight brow of the stone peak suddenly relaxed, happily patted the shoulder of the black, laughing: "Oh, this is my good brother, the virtual helmet thing is reassuring, I remember the temple has a college student to try out a discount, every university has a place, as long as with a student card, you can get a virtual helmet free to try for ten days, let's go see it".
The black and brown face now turned iron gray, feeling the future is dark, why would you believe in the Stone Peak? Is it the kind of confidence and security that the Stone Peak?
What can you do in the temple for ten days?
Ten days later, I'm sure I'll miss the opportunity to recruit from the big studios, and I'm not going to buy a virtual helmet, but where will the money come from?
Even a team of professional players can't win 16,000 credits in 10 days of the opening of the temple!
Leave the money-making to me.
Shifeng patted Negu's shoulder and smiled confidently.
Ten days and 16,000 credits is crazy, but he has the courage of a reincarnated person, no matter what difficulties he faces, he will break one by one. And the opening of the temple is the beginning of his rise.
Then, Shifeng took the black man to try on the helmet, and bought all the money for convenience, put it on the computer table in the rented room, two whole boxes, enough food for more than ten days, and then handed over some things from the shrine, and quietly waited for the opening of the shrine.
On April 25, at 9 p.m., a few lights flashed in the dark and silent hut.
Shifeng lay quietly in bed, eyes closed, and gently pressed the start button on his helmet.
I'm here, my God.
I can't tell what it is, but it seems to penetrate my ears and soul, and it makes me want to throw up a few times in this cold, snowy night.
The cold north wind passeth through the midst of the heavens, and the snow-white rainstorm dances with the wind, and the branches of the willow-tree are broken to pieces, and the earth is covered with a layer, and the sight is far off; and the silver covering is laid upon the whole land.
It was not midnight, but twilight, but the paleness of the sky was like darkness, giving a feeling of a desert, as if pressed on the heart, breathing out. On that silver ground, a huge outline could be seen, a majestic city pool, as if a giant beast was threatening.
In the center of the pool, there was a high tower-like altar, shaped like a seven-cornered, all dark, straight into the clouds, standing in the snow of a violent storm, unmoving, in the sound of the hurricane that blew over the altar, the sound of such a crackling sound was scattered far away, with the original roughness, with no other intention.
The sound of the sands, which in this wind, break from the altar, as if mixed with the wind, some hidden things are not distinguished.
If there is hope, where is the hope? if there is no hope, why do I see it? The voice of the eagle, as if mad, almost hysterical, swirled around in nine days.
Below the altar, at this moment, there are countless figures in robes, standing there in silence, looking far away, hundreds of thousands of them, men and women, surrounding the altar, tightly packed, not moving, but with a fanatical appearance, like the man on the altar, in a word, they can give everything for it.
Snow, even more snow.
Oh, since you let me see, there must be hope, but where is the hope? The sound of the sand on the altar is bitter, full of sorrow, and long gone.
The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was blowing, the wind was the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the wind was the wind, the was the was the, the was the, the was the, the was the was the, the was the, the was the, the was
And it came to pass, that there was no more snow in the sky, but all the snow gathered together into one great snow-coloured dragon, which, when it was formed, immediately rose up, and made a great noise, and all that heard it were astonished, and their hearts trembled, as if torn by the noise.
A shocking rush of blood, which sprang from the dragon's body, soon filled his whole body, making the dragon like a blood dragon, its fierce shudder, struggling fiercely towards the sky, like a wild meteor directly in the sky, as if to blow the day a cave, open a hope.
The speed of its turn is endless, the whirlpool is whirling, as if the dragon had hit some invisible partition, the heavens and the earth shook, the sound of its roar spread in all directions, the blood dragon again cried terribly, and the body collapsed in layers with the speed visible to the naked eye.
At the moment when it was about to be completely shattered, hundreds of thousands of silent people below the altar, all with their hands clenched, biting their tongues, spat out a mouthful of blood, which blood seemed to be drawn by some force, and rushed up, as if a sea of blood rose up into the air, and went straight to the blood dragon in the collapse, and after merging with it, made the collapse of the dragon have a respite, and rushed to a higher horizon.
The blood dragon flew higher and higher, gathering everyone's eyes, but at that moment, the blood dragon was a violent tremor throughout the body, and after a loud crash that spread over tens of thousands of miles, it could not stop the collapse of the body, turned into countless bloody snowflakes, and fell down, and from a distance the sky and the earth were dyed red.
And at that moment, the moment the blood dragon collapsed, a sound came out of its mouth that was completely different from the sound of the great sea monster!
And there was an old man sitting in the midst of the altar, clothed in a purple robe, and wrinkled in his face, and full of spots of purple; and his eyes were dim, and his eyes were dim, and he was a blind man.
He had a complete spine in front of him, and a stone in his right hand resting on the thirteenth vertebrae.
His empty eyes gazed silently at the sky, and for a long, long, long time he sighed.
In his speech, the right hand of the stone, which had been moved again on the strange spine, rubbed the animal's bones, and made a sound of a cacophony, which spread far and wide, and his figure was distinctly Joseph, and with this sound mingled a sad loneliness and a sinking.
It was dark and gloomy, and the mountains were not quiet, and the wild beasts were not in the midst of them; and the mountains and rivers were shaken with a great noise, and the trees trembled, and the leaves fell.
And there was a roar of a beast, and the woodpecker shrank his neck, and the leaves fell from his body, and he looked upon the mountains in the darkness, and sighed in his heart, how different this place is from the earth.
Lin Yi sat under the tree, and several young men in front of him looked at him with contempt, and one of the fat guys even shouted at Lin Yi: "You are not allowed to eat dry food in the village by a foreigner, hurry up and go to work!"
Lin Yi came back to God, didn't say anything, slapped his ass, got up and walked away.
Behind him, the fat boy shouted, "You're worthless waste, no better than a child, throw him into the mountains for the wild animals to eat".
And the lion, his brother, who passes through the earth, what is his strength more than the strength of the beast?
This world of the monks is a world of monks.
The village of the wolves, though a small one in the mountains of the Yangtze, has no monks, but every villager is practicing martial arts and fighting, even women and children are no exception.
Only then can we survive in this world of savages and even the disappearance of ancient species.
Like now, although it is late at night, the young men of the village also go hunting in the mountains, and many of the prey are accustomed to going out at night, and although it is dangerous to go into the mountains at night, the harvest will be greater.
The villagers are used to this kind of life, and the children who stay in the village don't sleep, they gather together to play tricks and wait for their elders to return from the hunt.
The young children, who were dragging their nostrils clean, were playing with hundreds of pounds of stone locks as toys, while a group of teenagers were competing to see who could lift the giant stone weighing a thousand pounds.
The lion looked at the little herd, sighed, and compared himself to them, for he was indeed very wasteful.
But this doesn't make Lin Yi feel depressed, although he is sometimes talked about behind his back, but he still lives in the small mountain village called Wolf Village for a while by ignoring the fact. What really hurts him is that he has more than one thing on his mind.
The Supergrandfather system.
At first, Lin Feng was happy to think that crossing the border would be beneficial, but the first sentence of the system made him feel cold.
Main Line: The host of the game is a mountain-climber, who builds the first great temple in the world and becomes the first grandfather.
The mainline quest is divided into different stages, each stage must be completed within a limited time, and if the timeout is not completed, the host is directly eliminated!
Lin Yi looked at the systematic explanation, especially the last sentence, and the mother wiped out the host mother, remaining silent for half a day, and finally coughing out a few words from her teeth: "Oh, I bought a watch last year!"
After the anger, Lin Lin was helplessly reading the task, he was not prepared to risk challenging the system to see if the other party could kill him, the world hadn't even sat down yet, he didn't want to die again.
The main line of mission 1.0 is to receive four disciples of the family of the Shroud.
Mission statement: Even if it is a dissertation, want to inherit his clothes, also to receive disciples. The most important resource of a disciple, always people, is the gift of outstanding disciples to preach, the famous to high students, the famous to seek, the high students even more difficult to seek.
The mission is scheduled to last for one year, and if the mission is not completed, the host will be destroyed.
O you pit of the pit! the young lion sighed, and said, "This new man who has just come through is as tender as a fresh-mouthed little cabbage, and I should hurry to find a bull to be my master, and hug my thighs".
System brother you are so eager to give me the secret, that you should take the pupil, this poor fool, you ask me to teach the house what? Ignore and force?
What's worse is that the system says there are newbies gifts, but informs itself that the gift system has a malfunction, the newbies gifts are delayed, so that Lin Ming lamented that there are no newbies gifts, only more gifts.
The exchange system that was opened, instead, was full of all kinds of good things, like the Lindan Fabo, the Gong Fa Shinto, only you didn't think it, without him there was no goods.
The problem is that everything needs to be swapped for a point, and Lin Yi doesn't have a single swap point, so he can just go ahead and turn the system on its head.
The village was suddenly in turmoil, as if the hunting party had returned.
The young men who were waiting in the village were cheering as they headed for the village gate. Lin Yi glanced at them, but was shocked to see that the men who had returned from the hunt had returned empty-handed, without any prey, not even weapons.
For these villagers, weapons are a second life, and living in this mountain, without weapons, they cannot survive.
Lin Yi's mouth raised an imperceptible smile: "You seem to have a story".
Before he came near, he heard someone murmuring, 'The wolf was the hope of our village, and now the people of Stone Village are badly wounded, and there can be no peace.'
And the angel lifted up his eyes, and saw a young man sitting in the midst of the multitude, a man of great spirit, full of sores, and with cold rays of hatred in his eyes.
This is the genius that the Wolf Village people hang on their mouths. Lin Lin's eyes peeked, for this Wolf Wind, he is also known for a long time, the idol of the entire Wolf Village youth, is considered the hope of the village, today Lin Lin's first time to see the real man.
Although the wolf wind is wounded, the spirit is weak, but the spirit is full of blood, the physical strength is not comparable to the monk, but it is definitely the top among the secular martial artists.
According to the public opinion of the great world of Taoism, young people have this level, if they practice the practice of Taoism, they will also have a future, and the practitioner says that the end is to guide the spirit of the spirit of the spirit, to solidify the power of the Tao, to strengthen their own roots.
Lin Yi, who is not moving, tones his own super ancestor system, which contains a student's talent detector, and he is sure that he is pressing the Wolfwind key.
The object is too low-qualified to be a host's protégé
Lin Yi frowned, and said that the system was too demanding, and that he had planned to take four students at random, and then just throw the system's one-year deadline away, and then just throw the students out of the door.
But now it seems that it is not so easy to try to crack the system, even the talented youth known in the country and abroad as Wolfwind is not qualified enough, Lin Yi wants to gather four disciples to complete the system task, the difficulty is too great.
A year, a year... A year, a year... A year, a year... A year, a year... A year, a year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year...

A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year... A year...
An old man in the crowd, standing next to the wolf, grinned: "The wolf is my grandson, this is not the case, but not now".
The villagers often fight with each other, but Lin Yi is not interested in this, but two words from Zhao Sanbao's ear make him shake his heart slightly.
Lin Yi was grinding the treasure, when suddenly he heard someone from the crowd whisper curses: "You don't know how Stone Village raised such a little monster, not even four years old, a little doll, how can you defeat the genius of our village, what a demon!"
Her eyes suddenly lit up.
The first thing that happened was that the girl, who was less than four years old, beat the wolf in front of her.
Wolfwind already has some talent, and the man who hurt him is not even four years old, so what kind of gift is it?
The fat kid next to Lin Yi whispered, "Fuck you, you little bastard, you have to kill him!"
Looking at him, Lin Yi added: "Yes, yes, yes".
But he thought that this little doll might be recognized by the system. Thinking about this, Lin Yi didn't move his voice to leave the crowd, he now hated to fly to the village of Shih Tzu, but he didn't dare to go out alone, otherwise he would have to feed the beast in the mountains.
At that moment, the mechanical sticky note suddenly sounded in Lin's mind.
I'm not sure if you'll see the newly released gift packages right away.
After a moment, Lin was overjoyed, he had never thought that the dull system prompts were so delightful to listen to.
Lin Yi opened the gift bag and went to a quiet place.
Beginner Gift Pack: The host receives the basic training for the four levels of the practice period, a chance to win a prize, 300 points to exchange points, nine days of the Tao Te Ching, and nine days of the Tao Te Ching.
Lin Yi stood still, and a warm stream of water fell from his head down through his chest, and quickly opened a hidden hole in his body.
The body of man is hidden in twelve important cavities, which the monks call the Twelve Great Halls.
The practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of the practice of law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law law, land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land land
The fire of the fire-breathing body of the living creature is absorbed by the air of the outside world, which is circulated through the four openings.
Each cavity is like a universe of constellations in constant motion, the spirit is constantly transformed into the magic of the Linguini itself, as the universe flooded, evolving all living things in general.
Lin Yi felt his whole body become light, his mind moved, the magic power in the cave was like a fountain, the explosive power was moving.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the physical changes, and was relieved: He had a little self-preservation. But when he thought that the ultimate goal of the system was to build the first door in history, he wanted to become the first grandfather in history, Lin Feng was under a lot of pressure, and was busy checking the other things in the newly-made gift bag.
What is the chance of winning a prize? Liu Linhui saw that in addition to the exchange system, there is also a prize system in the auxiliary practice system, but it is gray, it is still in an inactive state, so it is not necessary to think about it for a while.
The only thing to hope for is that the 300 points of exchange will have a higher purchasing power.
While thinking about it, Lin Ming entered the exchange system, which had been a total mess, and he didn't dare to look at the price.
Looking at the price, Lin Yi cursed the system, saying that the lowest level of a bottle of spirits cost ten points to exchange, and a slightly spiritual iron sword cost thirty points.
Even if you want to get a basic head, a set of feathered crowns, you have to get fifty points.
The most basic of the arts, such as fireball, mind control and thunder, cost 100p.
As for those assholes with a string of zero-quality goods hanging behind them, Lin Ming didn't dare to look at them, for fear of tears.
Lin Yi looked at his mother's existing change points, counting the poor 300 in one tank, and shook his head: "Mother, there is too little money to start".
It's a good thing the novice gift bag has a book of Taoist secrets and a divine message, otherwise Lin Feng will really be blinded.
Daoism is the practice of the basics, mainly to raise the level, while Shintoism is a practical martial art or magic with many uses.
Surprisingly, the quality of the 9 tonnes of TNT in the gift box is so high that the current exchange system cannot even exchange it, and it must be upgraded to exchange it.
As for the system upgrade, it will only be available after Lin Feng completes a certain number of system tasks, which is still too early to say.
The Ninth Heavenly Ray of Reason is one of the most advanced Ray systems in the world of the Tiananmen, but it has been lost for many years, and the former practitioners of the Taoist system were all walking on the ground with this method.
According to the instructions, the new gift bag is a random method, which can be used to correct the nine-ton thunderstorm, and Lin Feng is considered to be the ancestor of the grave, 300 tons of exchange points, although the purchasing power is limited, but Lin Feng is sad and empty at this time.
If it wasn't for the damn main line, Lin Feng would have found a deserted place to practice his martial arts and then come out and kill everyone.
But now that I'm going to make disciples, it's a different story.
The first time I saw her, I was very disappointed, but she quickly adjusted her attitude and acted quickly.
After asking for directions to Ishimura, he quietly left without disturbing anyone.
The two villages are now in a state of hostility, and have become a refuge for the monks who are not afraid of the people of Wolf Village getting hurt, but are afraid of revealing their identities to the people of Stone Village.
Fortunately, now that the villagers were gathered at the village gate, because there was talk about the wounded werewolf, Lin Feng went around the village behind and nobody noticed his movements.
Lin Yi didn't hesitate to invest in 50 change points and start his own business.
How could the earthly Lin Lin not know that Buddhists want gold and people want clothes, and that to sell something, the propaganda and packaging must be done first?
Looking down at their feathered crown, white robes, wide sleeves, a fairy wind and fairy bones, the image of a noble person, Lin Lin's satisfied little bit of head, the system is expensive, but the quality of the sale is really nothing.
When Lin Yi arrived at the village gate, the first thing that came to his mind was a huge, half-cut, dead tree, with a trunk diameter of several meters, all black.
The tree was struck by lightning many years ago, and the old tree's huge crown and abundant life were destroyed, leaving only a section of tree trunk eight or nine meters high above the ground.
But just looking at the size of the existing trunks, one can imagine how big the trees were when they were alive.
The trees are dead, the ground is dark, and there is no sign of life.
At that moment, an old man came over and coughed and said: "Oh, this tree has been dead for ten years". He went to the tree and looked at it with his eyes up and down and said: "Oh, the little man is the village chief of this stone village, what can I do to help the village chief?"
Lin Yi smiled, and a breath of arrogance came out of his body, and he dressed himself up, dressed in a white robe, with wide sleeves and a crown of feathers, and looked absolutely unpretentious, absolutely unworldly.
The target is found by the monkey, which is suitable for the host's role as a messenger.
Lin Yi was about to speak when he heard the system's sudden warning sound, and he almost started to cry.
The elderly village chief, Ishimura, looked at Lin Yi with a strange look, but he was startled.
The only thing that I saw was the two eyes of the lion, which were green and glowing, like hungry wolves, howling at the mouth of the village.
In the village, a small, snow-white, sweet child, a jade carving, is trying to pull the tail of a big yellow dog, and the child's voice is crystal clear: "Oh, oh, oh, don't run!"
The system sounds in Lin's mind: The system of the talented is finished, the first target information is as follows:
The number of the bones is 10, the number of the intellect is 8, the number of the heart is 8, the number of the blessings is 8.
Summary: The goal is to have a high level of talent, and it is recommended that you earn money from the door, and teach carefully, and be a pillar of your religion.
Lin Yi didn't see anything else, but his eyes were fixed on the blood-red number behind the root bone, 10.
What does the number 10 mean?
For example, if someone runs 100 meters from the start to the finish, and the end is the same, this little guy starts from 90 meters!
No wonder, no wonder he was not four years old when the wolf wind blew his face full of peach blossoms.
At this time, I also found Lin Yi, a face that looked confused, with big eyes, and a ten-foot-long chin.
Lin's mouth is closed, this is not only a strong product, but also a super genius level of intellect, willpower, and luck.
Is it a bit stressful to be an apprentice and receive such a package?
Lin Lin was grinning, and a warm smile of sunlight was beginning to appear on his face.
If someone who knew Lin Yi in his past life had seen him smile like that, they would have run away from him.
Chapter 1
The morning sun, shining through the silver curtain, had just fallen on the bed, and her prickly eyes were barely open.
Last night at the party, she was happy to drink more, but then Lu Yan Yan picked her up.
Time sat up, the thin silk slipped, a red patch on the white sheets revealed, and on himself, the pale skin was covered with kiss marks.
This is the result of a night of pleasure.
I love you.
When he was in the mood for a kiss, his words moved people, as if they were still in their ears. The face of the time was covered with cherry blossoms, tears shy, turned around and looked at the circle.
What about the Lujyan?
Are you going to buy breakfast?
When the time came to put the blanket under the bed, and the legs touched the ground, she was weak and almost fell to the ground.
When the light came back, Lu Yan Yan also returned, slowly and unwillingly walking into the living room, his body was raised with a strong and oppressive air.
Time lifted its eyes, and fell into a deep pair of tears, and the eyes were silent as if they were a deep, unfathomable clarity.
The first time I had such an intimate relationship, I was always shy, and I couldn't bear to look at him with tears in my eyes.
In her delirium, she vaguely hears him say he has a surprise for her.
Is he going to propose to her?
The time is overwhelming, the heart is beating and racing.
As soon as she spoke, she was interrupted by a loud voice: "You're done! You're done!"
What did he just say, break up?
He's going to surprise her, or break up with her?
Is he just joking with her, or is he telling the truth, breaking up with her?
A voice, crying with pain, hidden in the throat, could not come out, half-sounded, and time only recovered its voice.
It's like a light, light, light, like a dust. You're breaking up, after we've had a relationship... What do you mean, Lu Yan Yan?
Lu Yan's indifferent expression, not a bit changed, "Last night, who called me to pick her up, and who hugged me to death to tell me not to stop, you also enjoyed last night".
Time is stopped by thunder!
She looked at the man who was so different from her memory, and could not help but shudder, and asked with difficulty three words: "Why?"
After that, she turned to look out the window, her mouth was wide and her smile was faint.
The smile that seemed to be a mockery in the old days.
The face of time was as white as snow, the pain came from the heart, the nerve endings were pressed to the limbs, the darkness fell on her, her fingers were pressed tightly against her palms, so that she did not let herself tremble.
The air suddenly became so cold and sticky that the person could not stand for a minute without getting chills and suffocation.
Time is running out.
Chapter 1
Rain country, the town of Linh, the moon over the middle of the sky.
It took Lin Lin a full ten seconds to finally confirm that he had indeed been reincarnated.
It is absolutely incredible that it takes a superhumanly powerful person ten seconds to confirm something, but it also proves how incredible it is that something happened to him.
He was the first to achieve unprecedented success in the martial arts, and his pioneering technique of three-fire guiding sparked a revolution in the world of martial arts. He was honored as the "Fudan Emperor".
But he is not satisfied, and wants to go further, reach the legendary void, break the void, become a god. To do this, he visits countless monuments, and finally enters the Black Blood Valley, where after many dangers he finds a mysterious tower.
Without disappointing him, the golden writing on the tower appeared, a work of no avail, called the Book of the Immortal, trained to the highest degree, the body is immortal, eternal with the heavens and the earth, and the sun and the moon.
Even though the martial arts are practiced in the coldest of the cold, it still seems that this book is difficult to understand, as if it were a book, and there is no head at all.
He forced himself to write down this practice, and while he was trying to study the Guta, the Guta was a light vibration, releasing an immense divine light, which instantly shattered his body. But what is strange is that his soul did not dissipate, falling into a state of waking and not waking, like a dream and not a dream, which lasted for tens of thousands of years.
For ten thousand years his soul has been searching the Book of Immortality, and he could do nothing but this. Ten thousand years later, he finally understood the first layer of this law of merit.
What is the concept of a powerful man who took 10,000 years to understand the first important level of a law of karma?
For the strong man of the heavenly realm, in general, lives less than a thousand years, and no one in the world can finish this book, because he has already died before the beginning.
But then, in this strange way, he has mastered the first level of the art of not being able to kill the dragon, and then he suddenly comes back to life, reincarnated in a sixteen-year-old boy with the same name as Lin Lin.
I'm alive, no matter what!
Although this body is only the second layer of the body of the body, waste material can not be recycled, but I used to be a strong man, standing on the top of the martial arts, and a master of dan dao, if the qualification is not enough to supplement with dan medicine, I do not believe that I can return to the top.
And besides, I can finally practice the book without destroying it, which is a no-brainer, even... maybe not from the universe, but from the mythical world, otherwise how could it take 10,000 years to understand the first great merit?
I have been given this life, and I have been given the kingdom of God.
What happened to this body, that it was only at the age of sixteen that it reached the second level of the martial arts, is it because the martial arts of today are too boring?
Hmmm, countless memories flooded into my mind, memories of another person, the original owner of the body, and in the process, two completely different people were also fused together, indistinguishable from each other.
I see.
Ling Chong nodded in his head, and said that the reason he is now a second-class alumnus is because his spiritual roots are too bad.
To become a martial artist, one must first have a spiritual root. With a spiritual root, one can absorb the spirits of the heavens and the earth, train oneself, and become one's own energy.
Some spirits absorb the spirit quickly, while others are slow, so the spirits are divided into four major grades of heaven and earth, each major grade is divided into three smaller grades, with the best of the heavenly upper grade and the worst of the yellow lower grade.
The key to judging the quality of the roots is purity, the purer the better, while the cold roots are five-line and complete, and the most messy, in the martial arts world this is the lowest ranking roots, counting as a yellow-class inferior can only be said to be a little difficult, so he is now sixteen years old but only trained to the second level of the gym, while his peers have reached the fourth and fifth levels of the gym.
The previous life of the Lingqing was the root of the heavenly, and the roots of the heavenly fire of the superior Kyungyang, plus the talent of the Tao that no one can reach, the Tao of the Tao, only took two hundred years to reach the heavenly realm, which is the record of the ancient people.
The five rows of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the root of the
Whoa!
Ling Chong was shocked, and his face showed an incredible expression of shock, he paused for a while, and with a strong soul force, he looked back at his own Ling Root in the field of Tan, and the shock instantly turned into ecstasy.
This is not five rows of mixed spirits, five rows of perfect balance, forming a lotus! This is five rows of chaos lotus, the most beautiful of the lotus, even rarer than the nine yang fire spirits, can be called the divine spirit root!
And I... I have a five-line T'ai Chi Ch'uan that matches the five-line Chaos Lotus!
If I live a hundred years, or even fifty years, I can reach the heavens again.
Rao is a man who has been in the heavenly realm before the death of the sun, but he cannot bear to show his happiness, because he is destined to be born, and the next day cannot be changed. In his previous life, he visited countless monuments to break the void of becoming a god, and received a large number of magic and magic, and the five-way heavenly magic is one of them.
In the first life he stood at the summit of the martial arts, in the next he will create new peaks and immortal legends.
How did your ex die?
The coldness of the night stirred his memory, and soon he showed his anger.
The former is the only son of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family
The problem with Ling Root is that since childhood, she was treated as waste material and had to eat her eyes out.
In order to give her son a bright future, Ling Dong-Wei and Huangyang Academy reach an agreement. Huangyang Academy will recruit Ling Ling-Wei as a disciple and train him with all its strength, and in exchange, Ling Dong-Wei will enter the Valley of the Purple Light to find something that was lost for Huangyang Academy a long time ago.
Huangyang Academy was founded by the Yuan Dynasty, and has countless resources. If it is fully developed, then the recycled materials can also be promoted to the state of the polyethylene.
The people at Kaohsiung Academy can't be idiots, how could they have offered such a generous offer if it was a good thing?
The valley of the purple light, the danger is heavy, the wrong step can be lost, but for the sake of his son, Ling Dongyu set out without hesitation seven days ago.
Yesterday, Huangyang Academy came and informed Ling family that today will be the appointment. But at this time, the senior director of Ling family, Lin Guanlong, ran over and negotiated with his predecessor, asking him to give this precious title to his grandson Ling Muyun.
The reason is that Ling Muyuan is a genius, his future is unlimited, and such an opportunity cannot be given to a waste material to waste.
The former naturally won't agree, this is his father's chance to change his life! But Lin Chien-Wen said that it was a negotiation, in fact, he was just informing the former, and did not take his opinion into account.
For the former is not able to bear the hand, and the greater is the stronger; a finger can crush him, and he is an adversary.
He was severely wounded by a punch, and then locked himself in his room, apparently not wanting to embarrass him in front of the Huangyang Academy people. By the time Ling Dong walked back, the tree was already in place.
The former is so disfigured that it dies with the disfigurement of the second.
What a cruel man, that his father had given up his life for this money, and that he was taken away by his brother.
This is a shameful, disgraceful, and unethical thing to do!
I can't wait!
He got up from the bed, and immediately felt a painful ache in his body. He was alive, but the wound was not going to heal.
The first blow to his forehead, the second blow to his forehead, the third blow to his forehead, the third blow to his forehead, the third blow to his forehead, the fourth blow to his forehead, the third blow to his forehead, the fourth blow to his forehead, the fourth blow to his forehead, the fourth blow to his forehead, the fifth blow to his forehead, the sixth blow to his forehead, the sixth blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the seventh blow to his forehead, the first blow to his forehead, the second blow to his forehead, the forehead is very pain, the healing is very pain, the healing is not working.
As far as I know, there are seven remedies to repair the root, but the four materials needed are too expensive, and it would be impossible to sell the whole family. And my root was only slightly injured, so it does not need such advanced remedies.
The remaining three types of yoga, two of which need to be refined into dan, are too poorly prepared for my current second layer of the body. Then only one of them chooses yoga meditation, only need to adjust the medicinal material in proportion, and cook it into a medicinal juice.
I'll heal the wound first, then I'll stop the bullying of my son, although I'm not rare in this position, but I can't let my father's chance to exchange his life for this cheap pair of unimpressive sons!
He kneels down, sits down, and starts running around.
This was the first time he had used this method, which might have been divine, but because it had been practiced for thousands of years, it was now too easy to use.
He was born with a very strong body, and his strength was greatly depleted, but he recovered quickly from his injuries.
The man was shot in the leg and the body was found in the street, but he was not found.
It is a shame that I did not destroy the book, I just started practicing and had such a strange effect. But this is completely different from other practices, the normal practice is to use the root of the spirit to transform the spirit of the universe into a force, not to destroy the book but just the opposite, to exercise the body and heal the wounds.
After practicing yoga to the highest level, immortality is not impossible. That's why yoga can be called the book! It's a pity that the current level is not enough, otherwise I can fix the soul root with the immortality of yoga.
Ling opened his eyes and looked out at the white sky outside, and said: "Now, we should go and surprise the old man who doesn't want to be seen for a while".
He put on his shoes, went to the door, and opened it.
Immediately, a tall figure appeared at the door, blocking his way, the man was called Zhang Long, one of the overweight walking dogs.
"You must stay in your room today". He laughed. "This man is a famous piece of scum, and in his eyes he is a joke".
He froze, and said, "Can you stop me?
You are the one who is blocking it, the director said, today you should not let Lin Lin go to the trouble, if necessary, you should eat a meal too! Zhang Yuan laughed without laughing and said: "This is the order of the director, and please don't make me trouble".
He was careful to keep the old dog, and he was not reassured by the fact that he was badly injured, and he sent a guard to the door, which also showed how important it was for him to get his grandson into Huangyang Academy. But when this hope was destroyed, he was disappointed and angry.
I'm not going to be able to get out of this, I'm going to be in a very cold place.
What a surprise!
Raising your hand in the cold is a sign of the past, cold and cold: "Oh, what are you, that you do not roll?"
What, he was slapped by a piece of scrap wood? Zhang Yu could not believe that he was touching his face, that the scrap wood dared to touch him, and hit him, which is the joke of the door?
What a surprise!
Then he waved his hand again and gave him a firm and firm slap.
What's that?
The sound of an acoustic sheep is echoing through the silent hills.
Li Li climbed the mountain for seven nights, the night wind was sharp and cold, but at this time he was anxious to be sweaty. He was thirteen years old, and climbed the mountain with his hands and feet and with the ground, and the night was particularly lonely and creepy.
Although the night looks scary, Li Zhiyuan's heart is burning inside.
Li Zhiyuan, who was born in a poor peasant family, started herding sheep at the age of seven.
Today, Li Zhiyi was shepherding his sheep as usual, but when he returned in the evening to herd them, he found that one sheep was missing, which made him very angry. He hurried back to the hill to look for it, but he searched the entire hill and did not find the sheep.
Thinking of the cruel deed of the landlord of Zhang Dahui, who lost a sheep, Li was burning with anxiety and fear for seven nights.
Now that the whole mountain had been searched, there was no shadow of the goat, at this time, Li Xiang thought of a place, only one place did not go to look for the Cave of the Shen!
Lifting his head to look at the night color of the valley ahead, like a wild beast, with his mouth open at all times to choose a person, and whispering in his ears, he heard the voice of the wolf crying, and looked at the night color of the lost cave of the demon, Li Li kept a cold for seven nights.
The Cave of the Fairies, a place of local notoriety, legend has it that a demon lives in it, and that anyone who enters it is devoured, and after entering, no one can ever come out alive.
But at this time, the sound of Zhang Dahu's whip was echoing in Li's ears, and he lost a goat, and Zhang Dahu would have pulled his skin!
Well, well, well, this eternal, immortal shadow is finally solved, only the soul is missing, today it is better to use your soul! You do not know how long, the Cave of the Devil sounded a deep, dark voice.
A moment later, a sudden sound of flapping wings was heard, and a strange bird like a crow flew out of the cave of the fairies.
Fly, fly, fly, this city will remember the grave with your soul, fly over the land of the dead, as long as the nine worlds are, this city must be found! In the cave of the dragon, the deep dark voice echoes.
After that, there was a shadow flying between heaven and earth, into the grave, into the city of the fairies, across the killing fields... not by himself, flying through the nine worlds, suffering all kinds of torments, and not dying for thousands of years.
Time passes, the ages change, one invincible figure rises, one giant falls. Slowly, without knowing when, a mysterious crow begins to appear, a mysterious crow escapes from its confinement and begins to seek the path to dominate its own destiny.
From the medicine god, to the fire god, to the blood god, to the moon god, to the sun god, to the ice god... and finally to the dragon king.
One generation of invincible giants rises, another generation of gods falls away, but, across the millennia, the crow still appears hidden in the river of time.
The cold wind is like a knife, the snow is flying.
The next moment, he saw himself sitting in a yellow-gray carriage, the carriage was moving a little, and there was a little girl talking softly.
Outside the car, there was a lot of noise. There were shouts, applause, and applause.
The man who was killed was a police officer.
He knew he was not going back, from an old oilman who died in a state enterprise, to a man who woke up after a drink and came to this world.
It's been five days now.
He sniffed his nose, and the air smelled of wine, cake, and fried fruit.
Oh, the white beer in the flower shop is getting better. The little voice of the maid in the carriage is getting better.
The face of a baby girl, and the head of a baby girl, are small.
The little girl, with her fat face and red face, wearing a green cotton shirt, was holding the hair rope she had tied for her hair as she was getting out of the car.
The rope is made from an expensive hybrid of bark and naturally has a faint fragrance, but the only drawback is that it hardens in cold weather and needs to be softened by hot hands.
The carriage stopped shortly after.
He drove off and walked down the gray and white streets, each one the size of a cheek-basin, covered with a piece of asphalt.
The street is full of people riding their horses and cars back and forth. The girls and women who are selling and selling their goods are not afraid to laugh and show their faces.
Lu Xing looked up at the wine cellar in front of him. The white sign was rectangular, with three large letters in the middle of the dragonfly dance: "Floral cellar".
Please come in! The room number "K" is reserved for you! A small smile came up.
The road ends, a group of rich boys make a party, from the small hand of the silver white paper fan, lightly, the window is open, on top of the painting of a mountain water smoke wave pattern, the mountain water is up and down, lightly overlapping, and there is a view is the title of everyone's style.
He was driving along the road with a small car and entered the wine bar.
The bar is divided into two floors, and the first floor hall is filled with people listening to the singing.
A green-clad girl, crisp and alive, stands in the void, her voice distorted, and beside her is a middle-aged woman playing a tambourine.
The song is a love triangle, and the three-part story is about the love between the general and the mountain fox.
Unfortunately, the barmen were rude, and only a few of the educated boys could understand, while the rest of the barmen ignored the two girls.
Lu Xing stopped to look at the first floor and was so excited that he also sought a seat on the first floor.
Who's the one who's going to tell the story? He asked without saying a word.
He is the ultimate VIP customer in this boutique, if this boutique is the equivalent of a high-end entertainment venue on earth.
The cost of such a service, in a small northern city like Kyushu, is already considered a top customer.
You are the boss. You are the boss.
When the governor had finished eating all the grain, he released him and said, "Go, sell this for a pittance".
He sat down carefully, and then, as he swept through the crowd on the first floor, he saw a pale, thin boy, dressed in a white robe, with a golden leaf in his hand, folding his handbag and swaying gently.
I guess I'm seeing the little girl singing again.
The last time the big man warned him, he was a bad guy!
He laughed and stopped talking. He started listening to the music.
A table of wine was quickly placed on a dark red wooden table, and Roo-Sung took a piece of meat and put it in his mouth.
A taste of white beer is like a drink. A light sweet sweet floral aroma is like a fruit juice.
The city is known for its ice, and the ice caves are thick with a variety of small, translucent creatures.
The ice cream is half the size of a regular frog, but it tastes amazing.
The price is also very expensive.
The average person can eat once a month, but that's a luxury.
When they eat the good food, drink the good wine, listen to the music of children, and think about other things.
He has been coming to this ancient Chinese-like world for so many days already. But according to his observations, there are many strange things in this world.
At first he thought he was back in the ancient world, but then he realized he wasn't.
The customs, the festival climate, are very different from any other dynastic region he has known.
The door of the wine cellar was opened again.
A row of men in short trousers came in and found a table near the corner to sit on.
The men were not local at first glance, but dressed more like those from the Central Highlands, with the temperament of the rough-hewn men from the North.
A man with a bald head, a copper earring, and a full face, but at the same time he sighed.
What is the big brother worried about, Li family village can't go through, we can take the second road, from the side of Zhang village, it is also possible to go around.
You know what, I came to meet you from the village of Zhang. The situation is similar to the village of Li family, many people died.
What's the matter, big brother? You said to tell the brothers to listen, and let us know.
I don't know exactly how, but I know that there are several fishing villages on the banks of the Yangyang Lake, and something has happened, as if there is a water ghost behind the water.
I'm not going to be able to do it.
The table of the winner was not far from them, and their conversation was heard without any cover-up.
He was a member of the church and was listening to what was being said. He did not realize that the people were talking about religious matters.
His family, which is one of the largest in the northern city, is rich and wealthy, but that's not saying much.
The richest billionaire on earth is the one with the least amount of wealth.
He was drinking and he heard a lot of rumors about demons and ghosts in the tavern, but mostly it was legendary stories.
This is the first time that I have had such a personal experience with these people.
The people who live there are not hiding anything.
The water-devil, I saw with my own eyes, was tall and tall, with a blue face and teeth, and a lot of grass on his body, and if it weren't for your older brother, I would run faster, and now you wouldn't want to see me. The light of his head was now too much.
Big brother, is there a water demon in this game?
I'm afraid Big Brother is not a story you made up, right?
Hearing this, Lu Xing laughed, and thought that this was another boasting bastard who had come out of nowhere.
And when they had eaten and drunk, he sent his servant to bring the tables of the songs of the singing women, and to look over them.
The three of them are very nice, but not in the right place, and he is going to change the song with a happy one.
What a surprise!
But at that moment, the bald man was red-faced, and he slapped the table.
The water-devil fell to the ground with a bone! This is what I stole and returned with!
He carefully took out a green stone from his arm, like a jade, and placed it on the table.
"I'm not a big fan of the idea of a big, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, and fat is the most commonly known example of all.
Is that a marzipan?
Brother, can you show me this toy?
Suddenly, a gentle voice came from the side.
The table was filled with green marble and the people were standing at the table with smiles.
And this is what the leper left behind. The leper was astonished.
He's the one who's taking the show out now, and he's going to throw it away for a while.
After all, this is not a game left by humans. If you really want to cause trouble, then you really have to pay for it.
I looked at it and saw that it was not a water spirit, but a gemstone, not like other gemstones.
The general variety of jade, which can be bought in shops and stalls everywhere, is the edge material of the gemstone, which is ground at will, and the price is extremely cheap.
But somehow, when he saw the ball, he felt something was wrong.
The white fox in blue, wearing a blue-yellow cap, and the black boots with silver threads.
The costumes alone can last for months in this garden, or even a year for the average household.
If you want to be a man, you can be a man, but if you don't want to be a man, you can't be a man.
He asked the little one to take out a silver coin or two and put it on the table.
The headmaster decided to take the jewel and go on his way.
But Lucius said nothing, and sent some men away, and took the stone in his hand, and took it up, and looked carefully.
He shook his head, a silver or two is nothing to him, according to the memory of this body, his monthly expenses on weekdays are at least two hundred silver or more. Occasionally more, it may even cost a thousand or two.
He was a very good man, but he was a very bad man.
With his jewels in hand, he left the wine-house without looking at the enthusiastic guests, but he walked on foot and walked towards the carriage waiting outside.
But when he had come out of the winepress, and was not yet halfway, he suddenly fell down and took the gallstone and put it in his hand.
And the stone was in his hand, and in the palm of his right hand, and it melted.
The original hard rock, in a matter of seconds, was converted into a dark green mucus, which was heard to cry in a low voice.
The whole mucus burst into green smoke, slowly dissipating in front of the road.
He stood in the same place, and looked up, and saw that the stone was in his hand, but the green part was gone, and he did not know when.
The image before him, standing there, a moment of continuous recollection.
The little boy was calling him over and over.
The way to God is better than the way to the world. The stone in your hand is just a common piece of pebble, not even a stone.
You're going home!
The two men got into the carriage, and the driver took a whip and smoked a few times, and the two black horses with long hair on their bodies slowly started to move.
In the car, Roo is silent, constantly looking at the pebbles in his hands. At this time, the boy also discovered the appearance of the stone.
The old man was once again deceived, and for a so-called antique wine cellar, he spent a thousand and two silver coins, and almost killed the old man. This time it was only one or two silver coins, and sometimes the younger brother ate for more than this money.
As the carriage was returning home, he heard a loud noise outside the gate.
I've heard that the water demons have been removed! A guide on a cruise has helped to solve the problem of the fishing village!
Is anyone coming to the court?
When he arrived early, he heard that even the city's governor's gate was almost sunk by the Oyuan catch. It was good to meet a cloud walker, who is said to have started the path, a flash of golden light, the water demon shouted when the warehouse was turned into green liquid, then exploded into a smoke.
Of course not!
He heard the officers at the gate talking.
He often passed by this gate, where the officers kept the soldiers informed, and where he liked to boast of strange things.
This is a coincidence... the road is better than the face.
And he remembered the stone, and was troubled.
The first of the two is the "Shinzhou Autumn of 1999", which is the year of the Chinese calendar.
The Qingzhou School Palace, the Holy Land of Qingzhou City, the noble nobility of Qingzhou City and more than half of the powerful members of the Zongmen family all left the Qingzhou School Palace. Therefore, the people of Qingzhou City are proud to be able to enter the school palace and study in the school palace.
However, it seems that not everyone has this realization. At this time, a teenager is sleeping on a table in a classroom in the Qingzhou School Palace.
The girl on the bench in the blue dress noticed this as well, and without a hint of anger on her face, she walked towards the sleeping boy.
Yi, 17, a student of Qingzhou Academy, a teacher of foreign students, looks beautiful, has a burning figure. In the classroom, a pair of eyes move with Yi's animated figure, even if she is angry, Yi's steps are still elegant.
This guy is sleeping in the classroom again. He seems to have noticed the sleepy figure, and there are many youngsters around who are speechless, obviously, this is not the first time.
What was the guy thinking, with the looks and body of the teacher, who was pleasing to look at, even?
Of all the lecturers, Bowie was by far the most popular, and none of them, for reasons that are clear to see, were given the goddess status by so many, and her lecture halls were always filled to capacity.
The young woman, who had been walking lightly and silently as she approached the boy, stood at the table, looking at the sleeping face in front of her, her beautiful countenance covered with cold.
A soft voice came from behind Ye Wo Tian, but it was not from Ye Wei's mouth.
It seemed as if someone was calling to himself in his sleep, and Ye Wo Tian's body was moving, his hands were on his head, his eyes were open, and under his eyes, the tears were the peaks of the ups and downs.
The voice of the young man was very light, as if he were speaking to himself, but in the quiet surroundings of the moment, it still seemed particularly strange, and for a moment, many eyes froze in the air, and then turned into anger.
How dare he... openly disrespect the teacher?
A series of angry eyes, like a sharp sword, made Ye Wo-shan shudder, as if feeling uncomfortable, his eyes moved upward along the seductive land, and then he saw a face as delicate as a pearl but full of anger.
Why is it that the black line on the cheeks of the leaves of the tree is so black?
He turned around and saw a virgin of fifteen years old staring at him with angry eyes.
Ye Wo Sun glanced at the girl, then cursed her, the damage was terrible, no wonder the size was wrong.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to explain.
He was interrupted by Yang Yiwu's indifference: "What was the background of the founding of the Qingdao Academy?"
It was obvious that Boyi was trying to avoid the embarrassment of the conversation, but Ye Wo Tian could clearly feel her anger, and even in a subtle way he could feel a sword, a sharp point, coming out of Boyi's body, piercing every inch of his skin.
Three hundred years ago, the Emperor of Tang united the Eastern Shin-gu, ordered the emperors to create the Wu-fu academy, the Shinsheng academy, and the Qingzhou academy was founded in this context. Yang Ye-wo-tan responded, of course, that what he said was recorded in the history of the Zhong family, and that there was another name in the wild history he saw in the family, however, that taboo name was never allowed to be mentioned.
What are the professions of yoga practitioners?
The practice of yoga can be divided into martial arts and magic, there are many professions such as warriors, knights, swordsmen, practitioners of yoga have many professions such as jurists, dan masters, alchemists, and jurists are divided into many schools, and of course there are also gifted outsiders martial arts and magic.
You seem to have missed a career.
The face of the boy revealed a sacred glow: the strongest profession recognized by the state of Qin Shi Huang, the patron of heaven, the divine magician, with the gift of the Lord, those rare talents, such as the summoner, the astrologer, the astrologer, the vast majority of them are from the divine magician, the divine magician can have a stronger talent than others, regardless of whether they practice martial arts.
All around everyone is interested in the gods, the mages of destiny, the legendary professions, the inheritance of destiny, and the care of the gods. Not only that, but even the mages of destiny are naturally suited to martial law and medicine.
I didn't think you knew that much about this.
Of course. Ye Wo Tian looked at Wei and said seriously: "I am a fortune teller".
A young man was drinking water, coughing heavily, and looking at Yeovil, as if he were an idiot.
Why is there such a brazen person in the world, a legendary figure in the Qingzhou Academy, who not only openly mocks the teacher, but now also lies about being a fortune teller to attract the attention of the teacher?
But what is he, who, after three years of study in the palace, has been awake and breathing in the first place, with a weak body, and an apparently unfinished physique, so mediocre and even a waste of wood, that he calls himself a fortune teller?
Bowie's chest bounced again, and she looked at Yeo Wo-sun in anger: "Since you are the divine judge, the nature of the soul has a soul, release your soul of the soul of the soul so that I can see".
My soul is still asleep, I can't wake up, I fell asleep in the pulpit because of my soul.
Liu Ye Wo Tian... Liu suddenly shouted, and the dead girl stared at the boy in front of her, saying: "Oh, three years ago, when you were twelve years old, I was a student at the outdoor school, and visited your talent test, you were a gift to the spirit, shocked the school, many teachers were concerned, but after three years, there was no progress, always stayed awake for the first time, nothing to do, lazy, absent-minded in the class, did you not practice?
You have been refusing all the exams for three years, whether it is Spring or Autumn, and you have been ranked first in the direct list of the school, Ye Wo Sun, do you have any shame?
The whole school became silent as Bo Yi's anger was stirred, and the eyes of many people were fixed on Bo Yi's excited expression, as if they had never seen her before.
Ye Wo Tian seemed to be in a state of shock, too, as the dark monkeys stared at the delicate faces that were blushing with anger.
It's been three years. Wu Ye Wo whispered in his heart, without thinking or knowing that three years have passed, and the guy in the court of life, still has not changed a bit, and he is somewhat unexpected, the always indifferent ice mountain sensual goddess, the teacher, has been watching him, since the year he entered the court of learning to detect the gift of perception has already begun.
The space is dead, the young man stares at the young man, the handsome face with clear lines, the clean, deep eyes of the young star, the fifteen-year-old, apart from the thin figure, can not pick out other problems, in three or two years, he must be a beautiful man.
Was my tone too heavy? When Yang Yi saw that Ye Wo Tian's eyes were a few drops of anger, he did not hesitate to say it in his heart, and his anger also dissipated a few minutes.
You have one more month to go to the autumn exam, and if you still refuse or fail this time, even if the rest of your life is not for you, the school will not allow you to stay, do you not understand?
If so, it will probably be included in the history of the Qingzhou Academy, after all, it is rare for a Qingzhou Academy to be expelled.
Let him go, I'll go. At the end, a faint voice came, and many looked at the boy sitting in the corner, his eyes were complex, with envy, jealousy, and also adoration and fear.
It has been decided in the Palace of the Dragon that the rest of his life does not have to participate in the Spring Festival next year, and can choose any palace in the Palace of the Dragon, the Order of the Knights, and the Palace of the Magic, his future can no longer be bored by you. Yang Yi looked at Yevgeny and sighed, and his fate and the fate of the rest of his life will eventually go in completely different directions.
The first time I saw him, I was surprised to see him smile, and I was surprised to see him smile.
The eyes pierced the sharp light of the lamp, piercing the eye of the tiger.
He sat down. He did not turn his head, but said it lightly, and for the rest of his life he stared at the shadow in front of him, then sat down quietly, as if the words of Ye Wo Tian were iron commands to him.
I decided to........I decided to put a slightly mad smile on my face and look at Aiido: You are officially taking the Autumn Exams this year.
Afterwards, a bright light flashed through the tears of the rest of my life.
Three years, he finally, seriously?
After three years of practice in the Qingzhou Academy, everyone in the Academy only knew that he had a brilliant talent for the rest of his life, a perceptive talent with the characteristics of the Golden System, a martial talent that was also high, and a master of martial arts and martial arts, although he was a student of the outer door, the level was higher than many lecturers.
However, who really knows the sleeping boy?
You are weak, and you are still in the first stage of awakening, how can you survive even if you take the Autumn Exam? You are still too late to get up, even if you are still awake.
What if it's over? Yang Ye-wo-tan seems a little unconfident, with a strong confidence in his tone.
If you can, do whatever you want in the lecture hall.
Ye Wo's eyes flashed with a strange glow, looking at the shadow and the torch in front of him, his eyes did not look where they should not look, weakly: "Do you want to do anything?"
What does this mean, man... many people are staring at the sky.
Where did this shameless bastard look? He seemed to notice Yevoth's eyes, many people had the impulse to go wild, how dare he make fun of his teacher?
Bowie naturally noticed Yeo's eyes, and his newfound compassion was gone for a moment, as the beautiful and evil girl stared at Yeo, biting her teeth and saying, "You can do whatever you want!
Deep in the mountains, all the demons gathered.
For the first time, the tribes abandoned their grudges and appeared together, the tiger, the fox, the snake... all kinds of demons were gathered. At one time, the whole forest was the sound of all kinds of demons, big or small, or soft or fairy.
Hey, you elves, what happened recently here, I think you have a number of hearts. Hey, the tiger tribe has always been strong, the first thing the tiger king said was to make all the demons quiet down, hey, we are fellow elves, under such a crisis, I think that all the tribes should abandon the stereotypes, unite and solve the problems at hand together.
Why the clamour?
And did you guess that? The King of the Tigers frowned, and said, Who but the three monks of the six orders could do such a thing? Were we slaughtered by fewer demons in all these years?
But we have always been at odds with these sorcerers, and why they suddenly prevented us from going out of the world. The Fox King was in doubt.
The dragon did not eat the first of their three-six generations. The dragon king also guessed that the dragon did not have to tear their faces like this.
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Oh yeah, everyone knows that our demons are harmful to them, so they never go near the border forest, how can they be here for their own special purpose?
But... who, except for the Three of Hexes, has the strength to kill all the demons in the world in three months?
The King of the Monkeys nodded as if he was remembering something, and all his feathers were frightened, and I heard that the demons that had come out of the world, one by one, had died, and that the dead bodies of the dead had been skinned, and that the dead bodies of the dead were dried by the wind on the old trees in the forest.
The king of the tigers smashed the hand of the stone chair, and in a rage rose up, and said, "Devils, I think it would be better to kill each other to find out who is behind this speculation". I do not believe that they can build higher and can still hold this huge army of demons.
As soon as he said that, the other nine demon lords immediately showed an expression of approval, and indeed, instead of being afraid, they took the initiative to attack.
The first response of the Deer King was, "My son will die in their hands, so instead of guessing here, it's better to go out and kill someone quickly".
Is it not for this that we are gathered here today? Whoever he is, let him go out and avenge the death of his kind. Even the least daring king of the Yangs stands up in response, but the Yangs are the most dead.
No, this is not revenge, it's just a demon!
The spirit of the Yang people is upon us, and we will avenge this.
The other demon-kings also rose up in response, and even the four surrounding demons of all nations, who were also in their present form, with bright claws, excitedly shouted the slogan of revenge, suddenly a whole army was on the march.
A small voice suddenly rang out in the crowd, "I don't think I need to go".
In the midst of the crowd's fury, a voice of opposition suddenly appeared, which, though not loud, succeeded in attracting the attention of the demons. The shouting stopped, and all the demons' eyes were fixed on the thorns.
Who is the tiger? The tiger king is a tiger, looking for this kind of demon that has no seed.
The demons searched everywhere, and it was clear that the five senses were the most acute, but after half a day of searching they could not find the person who spoke.
Who is this that speaks? The king of the tigers has a temper, where did the dragon come from? There is a kind of king who stands out for the king.
I'm here, I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here!
The demons looked around again and again, and still they could not see who was speaking.
Here, here, here... Here, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there, there
They looked around for a while, but did not find anyone.
Oh, here I am!
And when he had cried out, a figure appeared, which was as one of the angels, and ascended on the seat of the Lord of spirits. And the spirits saw the man who had spoken.
It was a woman dressed in a gray robe, her shoulders were weak, her eyes were dragging and dragging, and the whole crowd was covered with a sort of melancholy temperament, her figure was short and thin, and her face was a little yellow.
And a word came out of the demon's head, and it was very weak, and the spirit of the demon was weak, and pitied her, as though a spirit of the devil could blow her away with a breath of air.
It's no wonder that the demons have been looking for him for half a day and haven't found him, such a demon is really unremarkable.
The bloody tiger king could not look past it, the tiger nose sprayed, the way of the tiger, oh, you are a child without seed, a few monks in the district scared you, and turned into this kind of image. Oh, all the demons can change shape, but this is the All-Demons Conference, so here most of the fairies have revealed the prototype to distinguish the race, only she maintains the complete human form, which makes the tiger king more blind, I dare not show the original human form, what kind of demon are you?
"I am a human being", the woman replied.
What is a dragon? The dragon king asked, "What is a dragon?" I had never heard of it!
What kind of a messy weak little demon dares to come to the Demon Assembly. The Tiger King looked at the woman with anger and displeasure, "You are a no-nonsense little demon, rest here in this nonsense, affect my morale to wait for revenge".
No, I'm serious. The girl raised her hand without remorse, but her shoulders didn't feel lowered, they looked weaker. You don't have to go out and get revenge.
The tiger king was angry and shouted, "You don't believe I ate your little demon".
You ate me, so you don't have to run around all day?
What do you mean?
I mean, the guy you were talking about, the guy who killed demons, who was no better than birds... She sighed, patted the gray robe, looked up, still the same, but pointed to her nose, "Oh, maybe... it's me!"
The whole place was silent for three seconds, and the birds were silent.
I killed her!
The demon, who had been reacting, also walked towards the woman.
What a pain in the ass for a small animal!
Five minutes later, the video was uploaded to YouTube.
The first and last All-Demon Congress of the Yangtze River Valley has ended!
Chapter One: Tony and Dawn?
The enormous noise stimulates the nerves of the brain, and the loudest sounds can deafen the ear. A stinging white light shines into the eyelids, and the sun ** drums make painful.
Don's eyes were opened, but the light did not go out, it spread all over the world.
What the fuck is going on? Am I standing in front of a rock concert?
Downes opened his eyes in his heart, cursing, and a large, frightening face rushed into his eyes. A sweaty, black face, the heat from the two black holes under the wide nostrils seemed to have been sprayed on his face. The white teeth in the gaping mouth were as frightening as wild animals, and of course the smell of the mouth.
The next blow was a strong, positive one. Dawn felt as if she had been punched in the jaw, and the whole body had fallen backwards.
The weight of the two men on the poor plastic bottles, which were overwhelmed, announced the disintegration. Water from the white flowers splashed out, and even a column of water shot from the mouth of one of the bottles, directly into the face of the back of the aquarium fish, while the other aquarium fish jumped up as if they were surprised sparrows.
What the hell!
What a fucking asshole!
What's going on?
The doctor, the doctor!
How did you get it?
Down lay on the ground, looking dumbfounded at the strange faces around him, some of them anxious, some of them bereaved, some of them with their faces blurred. It was still noisy, but the great noise had changed to a tone of hissing and laughing.
Where is this? Who are they? What's going on?
Wait, let's see what's happening on the sidelines? The commentator of the live broadcast of the game suddenly became excited, he stood up and looked down from the top of the podium, the main striker of the Oak Forest team, David Johnson, was hit by the coach's seat in the fight with the other players, and poor Tony Don was standing on the sidelines to direct the game... wow! Look at the misery on the ground, it was a real Mars-to-Earth crash!
Don was lying on the ground, his light gray suit was wet, and his mouth was covered with grass and dirt, looking as if it had been used.
A man with a big nose and a long black beard, somewhat like Mario, appeared in his vision, and he put on his white gloves from the leather bag he had been carrying, and began to examine Donne's body.
Hell, he's like a backwards earth!
Can you hear me? He reached out his hand and frowned in front of Dawn, his tone clearly more anxious than before.
The video was shot in the middle of the night and the TV screen began to repeat the scene that had just been shown.
David Johnson was pushed by the opponent in a fierce match with the opponent No. 14, then the black big slanted body rushed to the side of the pitch Tony Don. But strange is that Don could have avoided, he had plenty of time, but now it seems like a puppet stood on the side of the pitch, tears watched his teammates hit themselves.
The Forest players were anxiously surrounded by the coach's bench, with Donne lying on the ground in the centre of the crowd, and David Johnson kneeling on the ground, praying incessantly. If his coach had a three-pointer, he would have been the first player to kill his own coach on the pitch.
Unlike the nervous Forest players, whose opponents mostly stand in the field, arms around each other, there are also curious people who take on the role of team scouts, running around to see the fans and then running back to share the situation with their teammates in the crowd.
The Forest fans on the stands seem not to be worried about the life of their head coach, they take the opportunity to curse their own team's poor performance, with words beginning with "F" or "s" coming out of their mouths, and countless middle fingers raised high and high, and even a 0:2 shot on the big screen with a particularly sharp eye.
Forest's team doctor Gary Fleming was still doing his best, he had just seen Tony's eyeballs move, how come he didn't react?
He slapped Tony's face and Don's still didn't respond. The team's acting head coach was lying on the ground like a statue, his mouth was open, his eyes were closed, as if he had seen something surprising.
The blue sky, the white clouds like cotton candy, the faces of different colors and expressions, the noisy environment, all familiar, yet so strange, as if miles away from themselves.
The referee indicated that the team doctor was looking after him and that he could not let the game be suspended indefinitely because of the injuries he had suffered off the field. He whistled for the players to return to the field and the game continued, even though the Forest players had lost their hearts.
The referee was not happy with the referee's attitude, and he pointed to the tunnel where the referee was still lying.
You call an ambulance, I'm just the referee! The referee didn't hesitate to turn around, and he didn't seem as dangerous as you said. He pointed to Fleming's back and ran back to the court.
Fleming turned to see Don getting up, his head still in his hands, and he rushed up to help him. "How are you feeling, Tony?"
Don's question is: "Where is this?"
Fleming turned and said something nasty, and it's been a long time since that happened. "Judas, Judas, come here!" he said, gesturing for a golden man to come in the coach's seat.
The man called Johnston came running. What about Tony?
He even asked me where it was.
The reaction of Des is similar to that of Fleming, who also twisted his head and said something dirty.
I suspect it was the impact that caused his back to hurt, as he had just fallen.
Is it bad for you, Gary?
I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad.
What does that mean?
The good news is that he has a short-term memory loss, and rest will ease it. The bad news... do you need me to say more?
But now the game is on and we are behind and we need him to lead the game... He says he looks back at Tony and Donne, but he is surprised to see Donne walking slowly towards the players.
Oh! and Pence hurriedly threw Fleming down, ran up and grabbed his colleague.
In the midst of the noise, the shouts of the Tang Tang Claw actually have the effect of a whisper.
Donne looked back at the cold, cold look in the eyes of Des, now with the golden glow of the sunset overhead, but he could not see any of the light in the pair of eyes.
Tony, where are you going?
I don't know, maybe... it's home... Don't you want to see the hand of Deeds?
Fleming also came running from the side: "Tony, you can't go home now. We're playing, you're the head coach, you're the one who's going to lead the team!"
The three men's drag on the passing board attracted the attention of the two reserve teams and the crowd, including the players on the field who occasionally glanced at the area.
Don suddenly laughed: "Oh, I'm a coach? Oh, that's ridiculous, how could I be a coach... I'm a fan and I play football manager games all the time, but how could I be a coach?
Fleming, next to the two men who introduced the first meeting, said: "He's a former England midfielder who retired from the team last season, and now he's your colleague, your assistant".
Don nodded, then said to Des: "Okay, now you're in charge of the game, and I'm going to rest". After saying that, Des's hand, no longer bothered by the huge booing and two people with their eyes closed, entered the passageway.
Fleming looked at Donne's back and then at Des'Walker.
Walker sighed, turned around and walked back.
Downs sat in the passage, with his back to the wall, looking at his surroundings in a daze. On his brightly colored wall was a huge sign, with a red dome underneath a three-way wave-shaped curve, and below it was an English word: Forest.
Where am I? What's going on?
Don touched the back of his head, where he was still in pain.
I'm going to hit him in the back!
What do you call me? He mumbled, but then suddenly stopped his mouth. Up to this point, he had been speaking only in bird and English.
Shit, what the hell is going on?
Finally finding out where he was, Donne was stuck again, so much so that his brain stopped responding after the load was calculated. And it seemed as if it had nothing to do with him anymore.
This is the scene at the City Stadium this afternoon, where Forest's acting head coach Tony Downs stood on the sidelines and was knocked down by his teammates, after which he appeared to have slipped into a brief coma. When he woke up, he walked straight into the players' corridor.
With the faint glow of the street lights outside, Dawn stands in the bathroom and looks at herself in the mirror. A middle-aged ghost with a raised nose, deep eyelids, blue eyes, and a slightly curved orange head.
The real Don from Sichuan, China, is only 26 years old, and the people in the mirror are even wearing their hair up! 34!
He not only miraculously descended upon an Englishman, but crossed the four years and three months!
Although he never felt that he was tall enough to attract the attention of many girls, he was able to do so.
He rushed at the mirror, and with one punch he broke it. The mirror itself was suddenly transformed into a thousand pieces, the fragments fell to the ground and the sound of a thunderclap was heard, and the thousand faces looked at Don as if they were laughing at him.
Donne felt a little dizzy, and he took a step back, leaning against the smooth wall, and breathing roughly with a big mouth.
After a few minutes of silence in the darkness, Donnie gradually recovered, and decided not to think about such a complex problem. He had a habit in China, and as soon as he encountered something unpleasant, he would find a place to drink.
Looking up at the cloudless sky outside, he went out the door wearing a thick windbreaker.
Having lost 3-1 at home to a weaker Walsall side, Forest have had a disappointing season recently. The highly-anticipated Paul Hart did not bring the team a good result, and he submitted his resignation to team chairman Nigel Dougherty after the last round of matches, which was quickly approved.
The TV on the rack is showing today's sports news, focusing on everything that happens naturally on the pitch at Nottingham Forest.
The noise of the bar was echoed by a buzzing noise.
A drunken big man raised his middle finger to the TV. Oh, that Tony Don I know him! The little hairy kid who used to help Paul Hart in the youth team.
The drunk had just finished his long speech when Donne pushed the door open. The sound of the door attracted the attention of most of the drinking and chatting in the bar, and everyone looked at the door, first surprised to see who was coming in, then with a sarcastic smile on their faces.
A typical middle-aged English man with a wine glass stood up and shouted, "Oh, Coach Tony Downs is coming!"
The people in the bar were shouting their welcome.
The middle-aged man raised his wine glass, and the people around him immediately followed suit and raised their wine glasses.
Another man, clearly drunk, stood up, walked over to Donne, held a beer bottle to his mouth, and asked: "Tony, Coach Donne, that was a nice defense, but the referee and the public obviously didn't... didn't think so... wow!"
He turned his head to the other people in the bar and laughed.
So he shoved the bottle of wine in front of him with a sullen face. Then he went straight to the bar and said to the bartender inside: "Please bring the bottle... " He was accustomed to thinking about the bottle of wine, although he was from Sichuan, but he was in the north of the university, and since then he liked this intense wine, but he did not speak English, but more importantly he quickly reacted.
When the other disciples who had been watching him said this, they all shouted, "He has asked for the strongest wine ever!"
Oh, and coward Tony drinks too?
The young wine-drinker, facing the excited guests, was a little puzzled, and wanted to get some wine, but was stopped by the drunken spirits, who said, "Bring him some juice!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We have fresh milk, and we have fresh milk, and we have fresh milk.
I'm not going to say anything.
The owner of the bar, startled by the noise outside, came down from the stairs and stood at the entrance, and saw that almost all the guests who had not yet slept at the tables were gathered around the bar, and in the middle of them sat a man in a black windbreaker, who was being mocked by the drunkards.
His loud voice immediately calmed the bar. The drunkards, who had been very excited, were silenced when they saw the man standing behind them.
Donne wondered who had brought the crowd down with a single word. He turned his head a little and saw a man emerge from the shadows of the stairwell.
The young bartender pointed at Don and said, "Hey, boss, he wants a shot of liquor".
Some of the people who were there were astonished at the sight of him, and said, "He has been raised from the dead".
But... but they don't make it... the bartender has a hard time seeing the drunkards who have returned to their seats.
The man looked around the bar, but the people he saw did not lower their heads, either pretending to be asleep or lowering their heads to make the ladies drink. Dawn became more interested in the well-rounded middle-aged man in front of her.
I see no objection, but I'll pour him a glass of Scotch, and I'll invite him. The bar owner turns to Dawn and asks, "One or two?"
The next day, the drunken people were laughing at the heat.
The bar owner laughed too. "Oh, I forgot who you are"... He poured half a glass of golden whiskey into the glass, then added half a glass of water. Then he handed it to Don: "This is my hometown wine".
Donne took a sip and coughed, and he rarely drinks any liquor. And this pure Scotch whisky has a strong, charcoal flavor.
The bar was filled with laughter and a lot of good and bad news.
Don Don, as I know him, never drank, and was a real traditional Puritan. And he wouldn't look at me like that now, you know who I am. Don Don Don, the man stared at Don Don, and now it seems like Don himself is being watched by this man.
He had to find a way to disguise himself. Oh... I see, Dawn bowed down and took another sip, this time he didn't dare let the liquor stay in his throat for a second longer, and it just went straight down, and the pain was a little lighter.
The other was a laugh.
The man touches his head and then his head, showing understanding.
Someone next to Don helped him untie the fence, and a loud voice shouted: "Looks like our coach Tony's head has been smashed in!" The man sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, two-time European Cup winner, 1978 Stanley Cup winner Kenny Burns! He's a hundred times stronger than your stupid ass!
The crowd laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed, and the man who was behind him laughed and the man who was behind him laughed and the man who was behind him.
His dirty words were reversed by a thick glass of wine, and Donne threw them at each other with a sudden and unexpected rush. He had come to this place, and had been through four and a half years, and had been ridiculed and insulted. He now wanted to find someone to spill, whether he had knocked someone down or someone had knocked him down.
The two hit the back of the table, and the empty bottle fell, shattering the floor in a crackling noise.
The laughter stopped and everyone stopped. They didn't think that Tony, who had been a coward, would suddenly explode.
The first to react was the bar owner Kenny Burns, who pushed a fat man who was standing next to the bar and shouted: "What are you doing standing there?
In addition to the misery on the ground, the man who was beaten had blood on his forehead, where a red circle appeared, the mark of the mouth of the cup. In addition, his left cheek was hit with a punch, as if drunk with wine.
And Donne, nothing but a mess of head and clothes. He seemed to have let his anger out, not to have been dragged up to the fight, he put his clothes and head in order, and then he said to the poor devil who was being held up:
Then he turned to Burns and said, "I'm sorry I messed you up today. It's been a f***ing day. He's pissed off at the thought of being crossed. I'll come and apologize to him myself, and don't worry about the compensation".
Then, without waiting for the bar owner to make a sign, he turned and walked to the door. When the fat man had passed, he also said: "Give your milk to your mother or leave it for yourself to drink, fat pig".
And they saw him push the door, and go out, and no man took him by the hand, but they wept, and saw him go away, and left him a waste.
A silence in the bar. At this point the drunken ghost sat up from the table, looked at the silence of the room and the confusion, and asked in confusion: "What did I miss?"
Don't be a fool! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Don cry like that?
Since his own father's previous life was pretty bad, why not use this opportunity to live a different life? Although he has never been a football coach, but he has also watched football for more than a dozen years, football manager games have been played by every generation, and to understand the nature of some coaches' work, isn't this a good opportunity to challenge?
He no longer has to think about why God chose him to be such a boring question. He now only needs to think about how to be more like a real professional coach, which is hard but worth trying.
Hey, man. You broke into my house without my permission, I'm calling the police if you don't leave! Suddenly, there's a loud noise next to you.
Don looked at the old man who was standing opposite him, holding a lot of newspapers and a half-eaten hamburger.
This is your house? He's referring to the chair under his ****.
Oh, of course.
Oh, sorry to bother you... Donnie got up from his chair, and the other man sat down immediately and lay down. He covered himself with the newspapers in his arms and pressed them firmly between the back of his chair and his body.
Watching the contented beggar eating a hamburger and lying in a tray of newspapers, Donne even thanked God that he hadn't let his own mother get close to him.
A taxi pulled up in front of him, and he walked quickly up and drove in. Down in the car, he looked at the beggar who was lying in the cold wind enjoying a delicious dinner for the last time, and asked the driver to take him back to the stranger's house.
From today, a whole new world slowly unfolds before Dawn's eyes. On Saturday morning, the wind and the sunshine, the glow of the path to sterilization...to sterilize his cat.
The cat in the bag is a yellow-brown cat, also known as a wildcat. The head, back, and limbs are covered with a layer of yellow-orange patches.
The white gloves are said to have a second-death effect on girls, controlling their brain waves and making them make the sound of "ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah".
Although it is a male cat, its eyes are large and it looks very cute.
The cat was now screaming, tearing his lungs apart. Most domestic cats are very domestic, and they would rather stay at home all their lives, and moving or going out is a very scary thing for them.
Meanwhile, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dim meteor slowly crept through outer space, gradually flying over China, the surface of the meteor glittering with a strange glow, seeming to be constantly emitting some kind of ray towards the surrounding void.
In the Star Pet Hospital, Liu Yiyuan placed the cat bag in the front desk: "I sterilized my cat, I had an appointment, my name is 。"
You have not visited us before, so you need to fill in the information box for your medical history.
In outer space, the meteor slowly crossed the skies over China and began to move towards the Pacific Ocean. Many cats suddenly trembled as the meteor passed by, and a deep glow flashed through their eyes, just like the glow emitted by the meteor.
The woman, who was in her mid-thirties, was in a coma for several days, and was unable to walk.
The nurse screamed, and the other one, who was shouting, jumped out, grabbing the matcha that had escaped.
The speed of the show was too slow, and the body of the matcha was not caught, but the tail of the matcha was caught.
The tail was caught, the tea was sizzling, and instinctively the head was turned back to the direction of the show, and the bite was taken, which is the instinct of the feline, and the speed was unexpected, and instantly a mouth was opened on the back of the show's hand, and the show's back was painful, and the hand was immediately relaxed.
Perhaps knowing that he was in trouble, Matcha did not continue to run, but just shrunk his body, looking at the display with some unease.
"You're a cat, you bite what you bite, you're a rebel!"
The cat's eyes flashed with a faint light, and the silk bloodstains on his teeth disappeared.
He felt his head suddenly shake, and then he wanted to see the wound on his hand, but it was a slight glance, only a white spot on the back of the hand, where there were wounds and blood.
The little nurse next to me says to the cat: "Make some tea, it's okay, you'll be fine in a minute, don't worry".
The cry, which was heard in the boasting ears, was not a mere cat's cry, but became a word that could be understood.
Shocked, Yang Yao pointed at the matcha in front of him and said with a surprised face: "Oh, this...this...this cat has spoken!"
The little nurse looked at Yang in confusion and said, "Mr. Yang, are you okay?"
"I'm not going to let you go", he said, "I'm going to let you go".
The little nurse raised her eyebrows, and the look in her eyes became increasingly strange.
Can you hear me?
Please take me home!
I'm scared of the piss.
He opened his mouth wide and looked at the little nurse who was still comforting Matcha, and said, "Can you hear me?"
I can hear, I can hear, I'm going home, take me home, I can hear, I'm going home, take me home, I can hear, I can hear, I'm going home, take me home, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I can hear, I
The little nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at the stranger who was talking to the cat, but her face became more and more strange.
Despite the strange look of the nurse, Yang Yao quickly picked up the matcha and put it back in her bag, and ran out of the hospital.
In the rented house, the tea cat returned to its familiar surroundings and immediately relaxed, laying on the teapot and began to caress its white hands, eyes raised, and a relaxed face. For cats, hair removal has always been a very suitable act to be used for relaxation.
Before tea, the staring matcha cat stared deadly at the staring matcha cat, trying to say: "Mom, can you still talk?"
When he said this, he stood upright and began to speak abusively to the centurion. "What are you doing, mister? " he asked.
"Oh, this one... let's play again". Liu Yiyu grabbed his head and said, somewhat confused: "When did you learn to speak?"
The face of a pure, matcha cat, the face of a stranger.
The tea cat, however, did not feel at all strange about the situation before her, and suddenly jumped into the arms of the show, staring at the body with her eyes, and her mother's voice said: "Come play with me".
The two cats, who look and talk like five-year-olds, are touching each other's heads, and the latter reveals a howl of pleasure.
You are only one year old, which is the equivalent of five years old for humans. You're still a child, so it's not bad.
A month later, at 9 o'clock at night.
Showing a tired face, he opened the door of the apartment, took off his clothes and sat down on the sofa.
The rented house where he lives, although only thirty piles, but the fully furnished house, is a house used by a newly married couple, and is close to the company, so he does not have to worry about traffic problems every day, so although the rent is not cheap, it still shows his willingness to show off.
After he had fallen to his death, Matcha Cat climbed up to him, and held his arm with his head, a warm and friendly look.
The first time I saw her, I was surprised to see her face, and I was surprised to see her face.
But then the matcha was pushed over the phone on the sofa.
Chapter 1
The little girl was lying on the table, her thin white arms resting on her little head, her long, black hair hanging in the air, revealing her half-girl face, warm, hot.
What's going on?
She was burning her face with a constant source of heat, and she was feeling bad. Today she came to Tientsin from Yeochun and just drank a glass of white water that Han Xiaofeng brought her.
Han Choi-young, her half-sister, is a member of the Korean community.
Don't be so hard on her, she jumped down, go after her, don't let her run away!
Dong Yi is a half-awake, half-spirited girl, and Han Xiaoyuan has designed her!
What should I do?
Don looked at the man as if he had caught a life-saving straw, "Mr. Yang, save me, I've been drugged, and there are some men behind me who want to blow me up".
The men, who were both cold and dark, looked behind the girls, and the men, who were pale but chilling, looked behind them.
The men are all mixed up and have seen some of the world, and this is the man who has covered the headlines of the financial magazines and controls the economic life of the whole empire, the man they have seen on TV.
The first one is the one that I'm going to write.
The man they could not bear, so they turned and ran away. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, a terrible battle was being fought, with angels of flame on wings, knights in heavy armor, crusaders with long golden swords, and a horrifying army of evil death knights, with a group of skeletons covered in black smoke, and countless mercenaries.
The stranglehold of the battlefields on both sides is not a plain of fire and smoke or a burial ground of skeletons, but a dark place where the edges are invisible, which is certainly a strange idea.
But even more strange was the fact that outside the battlefield, in the void of endless darkness, a few voices of secret treaties could be heard whispering.
I'm not going to be able to do it, but I'm going to do it.
You're the one who's got to control your death knight, when the others are saying, "Death knight and the moving fortress are fighting!"
Where is my army, O Lord, who is my adversary? where is the enemy?
After the battle, the angels, knights and deserters who had been present on the battlefield disappeared into the background darkness, and the place was again in absolute silence, shrouded in endless darkness, as if nothing had ever happened.
But some voices are still communicating, and even more are joining in.
My comrades are pigs! the dogs are stronger than them! not only do they not help the battlefield, but they also want to take the command of the core troops... the voice that failed before you said something grudgingly.
Oh! it is clear that the undead are too cowardly, and it would be different if they were replaced by my legions of demons... Oh! another voice also replied unabashedly, and made this forceful defense for its wrong command: Oh! I thought that the knights of death could easily solve those castles.
After hearing this voice, several small laughs could not bear to be heard in the darkness, and the contending parties suddenly lost courage, saying helplessly to the victorious side: "The art of fighting is not as good as man, but the wind is obeyed".
And the winner is the one who makes a round of unseemly ridicule?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Before our power, whether ghosts or demons, even God will kill you.
This is no doubt more irritating, as the parties that had been calmed down suddenly started a new round of abuse, while the third person, who was floating outside the new battlefield, asked a question that was a bit frustrating: "Oh, shouldn't I be organizing this round of games?"
The first, the terrible and violent war, was just a game.
A voice that wasn't in the game responded: "It's amazing that you can simulate a real war and make us, the bystanders, feel like we're in it, you're really good at surprising us, I hope you're right".
And the guy who is called Hope looks at the other guy and says this sudden thank you, and the low-key answer is: "You've won the prize, it's just a game".
Yes, the battle of life and death between the forces of good and evil is only a diversion, adding a little joy to this endless prison.
This is a void beyond the realm of reality, a place that should be forever dark, cold, and silent, a place where no living thing can survive, a place that is more terrible than death.
Yet in such a place, a dead place that could hardly contain any living thing, there persisted a group of creatures of a difficult quality, who had lost their bodies, and only the last consciousness remained in this void.
They call themselves the Vail-doers, and are imprisoned for ever in this prison called the Void.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were the supreme powers of all races and fields, the masters who reached the peak of magic, the fighters who touched the limits of martial arts, the alchemists who created all things, the steadfast and pure missionaries, the demons who ruled the hell, the witch-demons who controlled the soul, and so on. They left their names in the history of all the faces.
Many people think they are long gone, and only those who have been recorded in history know that these old monsters, strong enough to be described as mutants, have been imprisoned in the endless void beyond the surface for countless years, and seem to be imprisoned there forever, and that the thin barrier between the surface and the void is the wall of sighs they can never break through, except that the power they once possessed is so great, and there is nothing to be done about it.
But they never gave up hope of escape, because among the 33 Vacuum Walkers there was one very special person, the fifth person with the code name Hope.
Hopefully, the original Whitey, not from the big, small worlds of human existence out of nowhere, but from a strange place called Earth, was an editor of a small news website, whose daily job was to extract news from other websites at home and abroad, and then replace it with a new one like Bang!
The men will shout, the women will be silent, and so on, and then publish the headlines on their own websites, a noisy and boring job.
Later, Bai Yi died in an accident, but his consciousness did not immediately disappear, but instead entered the mysterious void under the shadow of the sun, devoured several other void walkers, and finally survived until this moment.
The Void Walkers insist that he is the key to escape from this endless prison from a different world, that you are the only one who is different, that you are the only one who wants to leave here, and I am convinced of this, so I call you by the code name of Hope.
They have been holding on to this, believing that they will one day see the sun again, even though they have been imprisoned for countless hours, for hundreds of years?
To survive for thousands of years in this eternal prison without going mad, it is obviously not enough to talk or discuss, in fact the main means of entertainment for the Vagabonds is an activity called memory sharing.
The activity is based on a mindfulness technique called memory retrospection, which allows people to recall every detail of their experiences, even every single item on a newspaper, with clarity.
And then, with a certain amount of editing, removing memories that you don't want to be seen, like sleeping with women or with left-handed people, and then swapping them with each other, it's like watching a super-long movie about someone else's life, which is a great way to pass the time.
The memory of the thirty-three void walkers was equivalent to having him experience thirty-three lives, even if he later forgot most of them to avoid memory confusion, retaining only their knowledge and experience, but his mind also in the experience of thirty-three lives, overcame these weaknesses of childishness and volatility, became mature and calm, and was no longer the ordinary man on earth.
So he was looked up to by other vagabonds, and yet the years passed, and even he found no occasion to part with them, but only to make the dull and dull time a little less dull.
Meanwhile, in the real world, the sun is setting on the campus, and the students are finishing the day's hard work by walking in pairs along a leafy pathway in the campus, with cheerful laughter from the young and upbeat.
A second-year student of the Soul-Kissing School, Mia, with a cute brown face, long black hair with two equally cute double ponytails, wearing the standard uniform of the Sensei Academy, after a simple farewell to her classmates, came alone to the Academy Square, found a bench and sat down, then scooped out some half-bread left over from the dinner from her pocket, carefully tearing the bread into little pieces, then carefully rubbing it on the asphalt floor of the square.
A few white doves fell down at her feet, and, with their heads bowed, ate the bread she had dropped, and, with a shriek of thunder, swept the ground with her movements, and her long ponytails, and her careful winged tail, and her quiet gaze on the flock and the familiar monkeys, and a smile of consolation on her face.
Beautiful young girls, gentle white lilies, and silent statues in the square, together with the lush vegetation around them, gathered together in the final golden afterglow of the sunset, to form a picture of a mermaid.
This is what Mia does every day, and it is the most relaxing part of her day, as a student with a general qualification, life at the Sensei Academy is always extremely hard.
It's getting dark, come here today, I have to go back to practice, goodbye, monkey gentlemen. With a light smile on her face, she said goodbye to the bunch of monkeys, then walked in her short uniform, put down her thin legs wrapped in white silk, and hurried back to her dorm.
The evening is also an important time for studying, especially for a student with a talent like Mia's, and the effort required is not as easy as it seems to her to always have a smile on her face.
1. Chapter 1
The ceremony of awakening the martial spirit is being held in the Su family mansion, a huge military exercise ground.
The young man at the altar, whose name is Suyu, is the eldest son of the Su family, and is very gifted.
Sumo, the son of the Su family's head Su-hong, completed the nine-fold challenge at the age of fourteen and was known as the first genius of the Su family.
Now that a genius like Su Yu has emerged, the martial spirit awakened by Sumo's talent will surely be no worse than Su Yu.
If sumo can awaken the martial spirit of the fifth level or higher, then the Su family can emerge two top geniuses, whose future development of the Su family is not insignificant.
When the presiding elder called out the name, the shocked disciples, elders and others all looked at the younger man next to them, expectantly, eagerly, and even more than the previous Suyu.
Sumo's face was calm, and he raised his feet and walked to the altar.
Suyu, who was coming down from the altar, with a haughty face, gave a cold smile to Sumo, her eyes filled with provocation.
Sumo took a deep breath, without paying attention to the other, and sat down on her knees with her eyes closed.
From beneath that altar, a path of light immediately burst forth, continually penetrating Sumo's body.
His talent was at the top of the Sumo family, and he completed his training at the age of fifteen. His talent was not very good. However, he was always overwhelmed by Sumo.
At this time, the shining symbols on the altar became more and more numerous, and covered the body of Sumo.
Sumo, who was sitting with his eyes closed, breathing with a slight rush, heard a thunderous roar from his body.
All the people stopped breathing, and the dead stared at the altar.
I'm not sure.
At last, a sound broke, and a dark shadow suddenly rose, like a black hole, slowly turning inside, without a bottom, giving a feeling of coldness.
At the same time, a yellow halo is flashing above the shadow.
What a surprise!
The whole crowd was stunned.
A halo?
The lowest level of martial arts?
How is this possible?
Even Su Yu was stunned, his face was frozen.
Because he could not imagine that the first genius of the Su family would only awaken the martial spirit of the first class of people, the lowest martial spirit!
Sumo sat on the altar, his eyes slowly opened, saw his own soul, and was also stunned.
The first-class martial soul of the human class...! The Sumo of the Yang said to himself, and the corner of his mouth raised a bit of bitter laughter, he did not think that he had awakened a low-class martial soul!
The most trashed martial spirit?
What a first genius, the first waste of my family.
For a while, everyone, including the elders of the Su family, the ministers, and others, looked at Sumo with a different look, disappointed, disgusted, and contemptuous.
At the altar, Sumo slowly got up, and unconsciously raised her fists.
The cold look of the eyes turned around, and Sumo laughed in her heart: "Oh, these people are so powerful!
In the past, Sumo was a great talent, everyone was friendly to him, wherever he went, he was greeted by a call and a hug, and the sound of horses was heard.
Now that he has awakened the garbage-crowd, the people have changed their faces instantly.
So he shook his head, and without taking them into account, he walked down from the altar and walked away.
The face is a little wrinkled, and there seems to be a patch of grass around it.
I'm not dead from a car accident, how did I survive?
He was a little surprised, but before he could figure out how he had escaped death, the sight of him made him open his eyes in excitement.
How can a girl who looks so beautiful be so random?
Xu Shizhu opened his eyes. He looked at the beautiful girl with tears, and the curtain was completely removed before his eyes, and the impurity inside came out little by little, and into the eyes was a soft white, with a unique body odor of a woman.
Girl, what are you doing, you can't pee everywhere!
The scene was suddenly shattered. She screamed, panicked, and the whole group jumped from the ground, and then she stepped on a sword and flew across the sky.
I lean, is this the sword? Is this the sword that flies?
What the hell is a fairy?
At the same time, a strange and familiar memory suddenly appeared in his head, as if it had been a normal experience since birth.
I fucking crossed!
The first thing that came to mind was that it was not his memory, but that he had forgotten everything.
This is a fairy world, just like the little fairy who is angry and swords flying in the sky, people can practice all kinds of arts and crafts.
And the owner of this body is a dumb ass, but this dumb ass is a complete idiot.
He is a poor orphan, but he has a unique spiritual root that is rare in the world.
In his youth, he was recruited by the emperor as a horse, and provided him with countless treasures to train him, and in just six years he solidified his belly, entering the golden age.
When he entered the Golden Age, he really entered the cave with the princess, and spent seven days and seven nights in the marriage bed, and the fairy princess, like a fox, made him a complete failure, and even the genius of the spirit was taken away.
The genius, who had just married, was reduced to a ruined man, and without any use of his value, he was sent out of the palace in a low tone all night, and was beaten to death by a handful of men arranged by the emperor on the way to the border, and died of exhaustion, and was finally abandoned.
Oh, what a shame!
After clearing these memories, Xu's face was filled with regret, and he shook his head and sighed, saying, "Oh, damn it!
Thinking of the beauty of the princess who sold her soul on her wedding bed, the arrogant body, and the breath of all kinds of winds, Xu Zhi felt increasingly sorry for coming a step late!
You bold whore, how dare you steal the maiden like a monkey, give me life.
Then a sudden shout of reprimand came, and the fairy went away and returned.
She was filled with shame and anger, but with endless killing in her eyes, and under her feet she stepped on the sword of the cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
You're not going to kill me, but you're going to take my ass upstairs first. You're not going to give me any incentive to run away!
The woman suddenly changed her face, and the red-faced general, who was lying on the floor, shouted, "You whore, you want to die". The sword flew faster and faster, and she killed Xu Shi.
The man was running around, thinking about how to escape.
Suddenly, an inspiration flashed in my mind.
At once he stopped, reached out his hand, and touched a familiar sign from his arm, and turning to the woman he cried out: "O brave fairy, I am the rider of the Fire-kingdom today, and you dare not respect me? Beware, I will kick you nine times!"
At that moment, a series of systematic prompts suddenly sounded in Xu's head.
Congratulations host, Xu Shijian, activated the face-up system, which will help you navigate the ship, and help you fly!
The host, Liu Xiuqian, was successful in her dress, and was awarded 1 point for her dress, did she enter the mall for a change?
The system detects that the host, Liu Xiuqian, is weak and has difficulty surviving in this world, and rewards a gift to the newcomer.
When the audio is triggered, a screen window appears with a few pieces of information.
Xu Shi took a breath and laughed out loud. What a system of face-to-face confrontation, it was made for me, to help me break through the system of heaven and earth!
You whore, you're dying, what are you laughing at?
Suddenly, a scolding voice pulled Xu Zhi back from the ecstasy.
The woman, not knowing when, stood before him about fifty yards, with a spear in her hand, and the great eyes of the water-spirit were watching him with suspicion.
Come on... you want to get in my face?
Congratulations to host Zhao Xuexiang for successfully masquerading as a man, and 1 point for masquerading as a woman.
Of course, the system's warning sound that only Xu Zhizhi could hear sounded again, and he couldn't help but laugh again.
Suddenly, the picture of the window of the screen before us changed, a square gift box appeared, the gift box was opened, several streams of light jumped out, and flashed away.
Congratulations to host Xu Shijian for the first-class experience Dan, who has 10,000 experience points.
Congratulations to host Xu Xiuqian for getting two first-class walking stickers, which can be instantly moved to any place outside the five square kilometers.
The first stage of the building is only for the foundation stage, after which it can be exchanged in the mall.
, detected a deficiency in the host, Liu Xu, and the system will replenish all the roots for you.
The next day, Xu felt an electric current pass through his body, and his scalp instantly went numb.
The next thing you know, you're feeling relaxed, your hair is all open, and you're all gasping for air.
I'm not sure.
Soon, he felt his body change dramatically, becoming closer to nature, as if he could integrate into everything, control everything.
But he knew how familiar this feeling was, that he had felt so close to the flame when the Fire God's Root had not yet been taken by the Princess, and that the system now not only restored his Fire God's Root, but also supplemented the other attributes of the Root God.
The five roots of the five elements are all aligned at once, and each one is the highest degree of the five elements.
I'm going alone, it's going to be hell!
Thinking about this, Xu Zhi finally couldn't help shaking his arms and shouting: "The system of bribery is in hand, I have, what a fucking fire emperor, the emperor of the fire emperor, wait for my Xu Zhi to upgrade, and when I return, I will trample you all underfoot and trample you to pieces".
How dare the bold whore, since she calls herself the fire-king's mule, yet speak folly, pretending to mock the king? Has the woman beside the mule heard the moan a little, has this mule lost her mind?
Congratulations to host Zhao Xuexiang for successfully masquerading as a man and earning a 1 point.
Xu Shih was slow to speak, and took a small puff of his tongue, and, looking forward to the future, almost forgot the trouble, and hurried to find a way to run.
That's right, experience Dan!
He suddenly remembered that there was another first-class experience in the beginner's gift package, Dan.
Without hesitation, he opened the package and found three items in it.
The use of the pot, the use of the pot. The pot was used to make the pot, and the pot was used to make the pot.
Congratulations to host Zhao Xuexian for his success in practicing the five-line Tai Chi.
Host, Xu Zhifeng, took the first-class experience Dan, and received 10,000 experience values
The host, Yang Xujian, was upgraded to the current level of the Exercise Zone.
The host, Yang Xujian, was upgraded to the third level of the current realm's training period.
The host, Yang Xujian, was upgraded to the current level of the tenth level of the Exercise Period.
In a short span of time, Xu Shiji transformed from a helpless mortal to a monk, and sprinted straight to the tenth level of the Ritual Period, just one step away from the foundation period.
And his strength is now ten times stronger than during normal exercise.
The reason is that he has five divine roots, which equals to a person having five times the strength of an ordinary person.
Even under the five different types of spiritual attributes, the force that erupts is far more than five times as simple.
This time I'm really speechless, I can't win, who can't win?
Xu Zhiyi was so excited that he could not stop. But at that moment, the woman in front of him was waving a stream of light, crossing the clouds, and the sword blade of the sword was moving between the eyes like a poisonous snake.
I only ask you, fairy, to come and ride this little beauty to the stables. Who told you to draw your sword? You are a thief!
Xu Zhixian saw the sword attack, and suddenly jumped, and immediately opened his mouth and cursed.
The sword swings back and forth, and the fingertips of the hands and feet are filled with the spirit of the water, and the sword blade is lightly shot.
The winner!
The sound of a crunching, sharp sword was fired from his head.
How could this be?
The woman was stunned, and Zongming was able to break the sword so easily, except for those who had built it to a very high level, and at least those who had built the sixth floor of the foundation!
I was confused, and everyone said that what happened was a misunderstanding, you still do not understand, and you want to kill me? Don't think that you look like a fairy and I won't hit you, anyway, I just didn't see it clearly, this time I saw it clearly.
Xu Shizong shouted at the fire, stepped on his feet, and the spirit of the land instantly merged into the earth, and the speed doubled, and in a flash appeared before the woman.
The woman was arrested on the spot, but the police did not release her, and she was arrested on the spot.
The woman was stunned, feeling that the fire element in her body was completely suppressed.
Oh, if you call me a whore, can I bear this whore without a cause?
Xu Shi, with a grin on his face, raised his eyebrows, and reached out his hand directly towards the woman's frown.
Chapter One If there is a future, dance with me!
The nine heavens, the clouds, the sea, the wind, the thunder, the sky!
And there were nine heavens and nine continents, and three days, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day, and a day.
But now, on the wind turbine, it's a hurricane and a fog!
Zhu Chuyang, give up your sword and live!
You are the first god of the universe, like Zhu Chuyang, the Nine-Tailed Sword, etc. In your hands, it is a waste, you have not progressed for many years, you are simply a tyrant of the heavens! Or give it up.
A loud cry came from all sides.
The eyes of the god are still as cool as a rock, the body is still as straight as a spear.
As the sword in his hand, full of meaning, though he was mortally wounded.
At his feet, hundreds of meters in circumference, were countless broken limbs, strewn with blood.
Looking around at the shouts, but not the crowds of nobles, Chuyang's face showed a smile, arrogant and unconcerned!
Such a man is a heart, and such a heart is a crown, and such a number, though they slay me ten thousand times, they are not worthy of me.
How could the Nine-Sword be leaked out of his hands? After three years of research, he finally found the cut of the Nine-Sword in the three-day storm, and after all the hard work, he finally found the opportunity to risk his life and come to the Nine-Sword for three days.
Today, he entered the third day, and is only the fifth day. Today, the death of pure death. He has always been known for his cunning ways, and who knows his plans?
He has washed himself a dozen times in succession, and each time he has been washed back. And these places he has chosen are all for the dead.
Extremely compassionate, extremely sword-like! He has destroyed his own affection for the sword, for the sword in the martial arts, for the martial arts seeking the way to heaven, for the cost of a lifetime of solitude, for the treasure of killing all over the world, but in the end he cannot practice the nine-destroyer sword, the nine-weight angel.
Is it the wrong choice, or is it the wrong path?
The ruthless swordsman is ruthless, and if the swordsman has compassion, what is the swordsman? The martial arts of the sword and the sword are ruthless after all....
O sword of doom, what is your secret?
Looking around greedily staring at the nine-dead sword, Chu Sun laughed bitterly. You only know that getting this nine-dead sword can be unstoppable in heaven, but you know how much I paid for this nine-dead sword.
Nothing is left.
Blood was flowing, Chu Yang clearly felt that his life was passing quickly, he pursued martial arts all his life, falling in love, falling out of love, and dying after falling out of love, and at the moment of death, he thought that the only regret should be that his life had not reached the highest level he pursued all his life, but what he did not think was that at this moment, a figure appeared in his mind, which he thought he had long forgotten.
"I'm not a dancer, but I'm a woman who loves to dance".
I didn't really have a break-up... A self-deprecating smile appeared on the corner of Yang Chuyang's mouth, and he said to himself:
A little remorse, quietly spreading in his heart, like smoke, suddenly overwhelmed his whole heart.
"Light dance! I don't know if I'll meet you this time at Yellow Spring?"
Come on, all of you! Let's just kill him! As for the sword of the Nine Deadly Sins, we discussed it slowly and without delay. One of us shouted: "If not, wait until he answers something, it will be our turn to do something!"
Dance for the king, dance through the life!
This is a poem by Mo Liang Dan on the night of the appointed time. Yu remembers that Mo Liang Dan's eyes were teary, her eyes were confused and angry, she... knew she was practicing with her love, but she still threw a fire in her arms, let herself burn as much as possible!
After hearing the news, he immediately ran away, but in the end he was a step behind. Although after him, all the people of the world who hurt Mo Mo lightly tried to kill all the people, even the dogs of the Kyushu, but the good people could not revive!
The eternal red man, as he lay dying, softly in his arms, said to himself: "Zhong Zhuyang, if there is a next life... if I can meet you again, I hope you will be well... look at me. I am better than the sword!"
Dance lightly, you are not satisfied, you are sorry, otherwise, how will your eyelids be wrinkled?
Two drops of clear water, but his heart was shattered in that moment, and from that moment on, this heart was covered with dust.
Life and death are nine!
This is a poem written by the first talent in the world, Seungri-chan, who felt a deep affection for Chuyang.
And now, dance lightly, you are nine years old, and I am still in the world of men... but I can be with you in life and death at once... for ever and ever!
Chuang thought of God, and a smile of tenderness and wonder hung over the cold corner of his mouth.
Dance lightly, wait for me!
Dance, thou knowest, if there were a life, I would rather not make any sword, than any peak, than take vengeance, than be with thee! What on earth can equal the laughter that satisfies thee?
No! not bitter... lightly dancing, you are bitter, but you don't feel bitter, now... I am bitter!
The swords became more and more, the blood flew out, the pain focused from all over the body, finally interrupting the song and dance in my mind!
Chuyang's angry old man, standing up, his black hair flying wildly.
Chu Yang's heart ached, he looked down, and the jade hanging from his neck was crushed before his eyes.
This is the only memory I have left of my dancing!
The sword of death in his hand suddenly swung with a great light, and suddenly became a belt of lightning, like nine days of lightning.
And the sound of the trumpet was like a great noise, and all the weapons that were round about him were cut off, and all the weapons that were round about him were cut off.
Everyone hurried back, terrified to see Chu Yang's feet neatly rounded with half-cut weapons, sweating cold sweat on his waistcoat.
Chuyang looked around, and suddenly asked softly: "Do you want the sword of the Nine Hells?"
When no one answered, he laughed bitterly, and said, "No, I will show you the sword of Nineveh".
He jumped up, and he was already deadly wounded, and he jumped up!
The sword of the nine-dead, a little cold and deadly!
As the arc is shot, the cold streaks come pouring out!
The nine-tone sword!
The name of the continent is Nine-Ton Heaven. All sword techniques in history have never dared to use these three words, but this Nine-Ton Heaven is the name of the sword of the Nine-Ton Heaven!
This is the only one!
Although Chuyang was not able to use the real power of the Nine-Dragon Sword, he realized that these swords had been around for a long time. The power of these swords, although not as great as imagined, is far beyond the worldly sword technique.
Dozens of swordsmen, knowing that this sword was not a small one, pulled out the bottom of the press box and tried to resist this attack! Everyone's body was shaking, feeling the weapon in his hand, and they were all unstable.
How much more, O sword of nine kings, slaughter the whole earth!
The first blast has already occurred; the disastrous second blast is about to come. Its raging torment will be like the raging of the sea, like raging waters that cover the face of the earth and the sky.
The cry was heard, and the dozen men, who had the strength to fight alone, withstood, but still, with blood in their hands, retreated in terror.
At this moment, everyone has an illusion: Chuyang is absolutely unharmed!
They did not know that they had interrupted Chuyang's memory, interrupted the song and dance of the Mo, and that Chuyang was completely enraged, completely unleashed all the potential of the body!
The sword of the nine-dead, the cloud of the wind is the king!
Chuang Hoan opened his eyes and said, "Why did you cry? Why didn't you cry?"
In the distance, in three directions, three lights rise at once, and in the air they appear as three golden shadows!
He is only a warrior, and although he is only one degree below the rank of king, this rank is not different from the rank of heaven and earth.
Three Kings, what a great pencil!
But for three days now, not in your district, a place where swords and might might might be spread! You alone and slowly: I only wish I could not fight with you fairly, alas!
When he had finished speaking, two others appeared with him. Three men, all in loose robes, with large sleeves, and robes, and wind, came up. Their faces were dark and gloomy.
Chuyang's eyes were already a little blurry: "Oh, you three kings... do you want the sword of the Nine Hostages too?"
You want to kill you! You three smile at the same time, and are surprised: You, however, by the way, took the sword of the Nine Ravens, and it is an unexpected harvest. Great harvest!
And he laughed, and stood upright, and said, Alas, that ye know not! Ye shall not attain it. And his eye was fixed, and he said, Alas!
He is no longer able to fight!
This is the only sword that he can use with full power, and when he first saw the hilt of the sword, he knew that he could wield it himself. But such a sword, it would require his own life to wield it!
A sword that will devour and destroy.
And the three kings, who could scarcely come to the end of their rope, and who could not even cry out, were consumed by the smoke of the ashes. Even the golden shadow of their royal power, which had been dissolved, shone in the sky, but their lives were reduced to nothing.
Chuyang sighed, half empty, eyes turned to one side, but found a person he thought should never be here. In the distance, a man in white looked at this side with a stunned look, his face full of unbelief.
Why is it that all of his covert actions are being covered up, and all of his attacks are being blocked?
He was a god, a demon, a demon. No wonder he was so defeated.
Chuyang's body slowly fell from the sky, slowly fell down, like the dead leaves of the late autumn, fell into the dust, with a faint but warm smile on his face, and said: "Dance lightly, if there is life, dance with me in heaven!"
If death is inevitable, then embrace it with the greatest passion and the most ardent longing, for there is your loved one.
Chapter two
The surprise of Mengzhi was interrupted, and the look of the little Shamis like Zhao was surprised and despised, and the meaning of the elementary school students to draw the line with the bad classmates was clear, only Huai Fenghua A7 stared at the statue of the Golden Buddha in front, a divine appearance.
Subconsciously, Mungi turned to look at the nearby cache, wondering if he could see any end of the tunnel.
For him, shame and frustration are minor, but the fact that he exposed himself to pay for his own death is a big deal!
The man's face was still bitter, his eyes were full of frustration, and after feeling the look of Mengzhi, he shook his head: Yang Nan is not the Buddha, everything is decided by the brother of the man. He did not hint, he said it directly.
He thought I saw him begging for mercy...Mungchi was calmly relieved to know that he had passed the point, and that he should not be seen unless he abandoned his parents, his horse-faced uncle, and so on, and if it was another ten or eight years, then no one would doubt it, and childhood memories would be easily forgotten.
It's a small thing to be in a juvenile detention center!
The twisted, upright Manchi tries to keep his expression as static as that of the real Huyi, so that he is not so depressed and sad that he is seen by the hidden.
After the wide-eyed, hard-hearted, and one-on-one interrogation of the remaining children, Gang Benji, along with Hu Hui, had six children admitted to the mixed-sex prison, and the rest belonged to the martial arts monastery.
The ring finger of his right hand gently tapped his left palm: "Come with me to the monastery to shave, take the Buddhist mantle, and so on, and live hard in the future, without having the opportunity to enter the Bodhisattva, the Dhamma and the Dharma to practice the high and profound Buddhist scriptures and martial arts".
Is there a Damo here?
He paused, but without giving him time to think, walked straight through the children and out of the temple.
The monks were all strangers, and Mengzhi, not daring to ask any more, followed the two yellow-clad monks, who were hiding behind the monks, and entered a nearby courtyard.
You don't have to enter the temple formally, just pray to the Buddha and shave your name.
The children all responded with the truth, and then one by one they knelt on the shrine, and the statue of the Golden Buddha above them.
After all the children had prostrated themselves before the Buddha, the Buddha joined his hands, and Bozhampa solemnly saluted the statue, recited the Buddha-Veda of the Buddha, and then he went to one of the children and placed his right hand on the top of his head.
The long, dark hair of the child changed into a yellowish-red, leafy, withered root as fast as Manci could see, and in less than two breaths the child became a real little shami.
The worries of the Buddha were over, the red dust was gone. The words of the Buddha were spoken with great dignity, and the sound of the Buddha's voice was heard in the pure and clean temple.
What is this martial art?
The next day, he was surprised and excited to learn that he would have the opportunity to learn martial arts in the future.
He went to the children one by one, removed their hair, and repeated the same words.
When it was Munch's turn, he bowed his head, reciting the name of Buddha and lamenting the hair that was about to be cut.
The thick and broad palm of his hand gently touched the top of the head of the Manchu, and a dead root fell before his eyes, which made him sad, almost unable to control himself, but he loved the red dust, never thought of leaving home to become a monk.
The trouble is over, the red dust is far away.
The sound of the bell suddenly ringing, shook Mengzhi's body and heart.
After Ka-Hyun's departure, Meng-Chi's belief remained firm that he would be back in the future!
After the Buddha, the shaving, and the monk's name, the monk had several gray-clad monks take the children to the backyard to get their belongings. They had two sets of gray robes, two pairs of shoes, a small forest rule, and a morning class of twelve small incantations.
Before that, I will first give a lecture on the main precepts of the temple, one, do not deceive the teacher to kill the ancestor, two, do not allow, do not steal martial arts, three, do not kill, four, do not drink alcohol, five, do not chew gum, six, do not break the rules... The main precepts will be required to be followed by the Feng Shui sufferers repeatedly, and ended with a serious sermon: punish the violator, reprimand the light, abolish the heavy martial arts, and expel the temple.
He mentions only two of them, the lightest and the heaviest, and the rest of them are hard labor, copying, reprimanding with sticks, and face-to-face punishment.
After this, he and the other young men left the house with the little girl.
The monks in gray robes are the general monks, the monks in yellow robes are the deacons of the monasteries, and the monks in yellow robes are the abbots, the heads of the monasteries and the elders.... On the way, the monk tirelessly instilled common knowledge in the monastery to the little shamis, until the people of the monastery entered the monastery of the monks, and he became silent again.
The more the pedestrian walked away, the more the yellow walls were covered with green trees, the less he saw the Buddha Temple, and after a while, Mengchi saw a patchwork of old courtyards.
Oh, my dear brother, my dear brother, you have come so early. At the door of the monastery a fat monk came up laughing, and also in yellow robes, but his collar was open, and his stomach was full.
He raised his brow and said without hesitation: "How can you be so stupid without Buddha, brother of the heart?"
The fat monk, who was already familiar with the temper of the monk, was not at all angry: "Oh, you are too obsessed with appearances, this is a disciple for our court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the court of the
He also asked the master to arrange for the meeting.
Then the man who had been silent for a long time suddenly said, "Should I be in the hall of the court?"
And the fat and the weak said, "What did you ask them to do? Did you intend to take them in vain?"
The secretary shook his head and sighed: "Oh, my martial arts have been destroyed, and how dare you deceive the son of man, how dare you accept students? Brother of the secretary, you are so tired of letting them be honest and honest with the truth. "
He was referring to Mengzhi and Hsi.
The heart of the monk began to beat violently, and for the first time he started to arrange his own affairs.
"Master, how dare I trouble you with such small matters? " He replied", I have no need of such things".
The head of the front of the front of the front of the front, did not say much, but the right color to Mengchi, Hakhui and other small shamis: I will put you in the mixed court, because you each have problems, if you can find the answer, to cultivate your heart, in the future may not have the opportunity to enter the monastery, the monastery, or even the Bodhi court.
But if you continue to be immoral and greedy and greedy and greedy and greedy and greedy and greedy, I will not hide it, but I will bring you to justice.
He spoke his mind without any disguise, with a calm, unobtrusive tone, and the old man's face turned red.
"Yes, Uncle Feng". Young Shamishi, like Yang Mengchi, answered in a low voice.
After the death of the first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh, the eighth, the ninth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the tenth, the
The monk... with a monk's costume, he entered the Zen room, following the heart of the monk as he walked east and west.
After pointing to both Menji and Makhui, he turned around and took the other young shamis to another Zen room.
In the Zen room there is a bed for seven or eight people, and nothing else.
On the bed, two monks in grey robes were lying down, all in their twenties, the face of the person lying there was stunned, silent, the person sitting there was frozen, cold: they packed their bags and left them under the bed, wanted to drink water, and went to the courtyard to fetch water.
After a glance at the wisdom of the wood-wooded tree, Mengchi decided to open his own mouth to establish a good relationship with his roommate.
The man sitting there says coldly: "You're right.
After answering, he stopped talking, and even turned his head away from Meng and Zhu Hui, leaving Meng to focus on the relationship.
As for the real reason, close your eyes and go back to sleep.
What a bunch of people!
Mengzhi's stomach turned dark, but he smiled at Hakhui: "Honghui, I'm sure, you'll call him later".
Yes, Master. You have no difficulty in calling out to the truth.
I'm not sure if it's the stupid little guy or the stupid little guy.
He said, "I'll call you my brother, but first let's change our monk's clothes".
Although there were people inside, Munshi, who had often stayed in his bedroom during his college days, was not uncomfortable, so he quickly took off his clothes and changed into a monk's robe.
He was thankful for the simple dress of the monk, and did not reveal himself, and examined the things that had not been examined before.
The body of the robe, delicately woven, soft in texture, is worth a lot even if Mengzhi does not know the goods, and at the same time, his mother has a piece of transparent jade hanging from his waist, and a small jade robe tied with a red cord on his neck, tightly pressed to his chest, cool and uncomfortable.
Munshi carefully played with the thumb-sized Buddha, only to see it full of compassion, alive, and obviously carved, and at the same time, touching it with a delicate touch, both warm and refreshing.
What is this? According to Uncle Yu, the Buddha was given by an unknown monk. But since the monk did not take it, it is not unusual, or it is better to wear it.
Mengzhi then put the jade on his chest again, hid it, and then collected the jewels, clothes, and other items and placed them under the bed of his choice.
At this time, the sleeping Zhao Jian suddenly turned and sat up, and with his shoes on, he went out the door, looking at Mengzhi, not understanding what was happening.
It was time for dinner. She said something coldly, got off the bed and walked out the door.
What kind of people are these two!
He said, "I'm not going to be able to do this, but I'm going to be able to do it".
Oh well! as soon as the voice of the sage was heard, the little figure came like a rabbit to the door, as if it were hungry.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's normal here.
He suddenly stopped at the door, looked back at Mengzhi, and asked him with a doubtful face: "Master, won't you go?"
If you have a conscience, wait for me!
I'm not as hungry as you are.
Look at you two, one by one, like a hungry abortion!
He turned and ran away.
After a few moments of trembling, he cried out: "Oh, Master, wait for me!
Suddenly, a wave of sadness struck him, and he said, "The others are my little sister, why do I have only my little brother, and there will be no little sister in the foreseeable future?"
Under the umbrella, a beautiful woman of twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, with a boy of five or six years old, kneels before the iron door of a luxurious villa.
The woman, named Yang Mei-Yuan, from a remote mountain village, had hoped to go to university six years ago with dreams and hopes, but had not expected to meet the man who would change everything for her, the famous flower boy from Hokkaido City... Li Zhe!
She was in a school with Li Zhe, and one day, she was accidentally spotted by Li Zhe, who then went crazy after her, almost by accident, without any means.
And Yang Mei-Jin was just a simple girl who had just come to the city, and she would be such a rival to a sex expert, not only in body, but also in mind, but then Li Zhe played with her, and Yang Ji-Jin threw her away.
Later, she found out that she was pregnant, and she wanted to have a baby, but she had a fight with her family.
After the birth of the child, Yang Mei-Feng wanted to raise him as an adult, but after five years, because the body was too tired, she had a terminal illness, and there were no more years to live, she finally decided to send the child to Li's family, wanting the child to feel the father's love, have a better life, then she can be reassured after death.
But this was rejected by the indifference of the Li family, who did not recognize the child as theirs, and Yang Mei-Feng could only kneel with the child in front of the iron door, crying bitterly.
At this time, the iron door opened slowly, and several people came out with a hammer, and the man who was leading them looked a little like the little boy, who was the boy's father, Li Zhe.
Give it to me, you stinking woman, this money is enough for you to live well. Li Zhe frowned and handed a check to Yang Mei.
Yang Mei-yang shook her head, looked up at Li Zhe, "Do, Zhe! You must leave your son, he is your son!"
Li Jie turned away, then coldly said, "What do you want the money for?"
I heard that she had already given me a peach and shook her head.
Li Zhe froze, tossed the cheque in his hand at Yang Mei-yang, and was about to turn and leave.
Kneeling on the ground, Yang Mei-Yang took hold of Li-Tse's leg and said, "Li-Tse!
Whoa!
Before she could finish, Li Zhe slapped her in the face with a heavy fist and opened her mouth wide.
The little boy next door saw his mother being beaten, ran over to Li Zhi's lap, full of naïve cries, "Daddy!
The boy was born without knowing who his father was, and his mother never told him until she showed him a picture of Li Zhe, and he knew he had a father, and jumped up in joy.
But now he doesn't understand why he doesn't play, and he has to play.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy who was holding his thighs, with disgust, one foot took the little boy and flew out, who is your father, die, you bastard!
The little boy was thrown out on one foot, fell to the ground, his body was crushed, his face was painfully stuck to his stomach, a pain far beyond what a five-year-old boy could bear, unable to bear a large ruby ball that was rolling out of his eyelids.
Wu Meiyu was also surprised, and she quickly released Li Zhe, ran over to hold the little boy, and asked nervously, "Are you okay?"
The little boy looked at his mother's worried expression, closed his mouth, held back his tears, and shook his little head.
Li Zhe did not even look at the mother and daughter, he walked into the iron door, and next to him was a man with white hair like a butler, picked up the check, handed it to Yang Meiyu, and compassionately urged him, "You should keep it!"
She shook her head, holding the boy, and disappeared into the rain.
The housekeeper looked at the mother's back, sighed deeply, turned and went inside, slowly closing the iron door.
Four years later, before his death, Yang Mei-Ming called the boy, who was nine years old and had grown up a lot, to his bedside, gently touched his head, smiled weakly and said, "Son, you can read well later, and then have a good job, and do not resent the Li family, do not resent your father, promise me well?"
The little boy, holding back his tears, nodded seriously.
Looking at the boy nodding his head in agreement, she smiled calmly, and slowly closed her eyes forever.
It was about midnight, and the moon was hanging high in the sky, and the bright moon was shining on the earth, so that there was no darkness around.
The first is the "Humble!"
Suddenly there came a deafening sound from the sky, and he was startled, and looked up to the sky, and saw only the whole sky as if it were burning, transformed into a huge sea of fire, countless scattered seven colors of light, dragging long tails, like meteors, from the sky.
Whoa!
A great sound, a meteorite of seven colors fell in front of the candle, the stinging light made the candle with the hand of the candle, then the strong light spread, a finger-long, two-finger thick crystal quietly floated in the air two meters above the ground.
Curious, the dragon walked up and grabbed the crystal, which was floating in mid-air and was held by the unresponsive dragon.
At this time, the people who were sleeping soundly were awakened by a series of loud noises, opened the doors or opened the windows, looked at the countless crystals floating in mid-air, and began to rush out of the house in a frenzy, snatching the crystals, and then they did not stay long in the place, hurrying back to their own home.
In a single room, the crystal is carefully weighed, if the light is sold, the crystal is not a gem that can be beautiful, if the number is scarce, the value is not even under the city, but the key is too much falling from the sky, let alone tens of billions of the way, so the crystal may not be worth money at all.
The host is detected as a junior intelligence and the soul binding begins...
Oh! the soul is bound to success, and begins to travel to the world of enlightenment.
After this sound, Yang fell to the ground with his eyes blackened. Yang Hong Daili, a 22-year-old orphan, died tragically after saving two children who were about to be hit by a car.
Don't go, don't go, don't go, so I won't go to Hong's house with you to make friends! Dongmu-chan buried his head in his pillow, desperately stepped on the little legs of the white one: Hong-chan's strength is the famous waste of the whole city, and has disgraced the face of their Hong's house, and the elderly sick, twisted, and unable to speak is a standard loser, so I won't look for such a man as my fiancee.
Tang Mu-Yun, the only daughter of the Chairman of the Board of the Dongxi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tang Mu-Yun, the multi-talented, multi-talented, Boguthun now does not say, looks like a flower-like appearance, a niece, a spirit of heaven and earth, especially a handful of good food, a standard up and down the hall, a large bed in the kitchen, and the dream lover of many boys in school.
But today she heard her father say that he would take him to the famous Hong Da Li family to make friends, so how could she bear it: If his parents had not given her a single seedling, he would have been expelled from Hong family long ago, and would have destroyed himself, what chance would there be to go to Hong family?
When she heard this, Don Rui's face on the bedside showed a slightly bitter smile, and he couldn't help but say: "Oh, I can't do it either".
You and Hong Da-li's relationship, which your mother personally decided that year, is not a big deal, even though he lost his family a little.
Don Reus wore a blue-grey leather jacket, inside a white sweater, a simple tie on the collar, a pale bead on the lips, a bronze pipe in his hand, a black short hair with a hint of backwardness, oil shining, the whole figure is quite good, but the eyes of the god who had been worn are now filled with helplessness and reluctance.
If he is not forced to go to the polls, how can he send his own daughter? After all, the great power, a human miracle, the only thing he likes to do or say he will do is two words: loser.
His most famous line was: "Mom, I have to lose my family, so I don't waste the talent my dad earned".
This is a joke that everyone in Tianjin knows and many parents teach their children to say: "If you dare to learn from Hong Da Li, the bastard who broke the family, I will not break your legs!"
So, it is only natural that Don Muang would have such a big reaction.
This is also... Dong-Ryu-Sung frowned and thought, then suddenly his eyes lit up and said: "Oh, what do you think about this? We first decided to wait for Dad's company to return to normal, and then we found an excuse to withdraw the money". This time we were research funding beyond the budget, and once the funding is up, as long as this research project is successful, it will definitely be a big hit in the world, wait for us to slow down, and when we think of ways to withdraw, he should not say anything else, right?
Tan Muang: It's easy for a business to lose its parent, but it's one of the top 500 companies in the world.
I have to say that Tan Mu-ying is a very smart girl.
If she falls, she will not be happy at the end. This is the way the world is, the weak eat the flesh. When you are strong, no one may dare to move you, but when you really fall in the way, people will come and fall down the well.
The first is that she is not a student, but she is a student, and she is not a student, but she is a student.
So Don Muong cried again for a while, and finally realized that there was really no other way but this way, only to climb up against his will: "Well, then try it first, Mom, Dad, in the future you must remember to give up your father, so I don't marry that loser! "
Oh, good, for my family's sake, my father must try to get around. Don Mueang sighed and patted Don Muang's shoulder: Oh, go.
Hong Dail sat on the bed, his eyes dimmed, his mind a mess.
The surroundings were strange, the memory was in a bad way, and now he can only remember the sound of the car's braking, and the rest is a mess that does not belong to him.
I'm not dead, here, where? Looking at his thin, white hands, Hong thought to himself: This is not my body, this is not where I used to live. So, where is this?
He looked around for a moment, and thought: "The first thing to do is to find out what the situation is".
I'm not sure if I'm alive or dead right now. What is this place, who am I? What should I do next?
Now, let's look at the first point. Yang Hong forcefully pressed a small piece of oil skin on the back of his left hand, and it hurt, it hurt: I have a feeling of pain, so I should still be alive.
Then the second question, what is this place, who am I? Hong Hong looked around, the reinforced concrete structure of the house, the snow-white walls, all kinds of modern appliances, and even a computer with a thirty-inch liquid crystal display in the corner of the room:
No one was around, Hong Daili stood up carefully and took a deep breath: "My body is so weak, it's like a bamboo, I don't know when I'll suddenly have a fit".
Opening the computer, Hong opened a few websites, and the content was very different from what he saw on Earth, but at least he understood a few things: first, the world or the country's writing, or the Chinese characters.
I thought about it, but it was soon clear: Well, the age of this body should not be very old, about seventeen or eight years old, the ID card may be done, but it is more likely that it has not been issued yet, after all, this world is different from the Earth, some small differences are normal.
The loser system binding successfully, current rank: Level 1
The first time I heard this, I was surprised to see a little person in my head, who looked like me.
Host name: Hong Da Li
Sexual capacity: 32  Note: The index for normal people is 100
Hong Daili's eyes widened: "What a loser system! is this thing really fake?"
The system's metallic sound came again: "Oh, please explain: for every 100,000 yuan (RMB) lost by the host, one attribute point will be earned".
When all the attributes of the host reach the level of normal people, the system will be upgraded, and new items will be added.
Can you get attribute points? At this point, there is really nothing better than improving your own attribute, Hong Jianli smiled with a frown, can you really get attribute points by defeating the family, so that you become like a normal person?
The sound of the system, although still cold, is now heard in the ear as if it were a song: "Oh, yes, yes".
Hong Da Li almost jumped up from the excitement: "Oh, I'm going to waste!
Next, ask the host to complete the first task: First loser. Mission requirement: At least 100,000 yuan for the loser by 0:00 midnight today.
The current loser amount: 0
Oh, I'm sorry, it's already eight o'clock at night! It's only four hours to go, no, I'm going out! I'm going to lose my house!
Just thinking about it, the door of the room was opened, and a maid of about forty years came in with a slight jerk and said softly: "Young master, the master and the lady let you in, please come with me".
"You're going to buy me a game of poker?" asked the owner, who was eager to see what he could do.
You're in high school now, you can't be so obsessed with games like you used to be!
This is a game that has been created by the famous company for 13 years, called the Second World of Mankind!
The game called "The Shining Star" is indeed another innovation in human history, not only is it an example of virtual reality games, with a near-percent accuracy, but also through a new technology that allows players to experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night.
This game is being promoted by the whole country! it's not a scam, this game not only doesn't affect learning, but also allows people to rest better!
The Chinese are not going to give up on us.
"I'm telling you for the last time, no! If you don't go back to your room to do your homework in twenty seconds, you'll have a fifty percent cut in your allowance for the next month!" the boss said with a face full of tears.
You are stubborn!
The voice of the old man was low and low, but he also knew that there was nothing to talk about, the conditions in his own home were good, the old man was absolutely not forced to buy this game, but the old man's brain was rigid, he absolutely did not believe that playing the game would not affect learning!
The next lesson started and when the teacher left, a fat little boy came up behind him and asked, holding his shoulder.
Don't even think about it, I won't be able to play with you this time!
The brothers are all pointing at you!
Little Fat Man, Zhao Feng, said, "This little fat man is one of the few friends of Zhao Fei at school, and Zhao Fei's high school class is the school's focus class, but Zhao Fei's grades are average, his grades are not up or down, he is not good at sports, and he is not very good at interpersonal communication, so he is definitely a standard transparent person".
I'm not sure what to do, but I'm not sure what to do, because I don't know what to do.
"I'm not sure if the brothers have the money to buy you one", said Yang, "because they're the same type of guys who don't do well in all aspects, so the relationship between the two transparent people who are not the focus of teachers and classmates is very good".
The song is about a man who is in a coma.
I wish!
The peak nodded.
Since childhood, Liu Fei has loved to play games, especially the virtual reality games, as a boy, who does not want to fight with sword walkers?
But this time, Liu Fei was hopeless, since he was promoted to high school, Liu Fei was placed under a restraining order by his boss, all the gaming equipment in his house was seized, and online gaming was out of the question!
It was only about six in the evening, but because it was already winter, it was dark very early.
Thinking that today was the day of the lightning disguise, Liu Feifei locked himself in his room with a cold. It was almost ten o'clock, and Liu Fei had finished his homework, and he lay on his back in his bed, looking at the clock on the wall at one o'clock, which was approaching ten o'clock, and something was not in his heart.
The opening time of the game is 10pm today, and then it will run for eight hours from 10pm to 6am the next day, not only without delaying the player's normal life, but also allowing the player to experience the full 24 hours of game time!
The ring on the index finger is rubbed with the hand while the ring is being rubbed with the hand.
What the hell is this?
The old man's mouth was open, and he was speechless, looking at the ring that was emitting a faint light from his hand.
Whoa!
A white light flashed, a flower flew before my eyes, and when I could see clearly again, it was no longer my room!
Hello, welcome to the world of the bright and shining!
A crisp female voice reaching into the ears of the flying!
This is the landing interface for the Phantom?
"It's a character-created interface", the new assistant replied.
I'm not sure if it's because I'm a fan of the game or because it's hard to imagine that I'm not a fan of the game, but how can I get into the game?
Maybe it's your dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream! Maybe it's your own dream!
You are a liar, you are a liar!
A furious roar followed by the sound of a fleeing footstep on the asphalt floor.
Zhang waved his hands in frustration: "I'm not a liar, I'm a teacher at the university... I just want you to be my student!"
After the ceremony, Zhang remembered what the head of the political department had said, and he frowned: "It's the 17th! If I can't admit even one student today, I can go home tomorrow!"
Zhang Zhenbo is not a person of this world, but an ordinary university librarian on Earth, remembering only the big fire, and then... there was no more then, and he woke up again in this world.
The story is almost like a novel, where the hero is the hero, and the hero is the hero.
I thought I could walk through a piece of wood, get divorced, then fight back, sing all the way... I thought I could do more, but when I got here, I found out that I was not a student, but... a teacher!
The most mourned teacher in the whole school!
The other classrooms were full of people, crowded to the point of being unable to sit down, while his classroom, which was empty, was not easy to be pulled in by him, and in the end he even yelled at the cheater, turned around and ran away!
The reason is that the guy who is possessed by his own soul, the weakest of the teachers, is also very poorly sighted, can't see the pupils, the key... and teaches wrong, there is an example of going to hell!
He was as ill as a dead man, and was despised and rejected, and even the newly-comes were a great fear, lest they should fall into his hands, and be taught that he was half dead and not alive.
The school had no students, suffered from a lack of discipline, and last year's teacher evaluation, the entire school was ranked first, even getting the only zero in its history.
He is sad, borrowed, and sad, and he is hanging on to what he wants, and he is borrowing his way through.
The new semester began, and the college issued a final warning that if he could not enroll another student in his class this year, he would be dismissed from the faculty!
Today, 17 new students walked past his classroom, and as a result, as soon as they heard the name, they all ran away, like a little girl running into a monster, or how fast she ran.
It seems like you have to find a way to ignore one of them!
I was thinking about how to open the door, when I saw a dumb girl with a dumb face coming out of the door.
I'm sorry, but this is the classroom of Lu Zi's teacher.
The voice is sweet, the face is clean, the face is beautiful.
The classroom was always packed with students, and many of them were very popular.
And behold, there was a man casting a net for his life, and his eyes were bright.
He recalled all the ways of the world he had seen before, and sat quietly on the throne, and gave the appearance of a man of nobility: "Do you want to call him Master?"
The girl nodded her head like a sparrow, and her dark eyes were filled with adoration: "I heard that Lu Ziyi was the best teacher at Hong Tian Academy, and the students he taught, each one of them was exceptional, and everyone was proud to join his class!"
If you don't get along with your theory, you won't progress, and if you don't get along with your theory, you'll fall behind. If your teacher isn't famous, you can make rapid progress and improve your theory.
I've heard my brother say something similar! the girl nodded, the beautiful pair of eyes were a bit confused: "Oh, but I don't know what kind of classroom I'm in!"
Seeing her up and down, Zhang raised his eyes and hesitated, and Marx, Enkos and other pioneers appeared in his mind, making a difficult appearance: "You meet each other, that's it, I am also a teacher at this college, I can help you see the roots, talents, and integrity for free, and help you recommend a suitable teacher!
The teacher, who was not expected to meet her, was so generous that the girl nodded her head excitedly.
I'm not sure how to do this, but I'm sure you'll be able to do it.
Zhang's eyes were half closed, and he didn't seem to care.
Oh, yeah!
The world is full of people who are not happy.
The moment of kung fu, the blowing of the fist in the room, the air that flows like a dragon on the girl, the whole person's breath, the concentration of the air, the absence of the air, the absence of the air, represented her excellent foundation.
I see that you are a hard worker, with a solid foundation, a brilliant talent, and a rare genius!
He is studying with the Master of Earthly Destiny, and the words are all gold and silver, wide ranging, so that one cannot hear the error, but is accurate.
Teacher, I have a wound in my leg, and the doctor says it's almost gone... The girl interrupted him, and there was some doubt in his eyes.
The wounded... the old man's face was red, but his face was thick, so that no one could see it, and he continued to rant: "Did you think I didn't see it? I knew it when you were just trying to be strong!
But they were all amazed at his words, for he spoke not without reason. Then the other disciple also spoke,
What chance? Teacher, what chance? The girl's eyes lit up.
After her leg was injured, she felt inferior to others, and lived in a low self-esteem, not thinking that she could still be blessed by the misfortune.
This chance, you can make you fly to the sky, to be the first newborn is not enough, after all, your talent is good, is the ultimate genius of all time, but...
When she heard that she could be the first born, and that she was a genius, she couldn't help but look hot and asked: "But what?
But... Yang Zhang sighed, and a good teacher who was about to be buried said: "There are not many teachers in the whole school who can see this kind of chance!"
The girl, who had high hopes, looked a little pale at the words, and then jumped up and said: "They don't accept students, so you... don't accept them?"
I'll pay you back, but as you can see, I'm not very good at it, and I don't have much time!
The phone is ringing!
When he had finished speaking, she knelt down and said, "Sir, I know that you are a man of integrity. Please accept me as your servant so that I may do my duty and not cause your teacher any embarrassment".
The students assured him that they would not be bothered by him, and that they would not disturb him!
I have few students, I may not have the resources to be a teacher, and I will be criticized...
I heard that exercise is important... the girl hesitated.
The resources that teachers receive at the academy are tied to many conditions, such as the number of students and the number of grades that they teach, and if the resources are not enough, it will be difficult to progress in the cultivation.
I said this to test you, since you are firm in your heart, and sincerely consider me a teacher, I will also find it difficult to take you back. Seeing her hesitation, Zhang immediately interrupted, and hurriedly said: "Verify your identity".
Oh, this... this soon?
The teacher's face changed like a book, the girl was slightly surprised, and after the card was passed, she was thinking about whether to verify it or not, and then the teacher, who had been lying there before, pulled her hand, took out a sharp knife and scratched it, and a drop of blood fell on the card.
What a surprise!
The light is flickering.
The girl is stunned.
The teacher didn't say to think about it, did he? How did he move so fast, and... is the knife ready?
From now on, you are my student! (a drop of blood confirms the decision) Zhang Xiu is relieved and regains his high-mindedness: What's your name?
I'm Wang Yi, and my name is Wang Yi.
The girl stopped talking, knowing that she could not change, and nodded her head.
Hey, take your ID card, go get your blankets, books, and find your own place. Tomorrow is official school, come here and find me!
Zhang with his hands in the air.
Oh yes! Oh yes! The king nodded, turned around and walked away.
You missed the last one!
When she became one of his students, Zhang Xiu was relieved and smiled.
It's not easy, and if it wasn't for the many fake techniques I've seen on the internet, I'm afraid it would be very difficult to succeed today.
One student, who was spared the fate of being expelled, relaxed under the suspense, suddenly felt that the whole person's spirit was smoothed out for a moment, and the little obsessions that were circulating in his mind about the previous person were also slowly disappearing.
Rest assured, once it's inside you, it'll be alive and well for you!
The previous hang died because he could not recruit students, more or less, at this moment there are students, the last persistence also disappeared without a trace, until this moment, the hang is completely mastered by this body.
The sound of thunder!
After completing the physical examination, Zhang Hsing-Jung tried to ignore the next few students, but felt a tremor in his brain, and the sound of a yellow bell tower resounded.
The sound of thunder!
The mysterious language, the trembling of his head, the tears, and then the thought of a huge palace, on which five letters were shining.
The library of heaven!
The door was pushed in, and there were countless shelves, and books of all kinds, endless, and the eye could not see the end.
Nimah, I'm a librarian for life, and I'm not going to be born, either!
The big gift of others, not the boss, is the system, all kinds of good things that are forced to explode, but he is a library, Zhang Xiu only feels that the darkness is in front of him, he almost did not pass out.
The library? The bird? Shall we fight later, and others throw swords, and I throw books?
What kind of books are these?
Desperate, Zhang reached for the books on the shelves to see if the library was really useful, but he found that his hand went straight through the shelves and grabbed an empty one.
What do you mean, you're kidding me? Give a library and you can't get any books, you can't read them, what do you want to do?
Zhang's face was covered with tears.
Chapter 1
What about my tattoo?
He opened his sleeve and looked at his two white and soft cheeks in amazement. Before, his cheeks were marked with two fangs and claws, a green dragon with a full breath!
How... all gone?
Lifting his head, Yang Yu found himself sitting in a brightly lit office with small partitions in front and behind.
At this moment, the phone is ringing non-stop, paper documents are flying around, and more than a dozen office workers are moving around the hall in a hurry, all of them looking like a bunch of hotheads.
At this time, a middle-aged man in a brown shirt came quickly and greeted the crowd, and the head of the bending band is now telling you about the case of the electric baton rape, which is going to be carried out tonight, listen up!
The first thing I noticed was that the people were very happy with the newly installed system, and the new system was very much like the old system.
When the greeting was heard, many of the staff rushed over the fence, pulled out their chairs and sat down in front of the whiteboard to listen intently.
The jade did not move, but remained seated on its own seat.
At this moment, he was still in a state of shock, and he touched his right ear, which was intact.
When he looked in the mirror, he saw a picture on his desk. It was a young, handsome man in a police uniform, who looked exactly like him!
Grandma Bear! To his surprise, a strange memory flooded his mind like the Yellow River.
He remembers very well that he was the golden medalist of the Jinlong Gang, a monkey king who fought and did not die! Although his real name is Liu Yue, but the people in Yangtze Lake prefer to call him Liu Xianqi!
Grandma the bear!
Once again, he was shocked, and he finally remembered that he had been executed by lethal injection before!
But, remember... how did you get here?
Did I really cross the border?
And yet, there is no connection, no rebirth at all?
As new memories flood in, he is surprised to discover that this is a parallel world to the one before, and his current identity is that of a Special Forces agent, a crooked cop!
Now he is in this hall, nowhere else, but in the office of the police station!
The difference between the two is so huge that it's hard to imagine. A senior kid who's turned into a major crime agent is... how can that be?
He unconsciously touched his head, and before that he had a big bald head, like a cruel, evil hair, because he had been cut several times on the head, and his hair had always grown unevenly. But now he had a beautiful black hair, and he looked like a handsome boy.
Dear colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been three cases of electric baton rape in my city... At this moment, a short-haired, big-eyed female agent is telling the story to the crowd.
She is the leader of the B team of the heavy crime group, regardless of her age, but she is a solid character, with a high rate of solving cases, and is the red man in front of the leader. In general, any major case that requires the cooperation of the whole team will be presided by her.
The victims were young women who dressed up and had poor lifestyle. According to the leader of the gang, the gangs were mostly located near bars and music halls, and the crime was committed after midnight.
According to the victim's account, the perpetrator followed the victim into a tunnel, electrocuted her with an electrical cord, and then raped her. After the crime, the perpetrator also spat on the victim.
The scene was quiet after hearing the words "Pussy piss" and "Pussy piss".
He looked at the man, and it was the deputy captain of the crime squad, Chief Liu Huang. During his training, he was a member of the Wu family, and every day he was asked to pour tea, just like the messenger who called the next person.
In this world, however, the "Jungle" is not a king of monkeys, but a big boy with a weak character who has just finished his internship and has become a full-fledged police officer.
Now the yucca is not a soft candy, how did it get drunk by people? He slapped the table and stood up.
His sudden rise startled the tiger, and even the leader of the band had to pause.
And behold, as all the people were turning to the candle, a woman's voice like a silver thorn suddenly came to the candle. Only a girl with a horse's tail, thin and fat, and wearing large glasses, appeared before the eyes of the people.
The girl is a newly assigned intern in the Major Crimes Unit, named Li Beini. This girl is a flower girl, and she has been dead for less than a month.
Although the character of the jade is weak, often bullied, it looks like a talent, a head of 1.78 meters, a jade tree, young and energetic, and a certain killing power for the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing that the person she loves is being drunk by the people, Li Beini hurried to the front and said: "Hey Captain, I'm coming, I'm coming!
After that, Li Bin shook her head and smiled, then ran to the tea room in the hall to pour coffee.
He was able to sit back and continue to ponder the question of his own crossing. Although he did, his memory was very clear, as he had been lying on the death row chair just a few minutes earlier.
However, he knew that he was being set up, not murdered. The man who was killed was the owner of a real estate group, and he could not have killed him by simply beating him at the direction of his superiors.
And if he really did strike him to death, it was manslaughter, and he shouldn't be convicted of murder. So his death was a conspiracy.
Think of these things, and the fire of anger will fill the mouth of the Yang Yi, and his fist will be shrill. If the people who have betrayed him are found later, they will surely pay them double.
By this time, Li Beini had already prepared the coffee and distributed a cup to each of the colleagues present. The girl's face was full of enthusiasm, and every time she served a cup, she would kindly encourage a word that she had worked hard to fill the oil pan with oil, etc., to win the colleagues' favor.
Officer, this cup has two packets of sugar in it! It's supposed to be a night of drinking, but you'll have to hold on!
Li Beini, who was waiting for a response from the Yue Yue, put the plate down and left.
At this time, the head of the Kuang Group had finished the case, and a member of the heavy crime group, Captain Jin Zhenbang, spoke.
Captain Kim shouted that there have been three cases of electrocution of the staff, and if there are more, it will be classified as a series of incidents.
So, let's all work together to solve this case in the shortest possible time! So... A team sent a team to the scene of the crime to investigate, since the perpetrator was following the victim, he must have appeared in the bar where the victim was before, and he must have called out all the surveillance there, and he must have found this person!
Oh, yeah!
Team B, you are the ones who are responsible for the evidence! Captain Ming ordered that the murderer has no case, the blood line is not going to go. However, the murderer's urine is an important clue, although the police can not find a match, but you can go to the hospital or the medical examination center to check the evidence, as long as the person has done a physical examination or stayed in the hospital, you can definitely find him!
Oh, yeah!
The police are also looking for clues to the murderer's identity, including the electrical rods used by the perpetrator, the mobile phone signal at the scene, and the only known victim who could have seen the perpetrator's face.
Oh, yeah!
All right, let's have a plan of action for each group, and if there's no problem, then let's go as soon as possible.
Wait, I have a problem!
When they heard this, they turned around and saw a man speaking to them. He was a carpenter.
Captain Kim was also a little nervous, and asked: "What's wrong with you, Yu Yu? What's wrong with you?"
He pointed to his forehead and said, "I'm not feeling well, go home and play".
Chapter 1
In the 21st century, the office of the director of the senior private hospital in Donghai City.
The president of the hospital was very angry and angry, but Mr. Lee, who is one of the directors of Ling Yun Group, who owns 40 percent of our hospital, you must give him priority to get the poison out!
Faced with the anger of the dean, Han Jian-Yang put his hands in the pockets of the white building, very calmly.
She is a beautiful, clean-looking woman with big eyes and a pair of small pears. She is known for her incredible acupuncture skills in the Chinese medical community. She is a rare expert in detoxification.
The dean was furious and started shooting.
Stop talking about doctors who treat everyone equally, only men and women. Han Jian-Yang, I tell you, arrange detoxification now, or else, from today, get out of the medical profession!
I thought that Han Jian-Yang would be afraid, but she was still calm and serious, and the dean of the jungle, there was no difference between men and women in front of me, there were only two types of people, those I wanted to save and those I didn't want to save, Mr. Li I didn't save, please ask Gao Ming!
She finished, smiled politely, turned and walked away, looking as if she was thin and elegant, and had a kind of arrogance that could not be ignored. However, when Yang Han-jeong opened the door, the dean of the forest was furious.
You dare to speak to me like that, you're making me stand up!
As she said this, the case on the table was thrown back over her head, and Han Jian looked at it, only to feel a warm, wet feeling slowly flowing from the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, the Kingdom of Tianjin.
Han Jian-Yang woke up from the flower bed, and heard a cheerful sound, and the sound of the drums and the trumpets, and the blackness in front of him.
What's going on?
Han Jian-Yang, who had a hood over her head, looked down and breathed coldly, "Is this... is this not Shipa?"
The flowers were blooming, causing Han Jian to have a headache, and at this time, a strange memory flooded her mind.
The original owner was the niece of the medical family of the Han family in Tiananmen, also called Han Jian, because the maternal medicine saved the life of the then queen, that is, the current lady, was appointed as the wife of the seven princes of the time, that is, the current King of the Yang Dynasty, and was also passed on as a good story, and the status of the Han family also rose.
But no one knows that Han Jian-Yang was born a good-for-nothing girl, and grew up to be a wasteful ugly woman who did not know medicine, so the marriage was delayed and delayed and became a taboo for the Emperor.
The younger of the two, the only one who is still alive, is the only one who is still alive, and the only one who is still alive.
The royal palace of the Zhou family was to the south of the city, the Han family to the north, and the flower family was to pass through the city from north to south. The Zhou king married, and although he did not appear in public, he was followed by the people, and the whole city was in a state of commotion.
Just as Han Jian-Yang was putting together these memories, she stopped cheering, and only heard Shiba's shouts, "It's not good, it's not good, it's not good!"
Chapter One
Yo-Yo, Yo-Yo, get up. It's almost zero, get up and eat some coconut.
He was confused, but he answered in a vague voice, opened his eyes, and saw a young face that existed only in his memory.
What's wrong?
I woke up, went to wash my face. I said don't drink, you have to drink, go to sleep without even looking at it.
Is it Christmas Eve or is it New Year's Eve?
He looked to the right and left of the maze of temples, to a small house of less than six square meters, a single bed with patched blankets, an old wooden table, topped with a twenty-watt white brick lamp, radiating a faint light, and old newspapers on the wall, all of which he had forgotten about some of the country's important events.
This is not the old house on his family's farm when he was a child, but it was demolished long ago when the town was built, and how did his sister get so young?
He raised his hand, and realized that it was not a joke, because his hand was getting smaller and his arm was getting thinner.
He jumped out of bed and stood on the door frame with the mark he makes with a knife every New Year's Day, the top row, 1988, 166 cm.
It's 1988 and he hasn't finished his junior high school yet?
He stroked himself with his hands, and cried out in pain, "Is this not a dream?"
He opened the door and saw his mother cooking a duck in the kitchen at the front. He lived in a small house, which was the kitchen on the outside, and the living room on the other side, which was called the farmhouse.
He got up and drank more wine.
The mother, with her dark hair and wet eyes, looked at the child.
You've worked hard.
What do you say, child? Wash your face, go home and watch TV, you'll be fine. Zhang Zhao Hua heard that hard, and his heart was very happy, his son is grown up.
When Liu Yu saw his father sitting on a living room bench, his lips were moving. Just when he was able to earn money in the future, his father was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and died less than three months later, without even spending a penny of his salary.
The family is still in the process of rearing their son, but the family is still struggling to cope with the loss of their son, and it has been difficult for the family for a long time.
Dad: You're up, aren't you tired? Watch TV, the national dance is great, it's a happy day.
I'm going to have a drink with you, Dad. I see my father's face, and I'm going to have a beer.
After not having had a few drinks with him in his life, he now has a strong desire to have another drink with him.
I don't remember much, so go, have another drink, I'll see you can get up tomorrow and go to New Year's! No! Dan Ying, go get two bottles of beer.
He shook his head helplessly, turned to get the beer and the glass.
The house also has a single bed with a blanket on it. Fudan Yin went to school and stayed with her mother in the house during her holidays. This bed is where she sleeps.
The living room has a three-door vertical wardrobe with two leather boxes on top. A fourteen-inch black and white television is on a solid wooden table, and the TV is showing Spring Evening.
In the middle of the living room there is a folding round table, on which there are already full of dishes and bowls. There are eight dishes in total, but all are leftovers of the evening. There are soups with fish and elbows, eight dishes are all soups, not a single dish.
Instead of watching TV, Liu Yu went to the front of the wardrobe and took a careful picture in front of the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the doorway, February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve.
He can now be sure that he is reborn!
Soon after, the mother cooked the soup, and both Liu Yu and Fudan Ying went to the kitchen to help her put the soup on the table. After the four of them sat down, Liu Xingtai picked up the soup.
You're drinking too, Yang Xiaoyue! Yang Zhang Zhaohao looked at the temple.
Oh, next year, let me have another drink.
Zheng Zhengtai also said two words, and Zhang Zhenhua shook his head and left with them. The temple also poured a glass of beer for his mother and sister, who also served in the temple.
Happy New Year to you, my dearest sister and father!
The leftovers on the table, Liu Yu ate a bite, and all felt especially good. This year, there are no hormonal additives in the afterlife. Fish, ducks and everything is wild, chickens and pigs are raised by themselves.
And when he had eaten and washed, he came to his own house, and lay down in his bed, and turned on his side, and thought of the former life.
Mr. Liu is a middle-aged man in his forties who has made a little investment of his own after resigning from the securities company.
A wife, no children, father died young, mother lives with him.
He remembers that in the spring of 2015, he wanted to take his wife abroad for infertility treatment and make some extra money, so he put all the savings in the house, including the house and car, into mortgages, borrowed a lot of money, and put it all into the stock market, which, according to his judgment, was a bull market, and rabbits could make money.
The situation started off very well, his investment soon doubled. So he boldly used high leverage in an investment company, wanting to make more profit, and then doubled again, he did nothing for the rest of his life, and could eat without worry.
When the stock market rose to 5,000, he, like many people, greedy he thought he could continue to rise, the stock market did rise a little, but the stock market soon came to a head, because he used high leverage, and no additional funds, but instead lost a lot of money. After paying off the borrowed money, he became a poor man, his wife did not know the house and car had been mortgaged out, he did not know how to go home to face his family.
He went bankrupt, drank a lot that day, and then deliberately, in full view of many people, accidentally fell on the road and was hit by a big truck.
This should not be considered suicide, he took out accident insurance, which should have paid him millions, enough to buy back the house and car, and leave a sum of money to his mother and wife.
He remembers looking at the big truck that was coming, and thinking that if God gave him a chance to come back, he wouldn't die so capriciously, he would give his family a comfortable life!
But what I didn't expect was that God had actually given him a chance to come back!
Now that God has brought him back, there will be no regrets in this life. He will become a billionaire, he will become a legend in the investment world!
"Don't cry, go to sleep".
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Zhaohao shouted. At the same time, complaining about her husband, how he let her son drink at night, it was nonsense.
Hearing his mother's complaints, Liu Yi laughed, turned around, and fell asleep.
The video was posted on May 20, 2019
Spring is over and summer is over.
This season, the temperature varies greatly between day and night in the Jiangnan region. During the day, the dogs are dressed in a hot coat; at night, they are shrouded in a cold coat.
The city of Jiangnan University.
He was alone in his dorm, and the computer table was pulled to the side of his bed so he could watch movies in various postures.
The book was written by a man who had been a student of the school of the famous Japanese writer, and was written by a man who had been a student of the school of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and was a student of the famous Japanese writer, and a student of the famous Japanese writer.
In the middle of the night, the temperature dropped sharply. He was only a small book under his body, and he was struggling to navigate, his hands in his sleep were groping in bed, looking for the book, but he could not touch the quilt. Finally, he only shrunk into a skin-like shell, shivering under the sensual heat of the midnight cold wind.
As the sun rose, she became a member of the seasonal flu army.
His roommate has already taken a leave of absence from class today.
Then he took cold medicine and slept until now.
He was very hot and had a fever, and his body was still a little weak, so he couldn't go to school at all. So he could only stay in his dorm room alone and watch boring movies.
The film's screenplay is slowly moving forward, but the content of the film is not seen at all by Liu.
He sighed and felt a heavy tinge in his eyelids.
The chat software in the lower right corner of the computer is beating.
This is a suggestion to add him as a friend or join the group.
The message pops up when he reaches for the lower right corner of the computer's touch screen.
[Huan Shan Shan] Please add you as a friend. Additional message: No.
Who is this strange nickname?
Is she a classmate? She is obsessed with books, and can't help but think of the classmates who have gone to college but are still in their teenage fantasies. If it were them, they would have used this strange nickname.
He nodded his head and agreed.
The next thing I know, another system message pops up.
[Huan Shan Yan invites you to join the group of the first group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group]
The company has continued to operate with the consent of the owner.
The pressure dam in Suzuka agreed to join the first group of the Kyushu Dam.
[You have agreed to join the group, so say hello to the members!] There is also a system smile.
The chat tool has become more and more human this year.
After a series of pop-up tips, Liu Shuoyuan turned off the tips and group chat window, and now he's sleepy, where is the energy to manage what group he added?
Anyway, his group settings are always the same: no message prompts, only the number bars, and the group chats don't pop up to bother him, only the number of chats after the group.
After he wakes up, he can look through the chat logs to see which group he is in, and the chat logs of the group members will not be lost.
The film's plot is still going strong, but the book's consciousness is becoming more and more vague.
In the group of the first group of Kyushu, after seeing new members join, the group started with the diving members. North River Squirrel: Did Mr. Zhuang Yanshan add a new friend?
ID also quickly responded to Ms. Zhao's question: "Do you have a new friend? What district is your friend from?"
What do you think is wrong with this whole series of questions?
Is it a fairy? Yes, it is a fairy, light a candle!
Are you really a goldfish, Mr. Yang? The people of the North River said, "You'll die again, but what if Mr. Huang really comes back with a big throne?"
This guy is all good, sympathetic, helpful, so it's good to be a person who usually likes to talk, and do a good job.
The only one who is guilty of this is the big frontman, who is always guilty of killing people every time he is killed. These big frontmen with their eggs aching are sad and unhappy, and naturally they are happy to fold the crazy sword three waves to the door.
I kneel down and beg not to mention the words of the great leader, there is a shadow in this heart. The three waves of the mad sword send a row of tears filled with tears.
Four years ago, he was beaten up by a beautiful, big, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, was the fat was the man who was beaten
And when he had said these things, there arose two or three of them in the midst of the multitude, which were without hiding their faces, and laughed, saying, Blessed be the blessing! and cursed be the cursing!
The group showed eight people online, six of whom were shown with a row of smiles.
Oh, you guys who are lucky and miserable, this meeting remembers each of you, do not let this meeting happen to you, otherwise you must taste the suffering of this seventy-two-way razor!
The three waves of the blade were just finished.
He is a master of the five-spirit queen, and is only two steps away from the six-spirit king, but he can only play A-7.
He is a quick and sharp 72-gauge swordsman, and a lightning-fast bodybuilder, but he can only hit A-7.
He called it the mad sword, and when he got mad, he was afraid of himself, but he could only hit the A7.
The crowd saw the three waves disappear, and there was another row of innocent smiles.
This time, the three waves of the blade will only be able to make a series of melancholy exclamations.
The crowd was silent for half a day, but no newcomer was heard, some doubted.
"What is the meaning of this?" asked the stranger in the North River.
Unfortunately, because of the effects of the cold medicine, the ship has again entered a semi-dormant state.
At that moment, Su Shih-Chi was happy to send a message: "I see that the new Taoist friends call the Tao Shushun Pressure Tower.
I remember that the people who walk in the shrine are more relaxed than the Buddhists, not only do they have a hard mouth, but their fists are also hard enough. And when they hit the shrine, they also sing a glorious chant to make it more exciting and refreshing!
I said, "A-ha-ha, do you expect your new friends to be only good and bad, and not good enough to fight?"
I'm sorry to hear that.
The video was posted on the social media site of the Chinese government's Ministry of Education and Culture, and the video was posted on the social media site of the Ministry of Education and Culture.
The first thing that came to mind when I read this is that the film is about a man who is a child and he is a child.
Yes, almost four years ago, it seems that there was a predecessor who was shut down after more than a hundred years, also not easy to get on the chat software, joined by Huang Shanqiang.
Then a guy named Ranger Three Waves was very happy to talk to the forward, and asked the forward to report the three waves, and ask her to send photos, and to voice chat with her.
Then... a few days later, the three waves of the sword saw the forerunner with their own eyes. It was a beautiful forerunner, as beautiful as the moon in the night sky.
And then, after a year and four months of fighting the three waves of the sword, the beautiful striker left with a satisfied heart.
The first time I heard this, I was shocked.
The message is so short and so strange, it never ends.
The people in the crowd were used to the pharmacist's short chatter, and he was asking where the master of the crowd, Huang Shan, was.
The shortness of speech is not the character of the pharmacist, but because he typed with two fingers Zen plus handwriting, the speed was slow. When there are many words, it is easy to make mistakes, and the pain of writing is incomparable. Therefore, the pharmacist is accustomed to speaking short and short.
He was immediately disconnected after he added people, and heard that his beloved big demon dog had left his house again, and Huang Sanxiang went after him again.
I'm not sure I'm ready to go.
I can only wait until my new friends learn to use the chat tool to talk.
They all came first, thinking that the newcomers were also their comrades in the middle.
After about an hour, she regained consciousness.
Remember when someone added me to their group, as if to call me Kyushu Group 1? He whispered, and then opened the chat tool in the lower right corner, and pulled out the chat window of Kyushu Group 1.
What kind of group is this?
Soon, the record of the conversation from an hour ago appeared before him.
The book is about a trip by the Chinese writer Liu Shikai.
The big dog chase?
The following is a list of words related to the various Marvel Comics characters.
The way the people in the group talk is also very interesting, half old, half white. It gives the impression that modern people try to communicate in ancient languages, biased because the foundations of ancient languages are not equal, resulting in a very different way of communication.
The book is about a young girl who is a student of the Chinese school of Chinese.
It looks like this is a group of Marvel fans?
This is no ordinary Marvel fan club!
Each of the people in the group has a name for their street, and the place where they live is called the Cave, and the lost pet dogs of the owners of the group are all described as the big demon dog in the family who left the house.
The only thing that is not a shame is to look at the chat logs.
This obsession with the sea has reached the level of the secondary disease, and it is the second of the fairy tales with a very characteristic Warashi.
It looks like a concentration camp for the sick in Wonderland!
This is his first impression of the first group of monkeys and their members.
But why include him?
He looked at the profile of the head of the group, Huang Shanxiang, who was not his classmate, and he certainly did not know him.
The thin blue lines extend smoothly from the bottom of the pencil point. The pale blue lines on the large card are increasing, gradually, a complex pattern of the background becomes more perfect with the sliding of the pencil point.
Suddenly, the pencil sharpened, and the lightness of the pencil changed, followed by a sharp side edge, the pencil sharp as a knife! The pattern on the card suddenly lit up, then faded quickly, and returned to normal.
He is still focused on his face, and has only completed fifteen, ten more than today's task. He is now working on a one-star energy card, which is the lowest level of energy cards, and is one of the most widely used and most consumed cards.
The room was suddenly dark.
The number 100 is on the dial. The energy is gone, and it seems that today's task will add another one. Back at the desk, Chen Zhongxun throws himself into work, his entire livelihood depends on this most paper-grade card.
The room is small, less than forty square meters, and there is a half-old work table. In addition to the work table is still relatively clean, the room is piled up everywhere else like a pile of garbage. These garbage is also five flowers and eight doors, piles of old books, scattered various raw materials.
This is a special relief house provided by the federal government, and a small room like this can be rented for only one hundred and fifty OD each month. For poor people like Chen Zhong, there is no place cheaper than here.
At 5pm, Chen Zhong finally finished his work for the day with 25 energy cards. After carefully counting the number of cards, he counted them twice in a row to make sure that the number was correct and then carefully put the energy cards in the bag of his clothes.
As he entered the door, the owner of the store noticed him and greeted him: "Aao Aao!
He answered the owner of the shop. Uncle Hua, the owner of the shop, was an old man in his fifties, who had left an indelible mark on him.
Chen Chen carefully took the card from his hand, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed them to the owner: "Twenty-five".
Uncle Hu took the card from Chen Zhong's hand, didn't look at it, put it on the shelf, and laughed and said: "Thank you for sending me cards every day, otherwise I would have a shortage of supplies here".
Chen Xiang smiled, but didn't answer, he knew that what Wang Hao said was mostly meant as a joke. The one-star energy card is the cheapest energy card, but also one of the most consumed, and moreover, here is located near Dongwei University, where only twenty-five energy cards can be sold a day?
Uncle Wang also knew Chen Zhong's temper, and didn't say anything stupid, but asked directly: "Does Yang A Zhong need cash or a transfer?"
Chen Zhong simply replied, and after saying this, he handed a light green decal to Uncle Hua that had been prepared for him. After finishing his farewell to Uncle Hua, Chen Zhong wanted to turn around and leave.
He suddenly called Chen Zhong: "Wait for me".
Chen Zhong stopped, turned around and looked at Uncle Hua with a look of surprise: "Is there something wrong with you?"
Uncle Hu took out a yellow paper from the drawer and smiled at Chen Zhong: "You almost forgot something". This is a certificate for a cardmaker training class that was delivered by the dealer yesterday when we ordered.
He knew how much the old man had helped him over the years, and if it hadn't been for him, he believed that life would be just as unattainable for him.
Three years ago, he had just learned to make energy cards and sold them everywhere, but no one asked him about it, and no businessman wanted to buy them. The amount of energy cards required for a one-star rating was very large, and businessmen prefer to order a large number of them.
Luckily, he met Uncle Wang. Wang agreed to buy his energy cards, but each card was purchased for 103 OED, two OED less than the wholesale price of energy cards on the market.
Although the price of 103 ODIs was lower than the price of 105 ODIs, Chen Zhong felt surrounded by great joy. He sold all the energy cards he had and bought the cheapest food, and the rest of the money was used to buy the ingredients for the energy cards.
Since then, Chen's life has finally stabilized.
He has been doing 25 energy cards a day, without a day off.
This time, it was three years. In those three years, he only made one card, a one-star energy card. In addition to making energy cards, he spent all his time researching how to reduce costs.
Finally, in the third year, the cost of the energy card was controlled by him at 95 OD, and he could earn 8 OD for each energy card, and his daily income was stable at 200 OD, which was a figure he could not have imagined three years ago.
Uncle Chen Zhongxiao, who had returned to the Lord, smiled and said: "Thank you, Uncle Hua! You received the lecture card and carefully put it in the briefcase in your arms".
They often advertise in a very glamorous way, for example, what is said on the certificate of the university that recognizes the university's senior senior master of the university, the authoritative person who speaks to the university, and what is actually in it. The only thing that the institution that conducts this training has to do with the university is that the institution must pay a fee to the university every time to maintain the joint organization of the university.
Chen Zhong still intends to listen to what is being said in the training class. Cardmaking is one of the hardest subjects to learn, and he has not given up on self-study for so many years, but it has had little effect.
For a youngster with no foundation, it is difficult to learn the hard-won art of cardmaking. However, he has no doubts about his intelligence, and can learn to make a star-class energy card in a week with only memory, and the cardmaker praised his talent.
Since then, he has abandoned this temporarily overwhelming goal and turned to the most basic theoretical learning. Every day, no matter how tired he is from work, he takes time to learn these tedious knowledge.
After saying goodbye to Uncle Hua, Chen Zhong walked south along a small road. Today is Saturday, and he has work to do.
After walking for about twenty minutes across two streets, he came to a second-hand card recycling station.
He is also the owner of the shopping mall. Every Saturday and Sunday night, Chen Zhong comes here to work for three hours.
Chen Zhongxiang nodded slightly, but his face was still a little bit pale.
He had been used to Chen Zhong's face. When Chen Zhong came to work here, he had refused to take a short-term job. Since the beginning of his father's acquisition, he has always been the only one who has taken care of it, and he has also been the only one who has taken care of it.
However, when Chen Zhong said he didn't want the money, he finally agreed. Of course, Chen Zhong was paid, and generally Chen Zhong would take a few old cards with him as his salary.
Sometimes Chen Zhong would pick up a few unused energy cards from the waste pile, and Little Black would calculate a bill, and every month he would save a lot of money on this.
But since then, he has been smiling every time he sees Chen Zhong.
Chen Zhongming began to sort the discarded cards he had piled up. There were many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, virtual items, and even some rare plant and animal cards. However, all of the cards here were useless, and all Chen Zhong had to do was sort them out.
The work was done quickly, and it was obvious that he was very familiar with the work.
Chen Zhong folded his wrist and threw a card at the little black: "Oh, this card can still be used for a while. Oh, this second-star energy card contains at least half the energy, and Chen Zhong wondered why the original owner of this card would waste so much energy.
He looked at the two-star energy card in his hand and opened his eyes with a smile. He ran to the meter and inserted the card into it. When he saw the number of 523 bricks on it, he laughed and all five senses were almost squeezed into one.
Three years of work have given him his own understanding of this most ordinary card. There is not only one way to make a one-star energy card, but Chen Zhong has collected twelve different structures of one-star energy cards.
These unique cards have inspired Chen Zhong, who has successfully reduced the cost of making one-star cards to 95 ODIs by learning from the skills of the cards. However, such luck is not every day, and so far he has only collected twelve cards.
But today's luck seems to be good.
From the texture of the one-star energy card in his hand, it seems that he is a one-star energy card that Chen Zhen has never encountered before.
He put the card aside and continued to turn his head. There were too many of them, but Chen Chen was not tired of checking them. He was so fast that almost as soon as he touched the cards he could tell if it was what he wanted.
All this is due to his familiarity with the Star Energy Card. This familiarity is left over from three years of continuous work, and he does not have to look, just by feeling the hand to judge whether the card is a Star Energy Card or a structure he has seen. He is so familiar with them that every detail of them.
The fingers that had been drawn from the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
Lin Yi got up from the bed confused.
Her head was dull as if it were not her own, her hands were touching the luxurious sheets, not the old ones she had washed, the lights on her head, not the half-broken energy-saving style of lamps she was accustomed to seeing, her body aching as if it had just been torn, her wrists raised, the blue-green-purple mark on them, clearly visible.
She held her mouth shut, not wanting to let herself scream, and opened the blanket, and saw herself, not an inch inside, screaming almost out of the closet.
Lin Lin's eyes twitched, and he turned around, and he decided to take off his blankets, and he got out of bed and gathered his clothes, and he put them on, and he ran out of the house.
Oh...let me go, you let go...Jin Lin's hands and feet are struggling together.
The man's strong hand pulled her neck, without any effort, and immediately put her back on the bed.
His deep eyes, as if with a born pride, on a cold, icy veil, his nose-wings raised on a pale face, his skin as white as a ball, made her wonder whether the woman who had a good skin was jealous.
She had wondered about the many men she had seen, but the men she called men of God, when they came to her, suddenly turned pale.
Is this the man who spent half the night last night beating her half to death?
Who sent you, that you should give me medicine? Do you think you can leave here unharmed? He looked at the foolish woman, and in his deep eyes there was a flash of anger.
The strange woman, with a skin more than snow, a small face, a large pair of moving eyes, and a feather that flashed as if it were a frightened little deer, looked at him with a great look of fear.
When Gu Jingze's eyes fixed on her, she saw that Lin Yi's eyes were moving again with her brain.
But she was wrong.
The people in front of me, although their looks make one feel tearful, are clearly not the big superstar Guo Jingqiang.
This time she was again roughly taken by his arm, and when she fell to the ground, she even rolled around a little, and settled down again.
You're wrong, I'm the one who's hurt badly. Her butt hurts, her hands hurt, and the pain underneath is so bad that it's impossible to ignore it. She's burning up, she's just saying, "I'm in love with someone else, I'm not in love with you for half a penny, you think you deserve my medicine, and Ben's grandmother isn't just taking it, you're paying for my medicine!"
What is the meaning of the name "Lost"?
The face of Gu Jingze was tight, the eyebrows were like the Kawasaki, the dark neck was like a hunched beast, and the woman in the disorderly dress was staring at her, her clean white half-crossed shoulders were exposed, with the mark of purple-red hair, clear eyes, and on the pale skin as if a lotus flower was open.
The images of the night flashed back into his mind, and he felt a sudden burning in his lower abdomen, and again felt the obvious heat of fire, which was pouring through his body.
I looked away from her face.
The damned woman, who dared to give him a medicine, the medicine was so powerful.
He waited for a moment, and then Lin Yi finally got the chance, and despite everything, she jumped out of bed, and she pushed the man away with her strength.
She ran out of the house without looking back.
When she heard him, she looked around to see what he was doing, and she looked at herself.
You're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you're so...you know, you're so...you're so...you know, you're so...you know, you're so...you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you, you know, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you,
He shouted, and clenched his fist to restrain the damn ****.
The sound of a train of voices coming from outside.
The woman looked back, her surprised mouth was no longer appropriate.
What was that about? How did a woman run out of the room with her clothes on?
He raised his sharp eyes, the black eye shining with a radiance, and let the hen hurry to shove all the unnecessary doubts into her belly.
Gu Jingze was in the bathroom brushing her body until her skin was brushed pink, then she yelled at the mirror, "Mooooooo".
I was so worried that my mother would come to visit me, and I knew that it would not be good.
When the bathroom door opened, a beautiful lady stood outside, watching in amazement the bed full of filth.
Those who had not yet come to clean their beds were clearly telling everyone in sight what had happened last night.
I know what you want to ask, but, Mother, I'm busy today.
She looked at her husband and pointed to the bed and said, "My husband, I know you have been having an affair with a girl".
Gu Jingze pushed the door open, and said to Mu Mu, "You don't have to handle this, do you?"
How can I not care, Jingze, you have to marry her, you have to take responsibility for the children of the family.
Mother, I'm not going to marry her, I'm not crazy, she's just a strange woman, I don't even know her name.
Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! There stands the younger, for the thought of the woman makes him more troubled.
"You're not supposed to be with her, you've been with her all these years, you can't even touch her, you're not supposed to be together!"
Mother, enough! Mother, you are interrupting the evening.
But the excitement of the evening was great, and you know your illness, you can't touch a woman at all, your family has almost made artificial insemination ready for you to have a child, but you touched a woman today, which shows that she is the most suitable for you!
The city of Daoguang, which has been called the "Mountain of the Serpent", has been visited by countless strange people since ancient times.
The mythology and legends of the city are like a thick cloud that covers the city with a mysterious veil.
The morning light, on the mountain cobblestone path, the blue-clad men in groups with three branches of frankincense, the silent and fast march on the path, towards the back of the mountain, high into the clouds, smooth as a mirror stone wall run.
The mountains are wet and the dew is wet, but these people are running fast, carrying a rainbow. And some people jump from time to time, flying over the wind for hundreds of meters, the morning wind blows, the clothes dance, then the moment of the moment, as if the gods were coming.
From the hills, from the peaks, from the towers of the palaces, people are constantly coming and going, and they gather in front of this nameless stone wall.
The smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of the fire of the fire of the fire of the fire of the fire of the fire of the fire of the fire of the fire
In front of the crowd, just below the stone wall, a group of people dressed in gold and purple robes, with silver threads on their chests and behind their chests, with clouds and gray lines on the edges of their sleeves, and lilac flowers, and a group of people with a gorgeous body, with their hands full of dirt, standing there without expression.
The crowd waited a while in silence, when a red light suddenly rose from the east, and in a blinding red flash the sky was torn in four, and the multitude of the passers-by fell down together and bowed their knees to the stone wall, and offered a great sacrifice to the three pious rows.
Thousands of devotees chanted the mantra at the same time, and the sound of the chanting was interwoven into a tremendously small sound wave that spread far and wide. Gradually, a strange power rose from the chanting, and a bright seven-colored candle shone from the top of the heads of the many devotees, shining on the smooth and clean stone wall.
The apostles, dressed in gold and purple, fell down together and said a prayer with their lips as they prayed.
After half an hour of this, a white light finally appeared on the top of the stone wall, and soon the whole stone wall was emitting a clear white light.
The smoke of the chimney rose from the sky, and there were countless clouds of smoke in the stone wall, and the shadow of a man surrounding the golden light on several of the candles was hidden in the clouds of smoke. The shadow of a man became clearer and clearer, and finally three men and two women and five men in white robes, whose faces were covered by the golden light, appeared in front of the crowd.
The woman in the middle lowered her head and looked down at the crowd of people kneeling before the stone wall, suddenly holding a scroll in her hand, which she threw away with her hands.
The white light flashed on the stone wall, and the purple scroll woven of gold and silk was slowly released, and it fell on the old man in purple robes who led the worship of the many devotees in the front. The woman who threw the scroll said a few words in a low voice, turned around and left with a few companions around her.
Suddenly the elderly in purple robes shouted: "Oh, grandfather, mercy, mercy!
The bell rang, and all the people bowed their heads to the five men and women, and their heads were blown to the ground.
The woman who threw the scroll drank coldly, and all the passers-by fell on their knees, stiff as a board, and dared not make any more noise.
The other woman, however, laughed a few times, and then threw things back at her.
The stone walls were darkened by the light, and the five men disappeared without a trace.
How many strange shining objects slowly fell from the air, a sword, a bead, a small candle, five charms and nine bottles of medicine.
Swords, beads, and small shells are small as child's toys, but each one is glowing, dazzling, and obviously extraordinary.
The five-stringed instrument is more than a golden light, the violet air is forcing, if there is a wave of pressure after another wave that flows from the instrument, those who are slightly closer to the path are unstable, and are pushed back by this force.
The nine vials were covered with colored symbols and seals. When the old road that was just taken over by the scroll opened one of the vials in front of the many people, a clear medicine chest suddenly sprayed out, thousands of people in front of the stone walls took a deep breath at the same time, and felt that the seven candlelight, the blood vessels were washed as if they were cleaned, and all around were illuminated.
The smell of the perfume alone is worth more than the three months of hard work of the monks. The old man in purple robes is busy sealing the bottle tightly. The smell of the perfume alone has such a magical effect, and you can imagine what kind of treasure the perfume in this bottle is.
Several purple-robed elders whispered together for a while, collected swords, beads, axes, medals and medicine bottles, and then opened the scroll in front of the congregation.
The first half of the scroll is a text that is too vain to be read. The second half of the scroll is a text that makes the faces of the purple robes of the elders discolored, and they shout in panic. After about an hour, countless people flocked to the hill of Qinghai.
The potential of the Qinghai-Tibet mountain in the secular world is fully launched, raising an invisible giant wave.
Chapter 1
The hot July weather, the asphalt road under the scorching sun, emits a pungent smell of paint, a look that is about to fade.
The road is straight up and twisted by the steam.
In such a toxic day, there are hardly any pedestrians on the streets, even fewer cars, and everyone is looking for a place to spend the summer in the shade or in air-conditioned rooms.
A woman in a bright orange white shirt, dressed in a grey suit, walked hurriedly and ran straight to the Second People's Hospital.
The hair is sticking to the woman's face because of the sweat, and the woman's eyebrows are abnormally red, obviously from the sun.
The white shirt was wet with sweat and it was uncomfortable to be tied to, but Jo-Jo was busy with these things and grabbed the bag with the hundred thousand dollars.
This is the money she had to sell everything worthwhile around her to earn, her sister had to pay $200,000 for the surgery, and she had to figure out how to get another $100,000.
She walked straight to the room, and when Jojo's hand touched the door handle, she heard the conversation between the mother and daughter.
Oh, it's all because of Jo, otherwise the army wouldn't have divorced me. Oh, this is the voice of Jo's sister, Jo's sister.
Don't cry, I've taught you a lesson. Mother Jingyu touched her eldest daughter's head with pain.
Jo-young, who was outside, thought that her sister had not been caught cheating and that Chen-jun would have left with her sister, but what does this have to do with her?
When he thought of Chen Jun, Jo-young's eyes froze for a moment.
Chen Jun was originally Jo Jo's boyfriend, but Jo Jo's mother was pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child. Ding Jia-Yang scolded Jo Jo's mother, saying that Jo Jo was a guilty person, a small animal without conscience, and that she stole her boyfriend from her sister, and forced her sister to have an abortion.
In the end, Jo-young only had to withdraw, and Chen Chen-jun followed her.
Oh, my grandfather divorced me, my children are not with me, and I have this disease, what should I do? Oh, I don't want to die, I haven't been very good to you, I really don't want to die.
In the hospital room, Jozo's mother cried bitterly while holding Ding Jia's mother, who was so young and had so many good days ahead of her, and she really didn't want to die.
Ding Jian's mother was deeply moved to hear that her eldest daughter had been born with such a serious illness and to think that she would have to be a good mother to herself in the future.
Ding Jian patted Jo's back: You won't, you won't let you do anything. You've already raised money for you because Jo's dead head is dead.
Soon after the divorce, Jo-Jo suffered from kidney failure and had to change her diaper.
But in this marriage, Jozo's cheating is the wrong party, and Chen-jun is a government employee, Jozo's wife is clean and out of the house, and now she is sick and has no money to pay for her medicine.
Jojo, who had known for a long time that her mother was a bigot, was already numbed by the conversation and could not help but feel the pain.
She is forty years old, and since she broke up with Chen Jun that year, she has never talked about love, not because she didn't want to, but because her mother wouldn't let her.
Most of the money she earned over the years went to her mother, who used the money she earned to buy her sister a 150-square-foot suite, while she could only afford to live in a rented apartment for a few dozen pence.
She pays for everything her parents eat and even the water and electricity bills, and her sister pays for everything she does when she comes home, even though she comes with a little something in her hand, but she earns more when she leaves.
She is not married at her age, and people joke that no one wants her, but she doesn't know that her mother doesn't want her to get married, she just wants her salary.
But this is her mother, who, every time she falls in love, she dies trying to live, she can't help it.
After all these years of hard work, in the end, only three words were given to him, especially because Jozo was also responsible for his own cheating divorce, Jozo grabbed the 100,000 in his hand and suddenly didn't want to give Jozo a bribe.
It wasn't until after JoJo left that she heard a conversation that really made her feel desperate.
What if Jo-Jo had raised $200,000 and couldn't find a **? In fact, the doctor said that if someone in my family would donate a ** to me, the matching rate would be higher and there would be less rejection.
Leaning on Ding Jia's arm, Jozo said pitifully: "If you really have a family, maybe I can save some money on my medical bills".
** Some people are dying to get this opportunity!
Knowing this, Jozo realized that money was not enough to survive, she had to think of other ways to survive.
"Do you want to go for a blood test?" asked Yang Ting-Jia, hesitantly.
Jozo shook her head, her mother is the same age, she is not sure where better than her, since it will be, she will definitely want a good one: Mom, you are my mother who raised me, I can not do without you to move the knife, my father certainly can not do it.
"I'm going to ask her to take a blood test, she's your sister, it's a good match!"
I'm sure it's a good idea, but wouldn't Jojo say no? After all, it's a joke. Jojo's eyes are full of calculation.
In order to survive, just in case, she would never let JoJo have the possibility of rejection.
Miss Yang-cho, why don't you come and see your sister? Why don't you come in? Yang-cho, Yang-cho and Ding-jiao were talking to each other, and outside the door came the voice of the nurse.
Jojo's face changed: "Oh...you just overheard her conversation with her mother, didn't you?"
Ding Jianxiang said nothing, but got up and chased out, saw the back of Jo Zhou, and shouted Jo Zhou's name.
When Jo-Jo heard Ding Jia-Yang's cry, she didn't turn back or stop, her tears kept falling, but her heart was broken into pieces.
For her mother, her sister, she doesn't even have a house of her own, but her mother-in-law tells her sister, that her money isn't enough, and now she wants her mother-in-law.
The more she said, the more she hated it, even if she really owed it to Jo's family, it should be enough!
Jo's head ached, and she was trying to tell her mom that it was dangerous on the street when a car came rushing towards her.
A loud, loud, loud noise struck her ears, and Jo was speechless from pain, but she could hardly open her eyes to see how her mother was doing.
Ding Jiawei was really scared when he saw his little daughter lying in a pool of blood, so he ran over and said softly: "You, Yu Zhao, you're dead and good, at least you can help your sister when you're dead".
The girl was hit and killed, and the person who hit her must pay.
When she heard this, she stared at her deadly, dying, until the ambulance arrived and she was killed alive!
Chapter 1
The most painful thing in the world is that one minute you're dreaming of heaven and the next you're in hell.
Moussa is one of those people who two months ago sat in a classroom and dreamed of getting into a prestigious university, but now he is working a menial job in the sunny workplace.
Thinking of his misfortune, Mo Mo spat on the ground, rubbed his hands together and wiped the sweat from his face.
A young man of seventeen or eighteen, with a plain face, dark skin, slender body, and a pair of somewhat calm eyes. Perhaps the child of a poor family was born early, not old enough to make one look younger than the elderly.
The cement truck with the bricks in hand was dropped on the side of the road, and without asking for a shady place to sit down, this time the worker was not there, but it was a good time to sneak away. In the boring and busy workplace, it was very happy to sneak away for a while.
He sat on a concrete slab with a gold-plated sword, and kept looking at the road, and his eyes lit up; the road was facing a mysterious figure, which immediately attracted his attention.
Although the distance is so great that you can't see each other's faces, the figure is absolutely attractive, especially the graceful posture of walking, like a professionally trained model.
Don't just look at the women walking, there's a lot of learning in there. Instead, sit in the workplace all day, opposite the road and the pedestrian path.
He seemed to remember something, and pulled out of his breastplate a blue metal disk, the size of a coin, with a small blue chain tied to it, like a strange necklace.
This is the same thing that he discovered accidentally a few days ago when he was demolishing an old house, when he found an old frog in one of the walls, the frog pit pit, badly damaged, estimated to be a hundred years old.
If it's another hundred years old antique, it might be worth a little money, but a frog, even if it's an antique, might not be worth anything at all.
When Mo asked, he threw the frog on the ground, but did not want to break the frog, and a piece of metal fell out of it, which was the strange necklace in Mo's hand.
The blue metal disk is a bit strange, divided into eight areas from the top of the disk, with all kinds of strange symbols carved on it.
Mo asked, not familiar with the artifacts, but could also see that the object in his hand was a miniature version of a gossip board, which ordinary people would hang in their homes to ward off evil, as a ritual offering.
Although he is not superstitious and does not believe in the ability of gossip to be a good luck charm, he also knows that this ancient gossip should be worth a lot, it may be an antique, and if it is sold to an antique dealer, it is likely to get rich overnight.
Mo Qiu's eyes were filled with longing, and touching the gossipy necklace was like touching his lover. Once he became rich, the beautiful women who had previously only dared to peer away and secretly swallow water were not yet allowed to pick him up.
Something is wrong. Something is wrong!
I'm in trouble! Call the ambulance now!
A loud shout was heard from nearby, and immediately afterwards many people ran to the place, and the shout interrupted the beautiful dream of Mosh.
He looked at her in doubt, hesitated, but still got up and ran to the crowd.
He jumped at the sight of the situation. For almost fifty years, a middle-aged man in a suit was lying on the ground with a constant contraction, his face was pale, his breathing was open, his hands were tightly pressed to his chest, and it seemed painful.
From his eyes, filled with a deep fear, seemed to feel death.
Many of the workers came, but no one dared to step forward, and a group of workers who were not very cultured apparently did not know what was happening and did not dare to act.
I'm having a heart attack!
He recognized the old man's illness at once, because someone in the village had recently suffered a sudden acute myocardial infarction and died within minutes, and he witnessed the whole process.
He lives in a remote village where there are almost no doctors, and when a person is sick, he is treated with the simple herbs that his grandfather had passed down, and there is no targeted treatment at all.
His mother is sick and tired and there is no doctor in the village, and his biggest dream is to study at the most famous medical college in the country and become a doctor to treat her and the people in the village.
Unfortunately, he failed the exam, and could have been admitted to the Medical School of the University of Warsaw with his score, and could have qualified for free admission, but was replaced by a powerful brother in the family who had a relationship, and who had a lower score than him, but pushed him down.
Although he could have been admitted to other good schools based on his grades, the high tuition fees were beyond his means, and in order not to add to his mother's burden, he had to drop out of school and start working to earn money.
The site is in a suburban development area, far from the city, and the nearest hospital ambulance takes 25 minutes to get there.
He knew this man, and lived with him in the same tent, named Zhang Loy, who was known as Old Zhang, a very honest man, who could only do the lowest kind of work on the site, as he had no skills.
It is said that he has a son who is studying at university, and he has worked hard to earn money for his son's education.
Mo asked hesitantly looking at his colleague Zhang, who dreams of becoming a doctor, and had some knowledge of the pathology of some simple and common conditions, but for acute myocardial infarction, he knew that there were several first aid measures that could alleviate the condition.
But at the end of the year, who dares to save anyone? It is good to save nature, but if you save a bad person, the patient has a two or three-year-old, the responsibility may be put on his head.
The Navajo society is such a reality, perhaps a simple emergency measure to alleviate the illness and prolong the death time can save a life. But Mo Mo, like the others around him, did not dare to go ahead and help.
He took a deep breath, he was silent for a while, then he sighed, and walked towards the old man who was sick. He was not a bad man, but he was good with him, they were poor villagers who worked hard, they understood each other's difficulties, he was the pillar of the whole family, he looked at the old man dying with tears, his conscience could not do it.
Don't touch him, I'm a doctor.
A mysterious figure came from far away, running through the messy construction site to the scene of the crime.
The subconscious stopped its steps, and a breeze came, and a wonderful figure appeared before it.
It was a girl of great beauty, of a very tall stature, only half a head shorter than Mo Mo, with a flower of white rice, with a pair of thin white legs. She ran, moved her clothes, and moved people.
He was always looking at the young girls who passed by him on the job site, but it was the first time he had seen such a beautiful girl! A natural, carved, beautiful painting was constantly in his mind!
He found out that the white girl was the same girl who had been lying next to him on the road. He had been lying with her for a long time. Now he knew that she was not only beautiful, but also had a beautiful face.
The girl didn't bother to ask, but went straight down to check on the old man's condition, and soon the beautiful face changed, and it seemed that the situation was somewhat serious.
The patient was in shock, and the situation was not optimistic.
Can you help me?
The girl raised her head and looked anxiously at the man, who was the closest to her, and naturally she was the first to find him.
I can do that!
He didn't think the girl would ask him for help, but he quickly responded and hurried over to her.
Can you help me flatten his body and lift his legs slightly?
Mo asked if he knew of any ways to relieve a heart attack and quickly followed the girl's advice. He knew that the girl's advice was correct, lifting the legs of the patient to prevent the brain from being deprived of oxygen in the case of a patient with a shock, which is the best solution in the absence of oxygen pumps and other equipment.
He suddenly found his chest a little swollen, and he was getting hotter, and it seemed as if a piece of red-hot iron had been stuck to his chest. His face changed, and he subconsciously felt his chest, and found it was the gossiping tray that had been dug out of the blue box.
An Lin stood on top of the tower, facing the wind that was blowing loudly.
The wind was howling, the weightlessness of the sudden fall, even though he was already unloved, he was still shouting in fear.
The fear of the coming death overwhelms him, shaking every part of his body.
At that moment, An-lin's whole body was suddenly enveloped in a mysterious white light.
The terrible feeling of being overweight came at this moment, and he felt as if he had been in a mountain carriage, and had rushed to the bottom, and then rounded an arc, and flown up into the sky.
The screams of An-Ling continued, and after his body flew to the sky, it fell back on the roof.
The feeling of being overweight and losing weight, and the alternation of life and death, made An-Ling feel a twitch in her head, and then she threw up without any hesitation.
"Hey, little man, how are you?" "Oh, right now, a shrill voice came to Anlin's ears".
He looked up and saw an old man looking at him with a loving face.
The old man shall have white hair, and the bones of the calf shall be of the lily, and the whole body of the lily shall be of gold, and the lily shall be holy and without blemish.
The scene shook An-lin's whole body, and countless stories came to mind.
The story of the dream begins to appear in An-Ling's mind, and the beginning of the dream is this scene!
The phone is ringing!
An-lin shook his head and said: "Thank you, Xian, for saving me!"
The old man, who was called by An Lin as a fairy, gently stroked his white beard, and smiled slightly: "Hey, young man, you deserve a great year, why do you prefer to choose a light life?"
My mother died early, my father was greedy. After my father had sold the house, he owed millions of yuan in debt and was unable to pay it, and then he ran away alone!
What do I have to give back?
After my mother died, I was forced to drop out of school and work hard for the debtors.
An Lin nodded and spoke softly, feeling that life was a bit gray. All his life he was paying off debts, what difference is there between him and the shark, or rather, early abortion.
After hearing the story of An-lin, the Xian man, with a sympathetic look in his eyes, slowly opened his mouth: "Oh, boy, your life is really sad... so, you I met you, and I think you are very qualified, or let Ben Sen send you a set of system of yoga, let you change your life. "
An Lin heard that he was very lucky to have a relationship with a fairy, but he did not expect that the fairy would be so good, so he sent the system at once!
"Lord, you have been so kind to me, I don't know what to do in return.
The fairy smiled and held his hand to the sky, and then a pure white ball of light appeared in his hand.
"Come here, young man, and hold this ball of light in your hand".
The story goes that An-Ling is excited and can't wait to hold the ball.
The ball of light in his hand, emitting a warm stream, the light that flowed from the ball, was very soft.
The system is moving. The Sith slowly speak.
The fairy tale is just coming to life, and the white light globe is glowing!
At that moment, the Xian said to An-lin: "Young man, you will swear, swear to accept this system of war gods and never give it up!
The War God System?
What a name!
But how is this vow a marriage declaration?
When he had no time to think, An-Ling hurriedly said, "I swear to God, I will accept the War God system and never give it up!"
When An-Ling had finished his oath, the ball of light suddenly hit him, and he became one with it.
And then, a voice in his head: "The worm detects the host as a celestial body, qualifies, and the system begins to merge!"
An-lin was so excited, she wanted to cry.
I thought my life was gray, but I didn't think I would turn around, and now I'm living a life of a hanging system!
The fairies were so excited, and so excited that they cried!
"What's wrong with you, Mr. Yang Xian? Is everything okay?"
The fairies returned to God, wiped away their tears, and knew they were insane.
Hey, kid, you'll have to keep your fuel on after you get the system.
I'll do it!
"So, do you want to go to a nun school?" the nun asked.
I'm not going to go to a nun's school, but a nun will refuse.
I'm not a nun, but I'm a nun!
Anling almost didn't think about it and opened his mouth to answer. The Sanying smiled and handed Anling a gold paper and said: "This is my letter of recommendation, if you have it, you can go to the Monastic Union University to study, and officially start on the path of the monks".
The fairy-men have prepared for themselves the path of the proud dragon.
He received the letter of greetings from the Elves with great respect, and looked at the Elves with a grateful face.
An Lin was very curious about the newly born fairy who had given him life.
The name of the dragon is... don't say it. The dragon caresses the top of An-Ling's head, and his face is the color of compassion.
I have to go, bye, guys.
The elves bid farewell to An-Ling, and then flew away in the mist.
"You are a fairy, you are slowly walking!"
The heaven heard the fairies' laughter, which was as swift and as wild as the breath of a lifetime.
Why is this fairy so happy, how can she feel happier than me?
An Lin was confused.
At that moment, a female voice came into An-lin's consciousness: "Hello, hello".
The woman's voice was so beautiful and moving, like a swan, that she heard An-Ling's voice as if it were a ghost.
Is that the sound of the system?
An Lin was surprised.
At that moment, an interface appeared in An-Ling's mind.
The interface is gray, with only a few words: The WarGame system features will be activated when you enter the mainland.
What the hell is the continent of Taipei?
Thinking of the letter of greetings from the Sith, An-lin spread out the golden paper in his hand with great anticipation.
Then he found the golden paper with nothing inside, just a tiny, embedded handprint.
An Lin, for some unknown reason, put his hand on the paper and it matched the handprint.
Suddenly, the paper was glowing with gold, and An Ling only had time to make a surprised chuckle, and was completely engulfed by the golden light.
The sky turned for a moment, and the horizon was darkened, then brightened again.
Then he found himself again in the sky and began to free land.
An Lin once again experienced the feeling of jumping off the building, that sour refreshment no matter how many times he came, he wanted to cry.
An Lin looked up with some difficulty, and then saw a scene that he will never forget.
Two white-striped dragon-gates, a hundred feet high, stand between the heavens, and on the plaques are inscribed mysterious letters that he cannot understand.
After the gate, the palace is endless.
And the clouds were round about the house, and all the beasts of the earth were flying in the midst of the heavens, as it were a great and mighty host of the fairy.
An Lin stood there, his face a shade of shock.
It turns out that this world is a wonderland!
An Lin tried to calm down and let herself calm down.
A little later, he sees a woman in a long robe coming running up to greet him.
Hello, fairy sister. Yang Anling waved to the woman.
The beautiful woman saw An-Ling waving at her and walked over.
An Lin looked a little excited and asked: "Oh, beautiful fairy sister, please ask me what this place is, I didn't know much about this place when I first came here".
When she heard what An-Ling said, the woman looked a little strange, and then said: "What's in the rice? What's in the rice?"
I don't understand what you are saying.
The woman showed the same expression as An-lin and started: "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa".
An Lin was blinded at this moment, and a terrible conjecture appeared in his mind.
"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to speak Mandarin, but I'm going to be able to speak Mandarin".
The beautiful woman's hands are folded, some are angry.
I'm not sure what language I'm speaking.
What is she saying? I can't hear her at all!
I'm not sure I'm ready to be a mother.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hundreds of people gathered on a platform, shouting and cheering, and dozens of cars, most of them supercars, surrounded the crowd.
The most spectacular part of the event was the two cars that were about to start.
One is the most expensive orange Ferrari 488 in the whole lot, worth more than four million, and the one next to it is the cheapest Ford Mustang, worth half a million, and the two cars together form a clear contrast.
This is the match between the newly appointed Major General Zhao Feng and one of the top four generals, Zhang Han.
At the Ford Field, Zhang leaned silently against the car door, his clothes were torn, his hair was long, and when he lowered his head, he covered his eyes, and people could not see his closed eyes, and the cheeks were cut from the lower half of his face, and it was rare to see the unique temper of Zhang at that time, but now his temperament had become full of crap.
And the young man, in the crowd on the right, looks like the moon with the stars, his face as if to say that the world is under his feet.
Let's go see how much money was in the bank.
The first time I saw him, I was surprised to see him, but I didn't see him.
What is your name?
Did you sleep? The formerly immortal Major Zhang is now like this, Oh, the game is about to begin, what a coldness, oh my Major Zhang!
I'm not sure what he looks like now, but I think he's a poor man who needs food!
I don't think he's even eating, he's not supposed to be eating pork.
On the side of the Ford Mustang, a fat man with glasses stands with a three- or four-year-old kid's head at his feet.
The long powder-carved jade of the little girl, dressed in a white dress, and the delicate little faces resembling the lovely princess in a fairy tale, except for the hair that was a little messy, the rest was perfect, but at this time the tears of resentment were in the big eyes of the little girl, listening to the people counting Zhang Han, and she seemed to want to cry.
If it were put in the normal time, the cute look of the little duck would have attracted a lot of attention, but now, it's time for a one-man show at the top.
After a few years of mocking, Zhang Han finally had a reaction.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes for a moment, there was a trembling in his eyes, seeing the actions of the people in front of him, he stared at them, his eyes were filled with a contempt for the meaning of heaven.
How dare the likes of Yoon to bark at his own majesty?
Zhang Han suddenly uttered the following anonymous words:
The whole arena was silent, but the next moment, a laughing noise with a hint of irony was heard.
You're crazy, aren't you?
I'm afraid of becoming a monkey.
The crowd started laughing again, but Zhang Han was stunned when he saw the picture before his eyes.
Hey, isn't this when I was racing Wolf Mountain and the Peak Race in 2009?
How did I get here?
I'm not stealing from you?
I'm back, are you?
I was born with a thunderbolt from the Nine-Tails of Heaven.
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, Zhang's family was one of the eight big families in Beijing, and Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at the time, so Zhang Han was not afraid of the day, but once the family was on a plane trip, and halfway through the plane crash, his parents and sister were killed, and two uncles were the head of the family, but they could not stop the fall of Zhang Han.
Zhang Han was beaten up, and thought that his family was the victim, so he started to investigate Zhang Li, who had always hated his father, but was discovered by him, along with many other people who had been guilty of Zhang Han before, and was eventually expelled from Zhang's home.
It's been five years now, Zhang Han has been reluctant to leave, always wanted to find out, the days were hard but always persisted, until this time, the Wolf March Mountain incident.
Remembering that he had been seriously injured in an accident on the mountain race of the wolf, lost both arms, and was paralyzed for five years, he finally jumped off a cliff and lived, without thinking about the accidental entry into the world of monks.
With this knowledge, for five hundred years, Zhang Han will be able to accumulate all kinds of treasures,
Why not five years ago?
Zhang Han's face lifted a tear.
Not to do the duty of the father has always been the biggest regret in Zhang Han's heart, before the departure of his relatives, his youth and madness did not know what to do, caused a lot of trouble to his father, and even said a lot of words that made his mother sad, all this regret can not be saved.
The first is Baekhyun, who is a rebel, but his love for his parents is no less than anyone else's.
The trees want to be quiet and the winds not to be still, the children want to be nurtured and not to be loved.
I'm not going to die.
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's reflection, and he looked up, only to see Zhao Pei staring at himself coldly.
Five years ago you kicked me out of the city of Beijing!
Five years later today, my Los Angeles driver Zheng He returned strong, and you Zhang Han are not as good as a live pig! Remember, today my Zheng He summit made you Zhang Han lie down in Beijing!
I'm not as good as you are.
I'm not going to die.
He shook his Ferrari keys in his hand and said, "Hey, if you win me, this car is yours.
Zhang Han smiled and said:
I'm not sure.
Zheng He laughed and raised his hands and ordered everyone to lift the curtains.
After the race, the crowd behind them raised several television screens, and at the same time, remote control planes were raised all over the mountain, opening the screen, and a remote control plane transmitted the footage back, showing the entire circuit of the mountain.
Ready to go!
The fat man with the glasses on the back of the Ford Mustang nods his head in a dark way, and sits in his Ferrari.
The video was posted on the official Facebook page of the government of Pakistan, where the video was posted.
Why do you call people "silly" when you have cute little heads?
Zhang Han shook his head with a laugh.
You can win, Hank!
The fat man shook his fist at Zhang Han, making a gesture of encouragement.
I'll borrow your car and it will bring me good luck.
Zhang Han glanced at him, and sat on his side in the wild carriage.
Ready to go!
The two cars' engines are emitting a furious roar at the same time.
The Ferrari, with a smile on its face, is the pinnacle of the mountain.
The fat man in the back is smiling with a deep, meaningful smile.
At his feet, the lovely princess looked fearful and worried, her eyes filled with tears, and her eyes were pitiful.
The other driver, Zhang Han, was laughing coldly.
You're plotting to hurt me?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not the same person I was then. If you can't fix it now, what can you do to make it better?
Chapter One
The lake is called the Iron Lake.
The 23rd special waste disposal site of the Federation.
It is also known as the Tomb of the Unknowns.
As the monastic civilization developed, the ancient and powerful teachings that only monks could teach entered thousands of homes and became essential tools for ordinary people to travel, study and work.
The city is also a major producer of waste and metal scrap, while providing convenience to the people.
These trash treasures mostly retain a lot of energy, are prone to radiation pollution, and the construction of the treasure is very unstable, even with the risk of explosion, if left unchecked, can cause great damage to the environment.
So, in every big city in the Federation, there are a few special garbage disposal sites around the city, which are dedicated to the disposal of waste.
Special Waste Landfill 23 is located in the southern suburbs of the Federal Capital of Plovdiv.
Under the dusky sky, a swamp polluted with purple, emitting a rich stench, a mountain of metal fragments like hundreds of dinosaurs emerged from the swamp, the mountain was dotted with broken swords, beside the sword sat a crystal pile with spots, the tears of the cavity had already extinguished the fire of the spirit, only the small worms left to eat the spirit, the head out of the inside, carefully measured the four-volume tomb of the crisis.
The first is the "Humble!"
The countless metallic structures, like the goddess, flew and flew, and triggered the collapse of several garbage mountains around, raising smoke and dust, dancing like demons, and shadowing the entire sky.
Here, seemingly a no-life zone, only the insignificant ants and the worms make this place a paradise.
Lee Yao-hwan, hiding behind a pile of garbage, licked his dried lips, and his yellow windbreaker was covered with dust, blending him with the environment.
The young man's eyes were clear, but his emotions were not at all clear, and he was not happy.
Only when the dust and metal fragments were hurled at the pile of garbage he was hiding, did he retreat a little deeper into the pile, wearing a pair of windshields that were enough to cover half his face.
There he is!
At 3:52:38 pm, the usual time of day for dumping garbage, Li Yao, the garbage-eating worm, is having a blast!
The Jinkō watch he wears on his left wrist is a hunting-specific model introduced by Zen Master Zhong Zhongwei three years ago, which he found in a pile of garbage and repaired with his bare feet for two months.
In addition to timing, it has a very powerful function that can record vibrations of a particular frequency and inform the owner when a particular vibration is heard in the vicinity.
The feature was originally intended to alert hunters to the presence of powerful monsters nearby.
The first was a small, small, and small trash can that was built by Mr. Li Yao, who had it converted into a trash can to remind him that the trash can was coming.
A few moments later, accompanied by a small whistle, a dozen black dots appeared on the northern horizon.
The smoke from the explosion, which covered the sky for days, was still there, with dozens of small black dots mixed in, and it was not clear what was going on.
Li Yao nodded, his finger touched the side of the windshield, and a blood-red streak appeared on the windshield.
Under the red light scanning, the garbage ship hidden behind the smoke was outlined as a round figure, clearly visible.
The hunting function of the Jingo watch also locks in the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
Trash ship 1327 is you!
Li Yao lived in the tomb of Fapo from birth until he was ten years old, and he had a finger on every inch of land and every trash boat in the sky, and the trash boat number 1327 was specially designed to collect trash that was dumped on the eastern part of Fugo City.
The Upper East Side is the most luxurious and wealthy part of the city, with many monks living there, and their treasures are the most valuable.
Many of the fabrics are even intact, but are discarded by the monks and the rich, simply because they are a little outdated or a new generation of products.
For Li Yao, this is a garbage ship, a treasure ship full of gold mines!
Whoa!
Li Yao, with his feet firing like bullets, rushed through the garbage heaps, into the smoke and dust, and into the 1327th trash can!
Li Yao is like the most ingenious monkey in the mountain forest, sometimes he stands out somewhere on the garbage mountain, every time he steps, he can bounce a few dozen meters away, move the clouds, and enjoy the delight.
You bastard, you're eating with your father again!
At that moment, a dozen people emerged from behind a pile of garbage, dressed almost like Li Yao, but not wearing his advanced blood red windshields and a Yixing watch.
They were all with rods and sticks, and came out to attack him.
They are like Li Yao, a garbage worm that eats at the special waste disposal site 23rd street.
Where there is profit, there is struggle, the discarded treasure of a ship, for the high-level monks may be only garbage, but for these poor people, it is the hope of survival, Li Yao is the best garbage worm mixed in the tomb of the Fabo, and of course, most garbage worms are the nail in the eye and the thorn in the flesh.
Li Yao was indifferent, he smiled, his waist suddenly strengthened, his body was strange, but he turned ninety degrees without any sign, and a fat boy with a frown flashed in front of him, and he also stepped on his fat face with his foot, taking advantage of this foot, the whole person again flew thirty or forty meters.
Fat Dragon, come out and eat, whoever is faster, you should lose weight!
The fat teenager had a huge red mark on his face, his nose was almost in the fat, he was furious, he was screaming, the commander was running after him, and the group of pedestrians quickly entered the smoke zone.
The place has just been exploded, it is very unstable, dozens of garbage mountains can collapse at any time, even the most vicious gang of young soap dragons can't slow down and watch Li Yao wind and fire.
The soap dragon took a bite.
The explosion was followed by another one in a nearby garbage dump, where tens of thousands of tons of metal parts and debris were dumped, like a volcano!
What a spirit!
But a voice came from the midst of the smoke, saying, "Help, help, O Lord God of Israel!
A black-hot ray, darker than the night sky, came out, and slid around in a flood of metal, and then rushed up halfway, but it was a handful of spots, a gap in the blade, a blackened sword, a sword with a huge guard that opened like black wings, and Li Yao was like a drowning man who was dying to catch a straw, very clumsily hanging on the sword, black and swirling around, rushed to the sky!
In the sky, dozens of garbage ships have revealed huge figures, each of them hundreds of meters long, rolling around like the legendary crows that support the earth, covered in dense linen with thousands of symbols, flashing lights, colorful patches, helping these thousands of tons of people to resist the invasion of gravity.
I'm going to go!
The belly of a great crow opens, and metal structures and fragments of the treasure are thrown to the ground.
And the spirits of the heavens and the earth were stirred up with a great noise, and the whole assembly was astonished.
Even the garbage ships, weighing thousands of tons, were tossed and turned in the waves of spiritual power, and had to be separated to reduce the disturbance.
The people of Sablon are afraid to approach them, lest they be overtaken by the waves.
Li Yao still rides the black sword and swings left and right in the spiritual wave, and although he looks like a wolf to the extreme, he is as flexible as a muddy worm.
He was afraid to face the shock waves, but with more than a dozen years of experience, he managed to find a relatively calm safe zone between the tides of spiritual energy, only to get as close as possible to the landing point of the garbage treasure, and only to the water tower.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage ship, with a monstrous roar, changed direction, sailed back, and the dust gradually dissipated.
It was not easy for the soap dragon to crawl into the center of the dense dump, and he saw Li Yao sitting comfortably on a brand new pile of garbage, looking at him with a smile.
What a shame!
The face of the soap dragon is full of flesh, but the heart is full of entanglement.
The garbage pile that Lee Yao has chosen is clever, it is not the largest garbage pile, nor does it look like the most resourceful one.
The city is also surrounded by dozens of garbage heaps, which hold valuable trash treasures.
If you continue to mess with Li Yao here, you will probably be taken by other garbage-worm fishermen.
The other garbage-worms have been seen in the shadows, and the mountains of garbage have been cheered, that someone has found something of value.
Hearing that Li Yao, a smelly kid, was a student at the second high school of the famous Yang Chong Clan in Fugu City, he was shocked.
The Red Guards were a well-known and powerful sect in the southern part of the Confederacy.
Li Yao, although he did not learn anything about the true legend, but he was not a three-fisted two-legged man, otherwise he would not have been a single horse and a horse wandering in the tomb of Fa Fa for more than ten years, still alive and jumping, and also giving out a great nickname!
But he is gone, and where is his face?
His nose is still in the flesh! His heart is tangled, a storm passes, and the subconscious reaches out to catch a cold, but it is a fist-sized discarded crystal brain.
Li Yao smiled and said: "Shu Zhao Long, we all came out to fight for life, not only did we steal your crystal brain last time, but we didn't kill your father, so why do we have to die so much?"
You're so cute...Lon didn't expect Li Yao to come out like this, he was so excited, some couldn't believe that he had just kicked the fat off of his face.
Hey, look over there, the werewolf gang is coming, but they're not like me, a lone hiker, who will definitely eat dozens of garbage mountains and wipe them clean, and not even a screw will be left for you!
You've got a good set, let's go and clean up!
A group of garbage worms scattered and rushed to the garbage pile.
Li Yao-cheng took a breath, sat on his butt in the garbage, a big ball of sweat rolled down his forehead, and a smile burst into tears.
Fuck you, fat man, I'm not easy to find, the dragonfly-class crystal brain, it's cheap for you!
Wait, is my Li Yaoyuan stuff that good?
One day you'll eat my money and spit it out, and take it back to me, with interest, and you'll know why people call me a money-lender.
You can't, you have to speed up, the werewolf is helping the other guys, but it's more irrational than the fat dragon!
Hey, how many times have I told you, I'm going to save lives, not kill myself!
Don't lie to me, you can't even save a life, and besides, there's no one in the river!
Wang Yao was speechless, today he came down from the mountain, saw someone falling into the river near the village, hurriedly jumped down to save people, and after jumping down, he thought that he would not be able to water, and ironically, the water was not a person, it was a doll, very realistic.
I wonder if there are any people in the village who use this stuff for fun?!
It was his last thought before he lost consciousness, and when he woke up again, he was lying on his mattress, with his parents by his side, grimacing.
And less than a day later, the whole village knew that the stupid college student who had contracted the mountain, planted the herb, jumped into the river and killed himself.
80% of the children are in school, where are the famous college students now and where are the farms?
It's the chicken!
I'm not going to grow any more!
The father, who had been smoking a cigarette bag beside the village, shouted out the words, the people were nice, the old king heard the rumor, he panicked, and planted again, lost some money, did not lose, did not even lose his son.
So, this time, stop growing herbs, go to the city tomorrow and let your sister help you find a decent job, your Uncle Zhao's children just graduated from a not-so-famous school, found a job in the city, and now they've all bought a house there!
Wang Yao heard this and stopped raising his head at his parents.
He was a student who graduated from a prestigious university, and after graduating, he returned to the mountain village with a lot of enthusiasm, started his own business, and took over a deserted mountain in the village, wanting to grow herbs and make his family rich.
The first year, the herbs he planted were infected with insects, and the blood was not returned, the second year, the herbs bloomed, the long leaves did not grow roots, this was the third year, the eyes looked a little better, and this class was ruined again.
But after a little comfort, he went up to the South Mountain, a barren mountain, probably because of the soil, not much crop, but there are dozens of large chestnut trees, palm trees, a large slope on the mountain, where he has worked hard to open a few tons of medicinal fields, for this purpose he also spent money to hire people to build a hut on the mountain, electricity, and take care of these fields, wind and rain, spring, summer and autumn, he poured three years of heart, blood to give up, he really can not help it.
He looked at the herb and touched it with his hand.
Trying another year?
The test is performed on a test tube that detects the herb, and the trigger conditions are met.
A cold mechanical sound suddenly came.
What a noise, who?
The surrounding area is mountainous, with water and forests, meaning no one.
I'm not sure if this is a hallucination.
Did you activate the system?
The sound of the machine was heard again, as if it were on the scales.
What a ghost!
Wang Yao is a very active person.
The pharmacist system?
And it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking, that behold, a cloud appeared before him, and the likeness of a man in a deep sleep.
The illusion must be the illusion.
He made the head of the eagle to be seen, and the veil of the light which was in the air was not seen.
And behold, a wild dog came down from the mountain, and came to him, and spit forth his tongue, and wagged his tail, and was exceeding glad.
Where have you been?
This is the king's dog, who has been with him for three years. One by one, the dogs enter the mountain hut, and the king lies on the bed, feeling a little dizzy.
What was that?
He read the name of the group again, and the screen reappeared as if it were a projection.
You're here again!
After several experiments, Wang Yao determined that this thing was not an illusion, but something real that could not be explained by science. It had character attributes, skills, and packages, just like online games.
Professional: Rookie (you can't even count birds, count eggs at most!)
Physical fitness 1. Strength 0.9 Spirit 0.85 Agility 0.9 Willpower 1.1 (Average for a normal adult male)
Is it true? He's completely covered.
Well, he is now planting medicinal herbs, that's all that's left! The king of God who has returned is excited and suddenly jumps up, frightening the three little girls by his side.
There is a skill panel?
Why can't I open it? his subconscious asked.
You can't grow herbs, you can't do anything else, you can't grow them!
The words on the panel read: "The man who was in the car with the girl, who was in the car with the boy, was in the car with the girl".
I'm sure, what's going on? Who designed it, come out, I promise I won't kill you! What is this?
Wang Ming looked through the wrapped jar and saw a sign that looked like a water jug.
The ancient spring is filled with water, one barrel a day.
What's the use, reaching out?
The king thought about it, and in his hand was something else, a wooden water jug, an old perfume, held in his hand, and some weight, a light jug, with a water jug in it.
What a place of water, and what a spring of water!
He found a bucket in the room and poured out the water from the cistern, a small handful, but the water kept coming out until the whole bucket was filled and the water stopped coming out.
Is that weird?
The king stared at the water in the bucket, which was so clean and pure, and reached out to take a sip and put it in his mouth, which was so sweet.
Have a drink!
And he took the cup from the table, and rose up, and drank, and after drinking three great cups, he stopped, and drank, and felt that the whole body was much refreshed, and the weariness was removed.
The water tank is surrounded by three circles.
Come and have a drink too.
The king also put a bowl in the water-basin, and the dog soon drank, and then cried again, and wagged his tail, which was evidently not enough.
"I'm not going to drink it, I'm going to drink it!"
The man, a dog, drank half a bucket of water, and if he hadn't been so panicked, it is estimated that this bucket would have been drunk by them.
Wang Yao had never drunk such sweet water in his life.
Chapter One: I Want to Lose Weight!
On a hot summer day in the pond-cloud rainforest in the eastern part of the state, the clouds were thick, like a thin layer of moss surrounding a tree, a tree of the sky, in a vertical intersection, in a lush canopy, while several birds flew up in the air, fluttering in the sky.
The sun in the sky, which seems to have existed forever, is no longer what people remember it to be, but was pierced by an ancient sword of indescribably large bronze years ago, revealing the small half of the sword's edge!
This ancient sword, as if it had been for ages, came from the starry sky, pouring out endless springs, and a strong pressure, forming a glow, covering the sky, as if it could suppress the earth, so that all beings would bow down.
From a distance, the rainforest looked like a picture book, until the distant whistle broke it. A red hot air balloon was slowly flying over the rainforest.
The balloon is large enough to hold hundreds of people, and you can see a lot of young men and women, three or five in number, on the deck, laughing and cheering.
They are students from the city of Yangzhou, one of the four major monasteries in the country, who are travelling across the country to study in the monastery on board a flying boat belonging to the monastery.
Perhaps it is the expectation of studying, the journey is not boring for these young men and women, and there is some attraction between men and women, which makes the journey of 10,000 miles, something else fun.
The area is also equipped with a canteen, a prayer room, a medical room, etc. on the flying boat due to the distance.
At this moment, there are many students in the canteen of the airship, and one of them is sitting at the table with a fat little man with his belly on his back.
The little fat man, about seventeen or eighteen years old, dressed in a large blue robe, with a round face that barely even counts for a glance, was patting his stomach and making a shrieking sound, while looking with remorse at seven or eight empty plates in front of him.
I'm going to eat this and gain three kilos, I can't help it, I want to be the president of the federation, I can't die early in my senior year.
The little fat man was sad, and he was sorry for his past. This little fat man was Wang Bao, who was also a student at the Confucius Institute. His lifelong dream was to become a federal president, and to make it his lifelong pursuit.
In his memory, when he was a child, his father would often pat his head and feel a little bit of a "bush" in his voice.
You should remember that money solves everything, but it can also be abused, and you want to not be abused, only to be the ruler, to be the superior.
At first, King Bao did not understand, until he was in elementary school, because he did not deliver his homework on time, he was scolded by the class leader, after he sent two pieces of sugar, he was registered by the class leader, and reported to the teacher, all this left an indelible mark on his young heart.
From that time on he wanted to be a leader in the church - not that he could cheat anyone but that he himself might not be cheated.
But as he grew older, he found out that there were many others who could bully the headmaster, so he felt that no one dared to bully himself to become the largest official, that is, the president of the federation.
But his health was not good, and the family lineage was strange, and he still remembered that night a year ago, when his father, who was as thin as a log, showed him a genealogy in the family's kitchen.
It was the first time that Wang Bao saw the genealogy, he clearly saw that the ancestors of a generation, but those who weighed more than two hundred kilograms, died prematurely, and lived only thirty-five years.
That night, Wang Bo had a dream... he was reunited with the fat guys before he became the president of the federation.
The following year, for him, the weight loss thing had risen to a certain height, but even after the Federation entered the era of the spirit, with the spirit of the spirit, with the revival of the ancient martial arts, the weight loss method was also a lot of trouble, but Wang Baool tried almost all, the weight is still stable.
The memory of the incident made Wang Baool-Li decide to lose weight again tomorrow.
With this decision, King Bolton felt less stressed, gritted his teeth and played a little song, looked up at the distant blue sky outside the window, and his mind began to flourish.
I don't know what he gave Dr. Lu, he likes it or not, but it's an antique I left at home, and the old man should like it.
Wang Bao consoled himself, and thought that as soon as he went up to Dr. Liu, he would have a small hill in the courtyard.
I'm not a teacher, but I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher.
Thinking about this, Wang Bao felt that he was one step closer to the position of Federal President.
He is confident that he can become the Federal President, and this confidence is mainly derived from the fact that he has researched the biographies of all the high officials from the youngest to the oldest, and even summarized some of the tricks of the job.
Wang Bao-le looked out of the window at the blue sky and thought it was beautiful.
But soon he opened his eyes and noticed that in the distant sky there was a black cloud gathering, covering the sky, with lightning inside, and a flash of electric light slowly approaching, which also attracted the attention of many students, and caused alarm.
Wang Bao was also surprised that after the Federation entered the spirit age, the appearance of the spirit spirit caused a lot of amazing weather in the heavens and the earth, and it was difficult to fly safely, which led to the birth of the hot air balloon craft powered by the spirit stone.
With the continuous shouting, the thunder of thunder suddenly came, the thunder was astonishing, and the black cloud of thunder was seen growing rapidly in the distance, the lightning had spread out, like a black network, the sky was flashing, dazzling, and making one's heart beat faster, the original aircraft in motion, slowly slowing down at this moment.
And it came to pass, as the people were in a state of restlessness, that the door of the dining-room was pushed open, and there came in, as if by a breath of wind, an old man in a white robe, with a wrinkled face, but a fairy-like bone, and a straight face, and especially two eyes, and a brightness of vision, and a whole body, and a great voice, which was heard throughout the dining-room.
Everyone, report to the monastery immediately, put on your magnetic robes, and after half a dozen candles, we will enter the thunder magnet zone!
When he heard this, the disciples were amazed. They stood up quickly, because they were afraid.
Wang Bao's eyes lit up, and the old man in front of him, the doctor Liu who had given him a gift before, was looking at the other person's dragon-like stance, and Wang Bao realized that his previous investment was right, implying that this old guy must be very human, and he was a chess master.
While he was enjoying his medicine, the old doctor glanced at the king's mask, shouted, walked over, took half a black mask from his arm and threw it at the king's mask.
You are young, don't put your mind in some messy place, you haven't entered the court, you have learned to give gifts, your husband is also a man of great knowledge, you this mask, or keep it yourself. Oh, the old doctor is a shining, a clean and upright appearance, as if hating iron does not make steel is generally reprimanded.
Wang Baool took the mask, and he felt a little bit nervous, and saw that the old doctor was angry, and was in a hurry, just wanted to explain, but suddenly thought of the murder mystery that he had summarized in the autobiography of those high officials, one of which was to admit mistakes in front of his boss, and often make a big deal out of it.
So take a deep breath, hurry up and show a semblance of remorse, admit your mistake.
Teacher says yes, I was wrong!
Some of the elders were amazed at what he had to say, and some of them were afraid to say anything because of the suddenness of the grief they felt.
Wang Baool saw the look on the professor's face, was relieved, and had some good thoughts, implying that the high official's autobiography was indeed useful.
The old doctor shouted, looked up at all the students in the cafeteria, and pointed to the crowd with his right hand.
And you, all you future disciples of my path, see what your days are like, and remember always that I am the warrior, first stand, then speak, then act.
The old doctor was so disgusted that he went back to the dining room, and when everyone heard this, they all kept their heads down, a little ashamed, while Wang Bao's eyes lit up brightly, feeling that it was time to show themselves.
He quickly took out a booklet from his arm, wrote down his thoughts, looked up at the old doctor from time to time, showed a look of listening, and nodded seriously from time to time, as if he wanted to remember every word the other person said, which was also the trick of the killer he summed up in his autobiography.
The other students saw this scene as if the gods were looking at the king's treasure.
The old doctor stopped for a moment after seeing it, a feeling of strangeness that had never been before, did not come to mind, it was actually him who welcomed so many students, this was the first time he had met such a strange person, did not look at him for a few more eyes, but gradually laughed coldly.
Hey, little guy, your husband's horse is not so good, you should thank the thunderstorm, otherwise, your husband can breathe in one breath for three days and three nights, I see you can write it all in the booklet!
The old doctor's words came out, the mood changed at once, a strong breath came out of him, like a pressure, covered the entire dining hall, and the students were amazed, only thinking about the fighting method, or the old doctor was a foot high.
Wang Bao closed his eyes, touched the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording of the recording
Seeing the crowd, the doctor was pleased and spoke a few words of generosity and enthusiasm.
Oh, remember, to put your mind on the training, and in the future be a man, not greedy, not unjust, and never think of looking for any female companion, know the color of the letter on a knife, these days, my lord, my lord, I really do not like words.
And as we were talking, suddenly, a dripping sound came from the old doctor's voice box.
Doctor, where are you, people don't wear this magnetic suit, you're going to help me.
The sound was loud, and the doctor heard it, and his body trembled, and he coughed, and looked at the crowd with a serious look, and then he turned away with a burning heart, and rushed to the opening of the excitement of the spirit. Oh, come, come, baby, don't hurry, I have come to help you.
The scene was so rapidly reversed, so greatly altered, that all the people were moved to tears, and even the king's treasurer was moved to tears, and for half an hour he was breathless, while the people were in a state of impatient exasperation, and he gnashed his teeth and cursed a few words.
You old bastard, those things you said before are nonsense. We have so many female classmates, we can't all share, he is so old, and he comes with us to steal resources, isn't he an officer by virtue of his size?
The more Wang Bao-le wanted to be angry, the more he became determined to be a government official, as he discussed his dreams with his fellow students.
As the alarm sounded, the crowd was only finished talking, and one of them, angry, went to the monastery.
The Reiki Room, located in the central area of the craft, is, as the name suggests, the place where these students practice, and also the most secure place for the craft to pass through the special area.
At this moment, in the monastery, as the crowd gathered, all of them sat in rows, arranged by the monastery's ship's teacher, wearing the monastery's special magnetic spirit clothing.
Having just dressed in his magical costume, Wang Bao was immersed in his anger against Dr. Liu, looked around at will, Ben was depressed, because a glance in the distance, suddenly more nasty, his unconscious brow raised, showed a look of disgust.
He looked at a girl sitting on a two-legged nun, very moving, but now also frowned, showing a look of disgust, obviously in their eyes, they were both familiar and extremely disgusted with each other.
The courage!
They both were distraught, and hurried away from each other, as if they were even looking at each other, and felt as if they were closing their eyes.
You can meet this flat-top dummy everywhere, bored to death! What's so special about you, but a bad class leader, waiting for the court, with my official killing, my father can also mix half of the official's job!
Soon after everyone had dressed, the teachers of the temple boarding the ship checked one by one, and they took turns to be careful, even more severely warning the people that there was a danger after the aircraft entered the thunderstorm zone, and there was a certain risk of life and death.
And when they saw the people changed, the teachers who were with the ship departed in haste, and the doors of the sanctuary were shut, and the light was dimmed.
The monastery, which at this moment is still whispering, can, with the passage of time, become more and more tense, silent, and completely silent.
In the silence, as if he could hear his own heartbeat, even the king of the treasure, who was not angry, did not let himself get nervous, until after half a column, the whole ship shook violently and entered the thunder magnetic zone!
From the outside, the whole black cloud of thunder is like a big mouth, compared to the tiny hot air balloon that swallows the whole thing.
This weather, as if it contained the power of destruction, could sweep everything, perhaps only on the top, that round of the frightening sword Yang, could ignore all, as if looking down on people for thirty-seven years was not enough, or even longer.
And the year was thirty-seven in the year of Elul.
In 329 AD, the earth technology developed rapidly, there were no borders, the unification of the earth was achieved, and the era of federation was entered, and it was at this time that a great sword flew from the stars, penetrated the sun, and the world shook.
The great sword, perhaps broken by its hilt, broke into pieces in the tremendous shaking, scattering the stars across the sky, some of which fell to the earth.
With the arrival of the great bronze sword, with the fall of the debris, the earth suddenly became filled with a new energy that seemed to permeate the heavens and the earth, from which there was no end, and which was later named... spirit!
The spirit is like air, thick and thin, and because of the falling fragments obtained by the Federation and various forces, there are various methods of cultivation and cultivation of instruments, alchemy, and alchemical stones, and the text is full of antiquity, causing people to contact the ancient scriptures and become fashionable.
The emergence of the spirit, which quickly eliminated the original energy, changed people's lives, not only formed the spirit network, but also changed the course of the Earth's civilization, so that the whole Earth, opened the practice of civilization.
From this time the ancient martial arts arose, the world changed, and the era of the monks of all peoples began.
The period is called the Han Dynasty.
And at this moment, in the black cloud of thunder, the slow-moving red hot-air balloon, surrounded by countless lightning bolts, constantly bombarded, was protected by a soft light spread on the side, making the aircraft very stable.
As for the inner chamber of the central area of the cabin, at this moment all the disciples, including Wang Bao, are unconsciously asleep, as if a strange force guides them into a dream.
Only in the master bedroom of the ship's main deck, there were seven or eight teachers, some drinking tea, some laughing, and talking to each other, quite different from the way they had previously scared the students.
The leader was an old man, with a wrinkled face, a cigarette gun, and a cigarette in his mouth, and if King Baolu was here, he would have recognized him at once, the old man, the shameless Dr. Liu.
The old doctor, who was smoking a cigarette, smiled slightly as a middle-aged teacher began.
