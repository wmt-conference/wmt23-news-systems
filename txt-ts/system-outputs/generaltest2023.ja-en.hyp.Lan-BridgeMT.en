Park Chung Farm, located in the mountainous area of North Hamgyong Province, is mostly steep fields and the soil is not good.
This kind of farm got an unprecedentedly high yield last year.
The Qingzu Central Zoo Feed Guarantee Fisheries Office has made great achievements.
was established in 2011 with the mission of sending aquatic products for feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
While overfulfilling the catch plan, in recent years it has been supporting farms in Kiyotsu City, such as procuring agricultural supplies.
However, this time the business office supported not the city of Kiyotsu, but the farm in Kagamijo-gun, which is adjacent to the city.
What's more, I decided to help with the "subdivision" of Park Chung's farm, which is said to have the strictest conditions in the county.

To prevent accidents left behind by FUJI System development Experiment with own vehicle| Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic information on Aichi, Gifu, Mie, and Shizuoka
FUJI (Headquarters Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells electronic parts mounting robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent children from being left behind in the car.
A mechanism in which a motion sensor is installed in the car and when it detects the movement of a person, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
we are currently conducting a demonstration experiment with a pick-up vehicle at our own facility.
Protect the safety of children in the midst of painful accidents caused by abandonment.
we are currently conducting a demonstration experiment with two pick-up vehicles of the English conversation afterschool "teracoya THANK" for children, which we operate in Chiryu City.
Sensors that detect the movement of people from the temperature difference between people and their surroundings are installed in 3 places on the ceiling inside the car.
When the vehicle engine is turned off, the door is closed, and the movement of a person is detected after a certain period of time has elapsed, a warning notice is automatically sent.
By linking the information with the condition of the engine and door, false detection is prevented as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling the pre-registered number, it is displayed in the chat on a computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and care is taken not to make mistakes such as missing them.
The demonstration experiment will continue until around the end of February.
Kamiya Kazumitsu, Chief of Division 2 of the Innovation Promotion Department, pointed out that "during the experiment, peripheral issues other than the system were also visible."
For example, it was possible to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"If we want to expand the solution".
The trigger for the development of the abandonment prevention system was the successive abandonment accidents of shuttle buses across the country.
There were suggestions from employees with young children as to what could be done to protect the safety of their children.
We decided to develop it in order to make use of the know-how such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors that we have cultivated through FA (factory automation) related businesses.
FUJI's anti-dumping system sells ease of use.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to a shuttle vehicle, we aim to lower the hurdles for introduction and spread it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization while looking forward to cooperation from nursery schools and kindergartens.
] The start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shin-Osaka, originally scheduled for 2023, has been postponed, and the impact on town development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture is beginning to appear.
In Obama City, where the new station will be installed, the detailed location of the station is still not shown, and city planning including peripheral maintenance is still in full swing.
It is expected that the formulation of the plan will take a long time, and publication is required as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station planned for Obama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 19 years, the Railway Construction and Transportation Facility Development Support Organization indicated that the approximate location of the station was within a radius of about 2.5 km, centered on JR Higashi-Ohama Station.
n the winter of 22 for the finalization of the detailed station location and route.
In Obama City, the business related to the Shinkansen with an eye on the opening of Tsuruga and the opening of Obama in the future will be in full swing in FY21.
n the initial budget for FY22, we are trying to further increase the number of businesses and promote town development in anticipation of the announcement of the location of the new station.
However, the detailed location of the new station is still not shown.
The city is considering land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station, and as a project to formulate a basic plan, it has 3 million yen in the budget for this year, but it is expected that it will not be implemented.
City planning centered on the new station "takes time to form consensus among citizens" (city official).
There is a case of Echizen City in the new suburban stations in the prefecture that are not attached to the existing JR stations, but it can be seen that it takes a considerable amount of time to put together the overall concept.
There is concern that the later the announcement, the shorter the preparation period for opening, and the impact on the surrounding maintenance.
f the location of the new station, there is a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
n October last year, a citizen group in the city of Kyoto on the extension route submitted a signature to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism asking for the withdrawal of the blank sheet of the extension plan.
n Ishikawa prefectural political circles, the start of construction was postponed, and there were calls for a reconsideration of the Maibara route, and there were a series of movements to return the route settings that had been settled to the beginning, making it difficult to say that the neighboring prefecture is a monolith.
Obama citizens are relatively calm about postponing the start of construction, but there are concerns that the location of the new station is unknown and the opening time remains unclear, which will affect future momentum.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue the activities requested by the country for the early opening of the entire line, but the voices of the regions along the line calling for the earliest possible start of construction will be essential.
The indifference that "someday the Shinkansen will pass (west of Tsuruga)" cannot move the national and neighboring prefectural governments.
I want the enthusiasm to keep raising my voice.

Cat-shaped serving robot introduced at "Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store".
Lovely expressions are popular with family guests = Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, the movement to introduce a serving robot that carries food to the audience is spreading.
It is said that the lovely expression of the robot is well received by family customers, in addition to helping to save manpower in store operation and "non-contact" customer service to prevent infection with the new coronavirus.
Restaurant owners and related parties have said, "It is difficult for local restaurants to secure employees and part-time jobs, and serving robots will become more widespread."
"Gin, Gin, Genghis Khan♪".
While playing light music, a robot with a cat's face on the screen puts food on it and runs smoothly inside the store.
When you arrive at the table in the audience, you talk to the guests, saying, "I brought the food you ordered."
"Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store" in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City introduced a cat-shaped serving robot in August 2022.
When the robot waiting near the kitchen puts the food ordered by the customer and presses the table number on the screen, it autonomously runs to the table and delivers it.
AI (artificial intelligence) voice function is built-in, it reacts when the customer touches it, and the expression of the cat's face reflected on the screen is also rich.
The "Bonta Group", which runs the store, has introduced serving robots in 2 stores including the store.
President Toshiyuki Saito emphasizes that the reason for the introduction is "the biggest labor shortage" and that it is part of productivity improvement through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but it is said that the introduction has reduced it to 21-22%.
The robot also has the role of collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, which leads to efficiency in cleaning up afterwards, adding that "families and children are delighted, and it also has a promotional effect."
"Rokken Hoshiyama Fukui Store" of grilled meat and hormone hot pot in Arakishinbocho, Fukui City also introduced a serving robot in August 2010.
Hoshiyama Eifuku, president of Sonsan Shoten, which he runs, said, "Even if we are looking for employees or part-time jobs, it is difficult to come. I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage," he says.
At the Fukui store, the zone where employees serve food and the robot delivery range are divided and operated.
It is said that the rental fee for a robot is about the same as the wage for 1 part-time job.
n order to save labor, the store is considering introducing a robot as well as an ordering system using a tablet terminal, and self-service.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the ratio of active job openings to job openings by job type in December 2010 was 6.94 times for "customer service" such as restaurants, which is a job type with a high sense of labor shortage.
of the net system (Takagichuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which is responsible for the distribution agency of the serving robot, said, "The labor shortage of restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious due to the influence of the Korona-ka, and there are many inquiries about the introduction of robots."
President Hoshiyama analyzed, "It will be even more difficult for local suburban stores to secure employees in the future, and I think that serving robots will become more widespread."
Editorial] Echizen Town has made an ending note and distributed it to the townspeople who want it.
When I published the "Okuyami Handbook" two years ago, which covers the procedures necessary when a relative dies, a written heritage list, a family tree, etc., it is said that many people came to pick it up for themselves.
In various parts of the prefecture, lectures on how to write an ending note and how to organize your life are often held, and "End of Life" seems to have become firmly established among the citizens of the prefecture.
The ending note of Echizen Town is 35 pages.
5 Chapter begins with a review of one's own history, and describes the current state of health and asset status, future long-term care, hopes for end-of-life care, requests for funerals and graves, etc.
There is also a column where you can spell out what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message to your loved ones.
It seems like a pain to write that there are 35 pages, but you don't have to fill all the pages.
What do you most want to leave behind for the people around you, including your family?
The point is to make the purpose clear.
Bookstores and other bookstores sell a variety of notebooks according to the purpose, and you can feel free to start writing from where you can.
to job hunting, it is said that the word end of life was born in 2009.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
Many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly", and it is said that more and more people are preparing for their own end and the end.
more than 10 years since then.
The new Korona-ka that hit the world has not subsided even now.
Prices have risen due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, etc., and electricity prices have jumped to unexpected prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current high prices, and many are scratching their heads about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, funeral expenses, long-term care expenses, and grave management were shared by siblings and relatives, but now it is not uncommon to have an only child.
In addition, although life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a long time ago, the risk of dementia and long-term care increases with age.
I would like to keep in mind that there is also such a rise in social unrest in the background of the transient and unending end of life.
anyway, everyone would wish that they didn't want to put an undue burden on their partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword in the ending note, but don't be too selfish.
Instead of secretly writing down hopes and requests, I want to consult with my family once and calmly prepare for that time.

On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided at the graduation ceremony that it is "basic not to wear masks" for children and students.
of a large school "It is actually difficult to keep a wide distance between students, and I am worried about how to deal with it. Some students feel uneasy about taking off their masks."
n the news about wearing a mask at the graduation ceremony, it is said that this topic is being raised among the faculty.
n the other hand, one elementary school principal said, "If the country decides, it will be a form that will not be worn. If it excludes the chorus, isn't it possible to respond realistically?"
At this graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to ease measures, such as allowing the participation of current students who had refrained from participating or resuming the chorus of graduates.
n the prefecture, the prefectural high school is scheduled for early March, and the public elementary and junior high school is scheduled for the middle of the same month.
The prefectural board of education and the municipal board of education will wait for a formal notice from the Ministry of Education and Culture to decide on a response.
Also, cautious voices were heard about the Ministry of Education's decision not to require the wearing of masks in school education activities in general from the new semester this spring.
: The principal of the elementary school said, "One day, the response of suddenly not having a mask confuses the children. After deciding that "wearing is free", it is natural for more and more children to gradually remove it."

On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided not to require the wearing of masks in school education activities from April in line with the new government guidelines for wearing masks.
In principle, there is no mask in chorus, physical education classes, and club activities.

At the Hair Atelier Rim Rim, a beauty salon in Tsukamachi, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, the examinees are cut using scissors that have been prayed for passing the exam every year during the exam season.
from the examinees, "confidence came out", "I calmly faced the exam" and it is said that it was well received.
Nagata, CEO of the beauty salon, has seen and heard students opening textbooks while waiting for a cut or expressing anxiety about taking an exam during a cut.
So, in 2014, I started the qualified prayer cut, saying, "If it helps even a little."
Final date of national and public large-scale applications
In the beauty salon, every year, on the first day of work, at Kamisosha in Wakatake-cho, the same city, the scissors and comb are asked to pray for a pass.
round 80 people are cut every year.
In addition to taking high school and university exams, there are various types of exams such as employment exams and driver's license exams.
They are presented with pencils that they have prayed for.
Ogi Mama "To you who challenge to take the high school exam"

"Dear Prime Minister, 'The Breakwater of Life' from Tojinbo" is a book published at your own expense by the NPO "Heartwarming Literature and Editorial Bureau".
"Dear Prime Minister, 'The Breakwater of Life' from Tojinbo" We have published our 10th book at our own expense under this title.
Each newspaper across the country has covered it, and many readers have sent their impressions.
The purpose of this book is to share with you what we have heard directly from suicide attempters about the "social and structural" environmental problems that cause suicide in Japan, and to create a "comfortable society".
We have been patrolling the waterfront of Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, which is called a famous place for suicide, for 18 years and 10 months to prevent suicide, and continue to support activities until we find and protect suicide attempters and start again.
This book summarizes the problems heard from the 784 people (as of 2/6) who have been protected so far, and appeals to the Prime Minister for the following 7 items about the national measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) "Human rights violations" are piled up behind suicide.
The suicide victim is a victim of social and structural organized crime.
(4) The executive body treats citizens living outside its jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treats them coldly.
(5) Even if a person with mental disorders such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, it is treated as an "accident".
(6) The "duty of safety consideration" in high-risk areas of suicide has been forgotten and is moving towards commercialism.
(7) The part that cannot be scientifically proven in the doctrine of emerging religious organizations is deception, and the act of threatening the other party and making them offer money by telling future tatari is extortion.

The flow of attracting people to the island "Sakasama Real Estate" Okinoerabu Branch opened People who want to rent a house are recruiting | Society / Economy | Nankai Nihon Shimbun
Opening event that deepened the understanding of "Sakasama Real Estate" through talk sessions, etc. = 8th, well-known town
Okinoerabu Branch Office] On the 8th, the opening event of the Okinoerabu branch office of the real estate web service "Sakasama Real Estate", which is recruiting lenders by visualizing the thoughts of those who may want to take on a challenge by renting vacant houses or vacant stores, was held in a well-known community space in a well-known town. It was "entaku".
Through a talk session, the operating company outlines the service.
Masahiro Okubo, representative director of Tsuginova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), who is in charge of the management of the branch, said, "By carrying out this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, I hope to create a movement and flow that attracts people to the entire island."
In contrast to the usual real estate procedures, Sakasama Real Estate discloses the information of the person who wants to borrow and contacts the lender, and if an agreement is reached, they contract individually.
As a demonstration experiment responsible for discovering potential vacant houses and building relationships through vacant houses, On-Co Co., Ltd. (Headquarters Mie Prefecture) operated the service and started the service in June 2020.
This is the 7th case of opening a branch office, the first in Kyushu.
For the first time in the country on a remote island.
bout 20 people participated in the event, including staff of On-Co and Tsuginova, Wadomari, government officials of both well-known towns, and local residents.
Director Okubo explained the process of opening the branch office, saying, "While the movement to attract people from outside the island is becoming more active, if vacant houses and vacant stores can be utilized, I thought that the town would be more exciting on the island from there."
"I would like to connect with people who have properties on the island and people who want to do something, and we would like to help as many people as possible in one case to advance the initiative," he said.
shi Mizutani, representative of On-Co, said, "We need to take care of each vacant house and discuss what the locals want to do in this area, what kind of people they want to come to, and what criteria they choose." point out the points to note in the operation.
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information will come together," he said, calling on the islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

I have been to several different dentists, but when I sit on that treatment chair, there are teachers and dental hygienists talking from behind at a slight angle.
I'm wondering if it's better to turn around, but I also think that it's rude to keep facing the front because the posture is tough and difficult to look back all the time.。

Vegetable juice.
It depends on how you save it.

About Instagram.
I (ordinary person) currently have about 10,000 followers, but if someone who doesn't know this sees it, do you think it's amazing?
Or do you think nothing else?
What does it feel like?
I think it's amazing.
In general, it is a miracle.
I think something special was being done.
with problems and frustrations
I couldn't get enough time to exercise, so I bought it to try to rely on the popular pressurized inner.
body shape is H175m W80kg I bought L size.
I have a hard time wearing it at first, but I think it's okay once you get used to it.
I've been using it for a few days, but now I'm using other pressurized inners due to a problem.
The problem is 1. If the arm circumference is not quite slender, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve (just the upper arm) is too tight, and it becomes a situation before a little congestion, itching.
2. The lower abdomen is loose. I stopped using it due to the above 2 problems.
It's pretty tight when it comes to comfort, but it's okay to sleep with it on.
for those who fit
158cm, even 50kg S was okay.
But the big, muscular skeleton didn't suit me.
Since it is not a three-dimensional construction such as the buttocks, there are strange gaps and it is easy to fall down and does not fit well.
I always felt like I had to pull it up.
I think it's good if you have a body like a stick.
In terms of thickness, is it a safe thinness?
It was not a henna or a tearing feeling, but I was able to make a boot with a slim knee-high boot and make it refreshing.
lovely
I didn't want to show too much skin on my upper body, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit and came across it.
The top is fashionable with a knitted back and a one-point mark on the hem.
I'm glad you can choose a bikini underneath or shorts from above or 2 ways (^.
) It has just arrived, and I don't know the durability or what it will look like if it gets wet because it hasn't been in the water just by trying it on, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is solid, and the price here is a bargain. I thought it was.
There was no wire in the bust part, but when I touched it, it seems that there is a hard core at the bottom of the pad.
However, even if I wear it, it doesn't hurt, and it goes along the bust properly, so I think it looks good even when I move.
Did you change the model from no putt to being?
(^.
) From now on, I'm looking forward to going into the water ♪ Thank you ♪
45kg156cmM size and a little big.
The raincoat is a thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but I think it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is solid.
It came with 2 rain visors to prevent your face from getting wet.
The strength was no problem, and I could use it with confidence even on a bicycle in a storm.
There was no tearing after use.
I put it in a compression bag and carry it in a compact state.
Really, it was a product that exceeded expectations at this price.
I was able to put it on safely.
CLA 180 Shooting break was installed in the 2016 model year.
The method of installation is possible even for amateurs if you read the YOU tube and instructions.
Note that if you loosen the torque screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I dropped 1 and went missing.
After that, when clamping the gray connector by sandwiching it between the brown and red-green wiring, if you do it with a tapered type such as radio pliers, the force will not be applied evenly and the plastic will crack as shown in the picture and you will not be able to install it.
Call Support and they will mail you a new cable the next day and it's a very supportive company.
n the re-challenge, it worked well when I applied force at once with wide pliers as shown in the photo in the manual.
When putting the last main unit back into the car, it takes a little bit of effort to store the wiring, but I managed to install it.
After installation, there is no problem DVD, TV, navigation can be seen while driving.
If you order at a dealer, it costs over 80,000 yen, and even a specialty store costs over 40,000 yen, so I think it is a very cost-effective product.
below price
Honestly, I don't know why it's so highly rated. First of all, the cotton inside is poly, but it's cut in the cushion and there are fluffy and fluffy parts. It seems that it has already been used up, or rather, there are few cottons overall, and I thought about using it on a trial basis. I think that there are some products that do not fit or do not fit unless you try to use the product with the head and the dakimakura part integrated. I thought that there would be no failure if the pillow and the dakimakura were separate. This time I bought it for 3600 yen in the time sale, but I want to return it. In the first place, I reflected that the 5 star reviews should be more vigilant.
no, no, no
Arrival of goods.
let me use it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use and you can milk properly.
However, there are times when the sound feels a little annoying and the power button reacts badly.
I don't care because I can use it without problems, but those who care may be worried.
It's not super quiet 😅 If you use it in the middle of the night, you might be a little careful.
Also, I was worried that the part connecting the attached tube and the machine would fit into the tube, but it fits in a push-in shape 😂 I think it's easy to carry because it's lightweight!
Tips are needed to whip...
I'm not sure if it's the worst match for my hair quality or if it's just a matter of the performance of this shampoo, but it doesn't lather up at all in normal usage.
(The shampoo I've used so far was bubbling without any problems even if I used it normally), and here's the solution I found ↓ 1First, pick up the shampoo less than usual and let it blend into the whole hair.
(At this point, it does not foam at a level where not a single bubble appears) 2 Wash your hair once, then take an appropriate amount of shampoo and let it blend into your hair.
(Now it finally bubbles normally) Well, in short, it's a double wash lol The capacity of the shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo for the first time as much as possible... I'm satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
obviously I bought a shampoo that was so expensive, but obviously I had the feeling that my hair felt better.
However, it is an honest impression that I was not satisfied with the overall review.
botanico series is a pity because it was taken care of by facial cleansing goods....
The poor cost performance of being forced to wash 2 degrees even though the capacity is small.
In addition, considering the scent that seems to appeal to everyone, we will make it 2 stars here rather strictly.
is difficult to evaluate
There are negative positives and evaluation is difficult.
The cleaner of the blade cleans the front side of the blade.
I think the accuracy of the original blade is good and the matching with the razor is good.
: As intended, sebum, soap scum, etc., stains on the blade can be removed.
(only on the front side) If it is dirty and has poor sharpness, it will last longer.
: The life of the smoother is extremely reduced.
Titanium coating, ceramic coating, etc., which are coated on the cutting edge, the coating is easy to peel off.
(If you use 2~3 times of shaving, the coating will almost come off, so I think it is better to use this cleaner afterwards.
Be careful with the razor that says do not wipe the cutting edge.
) It can be replaced with fall-prevention rubber (vibration-proof rubber) that can be put under furniture used as earthquake preparedness, so I wonder if it is cost-effective.
The lifespan of the razor I use is up to 20-30%.
It is difficult to judge when the razor blade is thrown away, but I think it is when the cutting edge is rattled due to the damage to the blade due to shaving.
In that sense, I think it is a good product because it can prevent sharpness down by dirt.
(There is no sharpening effect with the cleaner only. There are times when it feels like it is being sharpened, but it seems that a small rust has been removed and it feels like that.)
n TV commercials...
I bought it when I saw that the face of a fairly old woman pulled up just by applying it once in a TV commercial.
I actually used it, the texture is a little harder than a normal gel, and I wipe it off with pre-lotion before using it.
It feels sticky and unpleasant at first, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will unexpectedly enter the skin.
t there was almost no stickiness after entering, it felt like the skin was sticking to the hands.
The lift-up didn't go like TV either.
I felt the tension all at once.
Since I have super dry skin, this alone is still not enough, and I have been using it since using a certain Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It feels just right.
I was expecting that the slack in the pores would also be covered, but it is not covered.
I think that one bottle will be effective, or if there is, there is also a lipi.
The work of putting it together must have been difficult, but ...
It is an effort to look back on the statements of politicians in the past few years.
While reading, I am somehow convinced that the remark at that time was ah after all.
However, when considering its value as a reading material, it is a delicate point to say that the "fact check" that the authors call it is necessary and sufficient.
honestly, it's not interesting to read.
I thought about various things, but I felt that the big drawback of this book lies in the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "facts" here will be true forever.
I felt that the fragility of "fact check" (also called the possibility of disproving) was quite suspicious from the way they wrote it, whether they were aware of it.
f the current Japanese reporters' perception of "facts" is at this level, it makes me feel a little gloomy.
It seems that there are many people who are recommended, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge about the content covered by this book.
If there are readers like the reviewer who are interested in the "fact check" carried out by the current Japanese media, I think this book is not suitable.
To those who do not improve their scores in the mock exam.
At my school, the political economy was printed, and it was really boring in a class format that felt like I was studying while doing it, and before I knew it, I hated the political economy.
honestly, this reference book saved me.
High 3 at the center this year.
I chose this as my study partner for my 1 hour round trip to school since I bought it in March.
First impression is just a simple word.
You have reached the realm of God.
When I finished 1 lap and asked about the past, the average at that time was 40 and I was 70.
I was surprised myself.
I stretch as much as I ate something strange.
I could feel from my skin that what I could get from this reference book was not only knowledge and information about political economy, but also synergized with my own strength and increased motivation for studying.
Thanks for letting me really tour.
crime prevention
8 years ago, I experienced two attempts to pick the front door and have been taking security measures.
This time it is a replacement from the camera I bought 8 years ago.
I used to use 30m infrared irradiation type (other companies).
This product was written by someone else, but the distance that can recognize the face at night is about 5m.
I agree.
I just arrived and haven't set it yet, but I've compared the camera's reflection and checked for bugs.
Image quality is much higher than the camera 8 years ago (of course).
It was displayed in 4 divisions on a 32-inch monitor, but if you maximize the shooting size, there is no problem.
For now, there are no problems with the product.
Those who are considering a level that can recognize faces other than crime prevention may be dissatisfied with night shooting in particular, but this price is the best!
I'm for crime prevention, but I don't require facial recognition.
Because I don't know if I'm wearing a mask or a mask (especially at night).
Professional burglars (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
It is said that it distinguishes between a small but high-performance camera and recording.
On the contrary, it would be a problem if you were not a professional.
However, recent burglaries are bold and clever, so we recommend using them in combination with various crime prevention goods, rather than relying solely on cameras.
For example, it is a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained at a home improvement store for about 1,500 yen (the latest is very bright, 6 units are available).
Since it is solar, there is no need for electricity, but in winter it does not light up until morning, so there are also 3 100V LED sensor lights.
With this combination, the distance that can recognize the figure was 30m.
Also, for daytime crime prevention, those who think that the intimidating effect will fade because the camera is small, I think it is necessary to cover it with ingenuity.
I have a sticker that says "24 hours security camera in operation".
It is an original product of the security camera manufacturer that I used before.
It is more effective for manufactured products than pasting those sold at home improvement stores.
The place to put it is the way of entry of thieves that cannot be covered by camera shooting.
n that sense, this time I wanted a sticker~.
At the same time, I made it negative because it is difficult to understand the instructions for setting the net.
If there are any deficiencies after setting up / setting, we will add them.
The more painful it is to read, the more sympathetic it is.
If she was born in Japan in 1982, her social situation may be a little better than hers, but the situation is still far from equal just because the Equal Employment Opportunity Law was enforced.
As I read on, the painful memories of living through discrimination as a member of society were revived and suffocated.
It depicts the suffering of all women who try to live as human beings, not as women, not only in Korea and Japan, but also in feudal societies.
t isn't it time for women alone to stop the emotional conflict and stand shoulder to shoulder to confront this society?
A drama that makes you think "a man is the worst"
The story of the protagonist who was sexually abused by his father as a child.
Of course, even as an adult, the wound continues to drag.
ll the guys that come out are the worst.
The hero's husband, who seems mild-mannered and family-minded, is also, in a sense, the lowest.
There are spoilers↓ Even if you know that the hero's sister is receiving domestic violence from her husband, ignore it, the sister-in-law finally has the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, but the hero's husband, who is a police officer, goes through, and the men are frustrated. development that can be done.
The old mother of the protagonist, who pretends to be out of focus, knows the fact that her husband (the protagonist's father-in-law) was killed by her daughter, but the daughter does not know it (publicly, the father's death is a drug overdose).
In short, after the death of the rape father, it seems that he never let his daughter receive counseling, and it is natural that the main character goes crazy.
Does the main character's daughter want to hear about her dead grandfather?
Do you care about Ojii who died so much at this young age?
In the drama? too many.
Several years ago, in the summer when a heat wave hit France, many elderly people died, and it was reported that many French people said that even if hospitals and facilities contacted their daughters and sons, "I can't pick them up because I'm on vacation", and the Paris morgue was full. .
These people are "dry".
n the end of the drama, I saw my husband and daughter, and I felt that they were "dry".
French ones are completely different from American ones, and many of them give a good afterglow to the vague parts, but I watched a relatively large number of scenes that I thought it would be better to cut this while fast-forwarding.
Professional boundaries
f a meticulous calculation and yet unreadable unexpected accident involved someone's life, he would have been prepared to bet on himself, even if he had calculated it from the beginning to some extent.
The script that embodies the drama that shakes such a minute heart, how far she deceives the surroundings to fight her own conflict that she cannot show in public and to pass on her beliefs, was wonderful.
Plus... Jessica's acting is really great.
No matter what you look at, there is no loss.
It's a professional job.
After that it broke down.
I have used 3 units so far, but this product broke in no time, good or bad.
The reason for choosing this product was to use the first built-in 2200 mAh vaporizer, but the battery ran out in 200 degrees 5 minutes 3 sessions.
2nd USB terminal is defective.
Charging is not possible.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problems so far, but when I put the battery back in about 15 times (I used the battery as a charger so that the USB terminal would not break), the contact became bad or it became difficult to turn on the power.
Press the lid to turn on the power.
If you are an Icos user, I think there are some who have experience.
It's that symptom.
Although it is mentioned in the note, the battery does not use batteries other than those attached.
The claws and catch parts are like scraping out, so there seems to be no bending.
So it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought it without the Staley logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe what I compared it to here.
The size is the same.
The chamber and the draw are the same.
LCD This one is cleaner.
It may be newer than no logo.
This is a low-key vibe.
Like a smartphone vibe.
logo, the vibration of the vibe or the sound is huge.
Cheesy Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese, but...
s are slightly different.
This comes with a liquid case.
without logo, solid like steel wool.
It's roughly like that.
I think Staley would have been better, but if it breaks quickly, you lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose to return it, so I proceeded with the procedure, although it was troublesome.
Ear rubber, but ear rubber
This flat rubber doesn't really hurt.
n good ear feel is the best with the same type of mask that I have used so far.
Even with flat rubber, it may be twisted, and the twisted heli part may rub against the base of the ear, making it more painful than round rubber, but I think that this product is not only soft to the touch, but also just hard to twist in length.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, not only does it fit, but it also makes it difficult to feel stuffy because there is a moderate space in front of the mouth between the nose wire and the underside of the chin = the mouth.
Because it fits the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it will fit everyone equally, but if you think that none of the other smaller sizes are not good enough, I think it's a good idea to try them once.
When I open the outer box, it is in the vinyl of the central slit like box tissue, but when I take out the first one, the ear rubbers on both sides get stuck and it is difficult to take it out, so I reduced it by one star.
's correspondence is 1 star
The price and taste are perfect, but despite specifying the date, I was distrustful of the response of the vendor who ignored it and sent it.
Besides this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
I always buy on amazon, so I also know the delivery person.
I tried to match the arrival date as much as possible because it will carry especially heavy objects up, but it's ruined.
It is said that the shipping company is having a hard time because of amazon, but I am thinking that there is one thing that the user can cooperate with.
I am disappointed with the response of the arrogant trader.
But the price is cheap.
If you are considering purchasing, the disposal cost is included.
There are many complaints and I don't think it can be used for a long time.
I think it is better to consider including the cost of disposal.
For reference, it seems that some municipalities have centers that accept bulky garbage for free or cheaply if you bring it in.
[Sitting comfort] The seat surface tilts slightly to the left and wobbles even more, so it is very tiring to sit.
If you move even a little, you will hear a loud noise.
It is noisy and cannot be used at night.
This point is the biggest problem, and I feel that I cannot continue to use it with this.
[assembly] The assembly manual is only a rough picture description.
The information required for assembly is insufficient, and there are many errors.
There is no explanation about the orientation when installing the seat surface and the pillar fixing base. Some people say that they lean forward in the review, but there is a possibility that the orientation when installing the seat surface and the pillar fixing base is the opposite.
correctly installed, the height adjustment lever faces backwards on the right hand side, and the dial that adjusts the spring orientation on the back faces forwards.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural in the forward direction, many people will accidentally install it.
There are no such basic precautions in the manual, and you will be assembling while trying & erroring while looking at the rough picture.
There is an error in the description of the contents. The list of contents at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who can't find the 12 included 8x20mm screws and are looking for them.
8x20mm screws are already inserted on the chair side, so be careful not to look for them in vain.
The working accuracy is low, and there seems to be a combination that can be inserted even with the same screw hole and screw and a combination that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, it is very difficult just to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that they are shipping with screws inserted in this way.
Also, I couldn't find the spare screw in the manual.
] The black part of the surface of vinyl leather has uneven coloring, and it is white in some places, so it is better not to expect beautiful things like product photos.
The explanation that the manual is incomplete and the supplementary explanation of the above installation method arrived at the e-mail address registered on amazon 2-3 days after the arrival of the product.
Originally, these items should have been issued immediately after the goods were shipped.
2-3 days after the arrival of the goods, many buyers have completed the assembly, so it is a completely meaningless act.
,,,
I am a big fan of Thermos and have been using Thermos straw type for more than 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use among the ones I have used so far.。
The mouthpiece parts of 1 straw have become a harder material than before, and the groove is clicked on the main body, and the mouthpiece parts of the straw can no longer be removed from the main body!
! I broke my claw trying desperately to take it.。
Only the tip of the mouthpiece of the 2 straws has become thinner than before, and the straw brush can no longer enter.
The mysterious part called the valve attached to the tip of the 3-straw is thicker than a straw brush and is dramatically harder to wash.
until now, I have never been dissatisfied with using the straw type, so I am a little shocked.
t's really stressful not being able to take a drink from the body.
The good thing is the outstanding cold insulation as usual.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and wash it the next day, there is still about 50% of the ice I put in the day before.
I don't drink hot, so I will continue to be a straw type.
Thank you for your improvement in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
I will review it for the first time.
(This is the impression of an amateur with little knowledge of buying a doll from scratch for the first time and wearing a doll eye for the first time) The product as shown in the photo has arrived.
What I put on the Obitzdor, it is very cute and the light also enters, I am very satisfied.
However, it cannot be installed unless it is a little hard when it is installed (the entrance) and you push it in with force.
I think the method is different, but I put tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About Shipping Since this is my first time shipping from abroad, I was looking at three weeks as a guide, but it arrived 8 days earlier than I expected (Narita Airport is nearby).
I was just worried because the shipping email was never sent.
Looking at the Amazon shipping description earlier, it is stated that it is still shipping.
There was no damage and no air in the eyes, and there were a lot of bubble wrap on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it's safe for the time being.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information okay even though it is a mail service from abroad?
I felt doubtful, so I will make it minus 1.
I think that the product is a great bargain at that price with this quantity without any problem.
Dolleye 8mm iPhonese model
a little small (working area is narrow), charging is terrible
I ordered the size notation after seeing it, but it felt about two times smaller than I had imagined.
Although it is larger than A4 size, the outer circumference is grooved for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I was thinking of using it when repairing electronic devices and making Gunpla, but as expected, it is difficult to use if there is no B4 size.
Use it only for soldering iron work, and use another tray or mat for other work such as assembly and disassembly.
t's impossible to put tools, put parts, and do more work ... in an area the size of a magazine.
I also thought about ordering another one of the same things and making it double the area, but the electrification is too severe during the work, and all the dust and cut parts stick together, so I think it's tough to keep using it for a while.
deadly defect
After struggling to open the lid of the battery box, I finally opened the lid using a rubber non-slip sheet, but no matter how hard I tried to load the battery and close it, it wouldn't close.
t is out at this point.
Highly rated!
Will the battery box lid close? ??
In addition, instead of the protective seal of the product, there was a small Saran wrap of Buyobuyo.
Is this a second-hand item? ??
Speaking of explanations, only English is written tightly on a small piece of paper.
There is no illustration and no explanation, and no one knows how to operate it.
It might be good for other fingers...
I found a good product!
I bought it right away.
Because I use it for pinky rings, it wouldn't be perfect if I didn't use it a lot, so it was a little clumsy...
But I think it's good for other fingers.
But I think it's a good idea businessman.
according to price
After all, you should not ask for quality for this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was crushed.
The size is just right.
People with thick ears may be harsh.
I might have bought it without a handle.

The design is good, but if you put it on your hand, will the effect not fade even if you put it on a big foot?
In Eastern Hokkaido in the harsh winter season...
As in other reviews, the heating wire has a net of only 110×80 and the arrangement is horizontal instead of vertical.
I wanted to warm the entire futon evenly, so I bought it because it was more expensive than the mat type, but it was bigger, but I couldn't help it because I couldn't check it at the store like a famous manufacturer.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and a bird's N-warm.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
Well done, but
It is small and has sufficient air volume.
Batteries can also be replaced with spares.
If you put it on the desk to adjust the angle, it looks good as shown in the picture.
If it is on a slippery desk, it will blow away with your own wind power, but if you lay a handkerchief, there is no problem.
If you use it outside/in a family restaurant, you won't notice the sound even if it's "medium", but if it's in an office, it's "small" and it's no longer noisy.
It is necessary to divide it into accompaniment when going out.
Also, even if it is "small" for office use, the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It is ideal for scenes where you sweat a lot on the go and run away to the family restaurant and cool down at once in a "big" scene.
The only thing is that when you throw it in the bag, the power button is rarely pressed and it keeps turning around without you knowing it.
It would be nice if there were some ideas such as slightly retracting the button (sinking it) or pushing the weak 1st push for a long time.
It is an essential item in times of extreme heat that is dangerous to life, so it would be helpful if you could make a better one.
Multifunctional light speaker
I use it as the weakest warm color and put it in the bedroom.
better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the luminosity and color by touch.
The white color suits any room, and the color light changes with gradation, so it's beautiful.
Also, if you touch one of your favorite colors, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it shine according to your mood!
Because it is LED type, long life can be expected.
n terms of sound quality, I think it's more than enough to satisfy my ears as an amateur.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it's multifunctional anyway.
The upper part is equipped with a large speaker.
You can enjoy music wirelessly because you can pair Bluetooth with mobile phones.
If you pair it with a mobile phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
In addition, since it also supports MicroSD, it can be linked with a personal computer and can play music as an mp3 player.
and piano practice
At the age of 66, he started to challenge DTM to prevent blurring.
Purchase the audio interface and the unit.
At first I was driving, but I fell in love with playing the piano and devoted myself to practicing every day.
I downloaded the attached sound source, but the protection didn't work, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but I use this for piano practice because the free piano sound source sounds good.
I'm glad I bought it.
There is a feeling of being deceived by appearance.
Is it a product with a hit or miss?
It will be a long text.
Since the synthetic leather of the Doshisha office chair (flip-up armrest) used for 4-5 years has deteriorated and become tattered, we are considering purchasing a non-synthetic leather flip-up armrest chair.
I searched for home improvement stores and furniture stores, but there was no suitable item.
I'm worried that I can't check the actual product, but I compromised on the look and price of the design and bought this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is 1 spare screw.
Caution] The attached hex wrenches and screws are sticky with oil.
Initially, I did not know the oil was attached to the hex wrench, and the body was white, so when the oil was attached, it burned.
Assembled in 40 minutes.
Complete product confirmation.
The flip-up armrest has different hardness in raising and lowering on the left and right, heavy on the left and light on the right in raising and lowering, and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest has a weak fixing force and immediately hangs down with a "click" sound.
The seat is made of non-renewable high-density urethane foam that feels hard and uncomfortable to sit on (weak elasticity?
) The competition mesh on the backrest is harder than other mesh chairs, and if you wear it lightly, your back hurts.
However, the height from the seat to the ground was 530 instead of 550 (the height of the seat is important for height) and the legs supporting the casters are not made of steel, so the durability remains in question.
I laid a cushion bought separately, and the mesh fabric part is used by laying a towelette because deterioration (wear) is likely to come quickly.
With 186cm80kg, I felt that only the fit of the back was good, but other than that, I think it is a product with low satisfaction, and I also feel that it is a product with a hit.
After all, it may be better to buy an office chair by looking at the actual product.
Since there was an Amazon email from the manufacturer saying hello to the purchase, should I inquire about the armrest and headrest?
under consideration.
Well, is it something like this?
My home environment, apparently right-handed BS4K is likely to be seen, so I bought a cheap 4K tuner from Pixela without much expectation.
As an experiment, free broadcasting of right-handed rotation such as NHK BS4K was seen again, and at the same time, it can be watched beautifully on the 4K TV of Panasonic purchased.
(Sometimes the image is jerky) The update came immediately after the purchase, and it is now compatible with recording, so I made some reservations and recorded it. Is it a situation where only the image stops or the frame skips occur.
The user interface has never been praised, and it is divided into "4K broadcasting can be seen".
By the way, during reservation recording, it feels like you can only chase and play the recorded program, and this area is also accepted as a positive function that you can record in 4K on the HDD.
You may be disappointed if you expect various things and buy, so don't expect too much.
expect to be improved with the update.
function is OK
I have only used the heat preservation function yet, but when I put in 2 500ml PET bottles, it became warm in about 2 hours and became hot in 2 and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but the fan sound is worrisome when idling stops, but I don't feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the smell of chemicals that were discharged from the fan because it was still new, so I needed to open the window regularly for ventilation.
As another wrote in the review, the burr of the part through which the shoulder strap passes is terrible, so you need to make sure to fold the burr with a flat-blade screwdriver or the like.
really fragile
Today, it broke suddenly 2 months after I started using it.
I liked the keystroke feeling and size, but it doesn't make sense if it breaks.
I use a PC all day to process images, but the volume becomes 100% without permission.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
The earphones hurt my ears and I can't use them, and using a PC at night is a distracting volume.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds, and the volume display appears and disappears repeatedly on the computer screen.
Furthermore, the keyboard interferes with the mouse instructions, so if you do not turn off the keyboard one by one, the mouse cannot be used freely.
and backspace keys also no longer respond.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's a thousand yen, you can buy it as a trial.
f you are lucky, you will be able to use about half a year.
This is a 6-month warranty compared to the 1-year to 3-year warranty for other companies even in the same price range.
The short warranty period shows the fragility.
The goods are the best, the packaging is the worst
The products are different colors and I love them.
If you are looking for a food stocker, I highly recommend it!
However, there was a gap in the large cardboard that was enough to roll around, and the packaging was the worst because there was no delivery note.
When I opened the box, the lid was also off.
The product is recommended, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but for the time being
When I bought a new lid, I bought it because I couldn't bear the support.
It plays a role in terms of the stability of the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make an unpleasant sound like 'Mekimeki, (likely to break)'.
You have to choose the one that fits the thickness of the lid, so be careful when buying.
cute back of the paws
When I had a dog and was looking for a bag to go out, I was attracted to the fashionable gray bag and bought this one.
It was a built-in style, and when I brought it, it was surprisingly light, so it didn't feel so heavy even if I carried it.
The zipper also moves smoothly and there is no such thing as getting caught.
It seems easy even if you travel for a long time.
It is very compact and easy to fold.
You can see the design of the paws even when folded, and it is cute even when placed.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, I fell in love with the look and the cheap price at first sight! Purchased.
TSA Lock is a favorite here for several years and I have a few others, but it's convenient, isn't it?
And number lock is recommended as a master of forgotten or lost keys.
However, to be honest, it's good because I put the most important point on lightness, but if you ask for durability and security, the fastener is tight for a week, because it's a cloth, use a knife! If it is cut, it will break in an instant.
Also, the place where the zipper is attached is sweet, so I want a device to overlap it.
If you are abroad, it is recommended to bring it on board.
For the time being, I used it on a Shinkansen trip, but it was comfortable.
Difficult to choose the size....
Because of its wide width, it is difficult to buy shoes.
Converse and Vans wear 24cm.
MRL996 is also 24cm.
Tough at first? I thought, but when I get used to it, I feel fine.
This time ML574 was certainly tough if my sister said that 24.5cm was tough and let me wear it.
It felt like my little finger was hitting.
So I bought 25cm.
When I reached it and opened it, it was big...
When I put it on, it loosens a little even if I wear socks.
I was worried about whether to return it, but it is troublesome if it becomes hard at 24.5, so I will put in an insole at 25 and wear it as it is.
I bought the team red, but it's bright red and very good!
There are many black and white monotone clothes, so wearing this will make it brighter!
165cm, male in his 40s
I ordered L size appropriately, but I recommend M size for those who are similar to the following specifications.
Height:165 cm Weight:60 kg Waist:81 cm Navel circumference:100 cm Typical metabolic syndrome belly.
In the water, the rashguard turns up, probably because the waist is loose.
I'm swimming while fixing the upturned part.
specially when you are off guard in the jacuzzi, the metabolic syndrome abdomen is in full view.
Also, if you walk while exercising vigorously up and down, you will still turn up from below.
<Product Making> The fabric is strong and not too thin, so there is no need to worry about the nipples being transparent.
At this price, I can be satisfied with this construction, but I think that the smaller one will fit better.
Gas leaked after all, but ...
Silver Colt 25 still had a gas leak, when I replaced the valve, there was a problem that part of the tank was chipped, but when I used [Bus Bond Q] to seal the tank and repair the grease, I was able to hit it smoothly. People who want to buy this colt 25 can disassemble and assemble it. Ask someone who can do it, or if you are not confident because there is no way to disassemble it while taking a digital camera photo, I can't recommend it very much, but it may be fun for those who think it can be broken. I also bought another black colt 25, the trick to disassemble is to remove the left side while holding the trigger with the thumb of the left hand, and I managed to disassemble it without flying parts. When assembling, I applied silicone grease to springs and small parts and fixed them with grease while assembling. When disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the safety screw, pull out the safety, remove the two screws on the left body so as not to damage the tip of the barrel, and do not pinch the front site and the inner barrel with pliers to get out, then you can disassemble the Monaca structure if you want to slowly remove the
I wondered what kind of quality 188 yen is.
You can use it properly when you need early turning and torque.
Light and small, and above all, simplicity without false decorations is good.
There is no rattle when attaching the bit, and I thought that 188 yen would be an amazing cost.
What about durability?
It may not be used very often, but I think it's a good idea to put it in a toolbox.
Purchased together with "1/4 inch hexagonal shank magnetic quick release driver roulette bit holder 60/100/150 mm" from the same distributor.
There is no problem here, or rather it was quite good for the price.
controller stops working
The machine itself moves and cannot be operated without permission.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the machine immediately moves in the wrong direction and becomes a symptom that it cannot be operated.
It is better not to buy this product.
I would like to warn everyone.
It's a cool product.
Although it is wired, we recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
Reliable and has not yet broken after long use.
It can also be used for PC games.
I think it was good because I was able to refund the Amazon gift certificate by returning it as a defective product within 1 month.
Does this increase the computational power?
I think it's a child who understands computation.
Wouldn't it be impossible if I wasn't a child who could understand calculations to some extent?
The problem is difficult to understand.
Also, where I give my master a tool, I slide the one on the screen up with my finger, but I tried it myself, but no matter how many times I do it, it doesn't go smoothly.
The point may be that it is easy for those who are used to DS to slip.
I don't really like the illustrations of cartoon characters, or rather, I think that DS etc. may come in from the fun of the screen, but ... for some reason I don't have familiarity.
The method of calculation is also a method of competing for time, for example, how many questions are correctly answered in how many minutes.
I understand how it feels to rush things like exams, but... shouldn't you be impatient and calculate?
For some reason, I don't like the fact that the gong sounds when it's over.
Isn't it okay to make it sound more pleasant even though you're doing it hard?
With this, I feel like I lost some money for 6,200 yen.
You can see if it's half the price.
sorry, this is why ☆2 pieces.
After all, I like the song of the persona!
Persona 3 reaches ED.
5 played halfway through.
Persona 4 has already been troconed in vita.
What you can do hasn't changed from the previous Persona 4.
Because there is no story, it feels shorter than the previous work.
The song is cool after all!
Just listening will make you feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
looked handsome somehow (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so it's not fresh...... Thinking so, 3 feels more profitable.
As a sound game, I found 5 easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see when the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even with a background.
Since the assist function is abundant, I think that even those who are not good at sound games can play.
If you turn on the challenge function, it may become a chewy game for audio game experts.
The triple pack has a soundtrack, but it's not a bonus, it's a solid 4-disc set, so if you like persona songs, I recommend this one.
unfortunate
I liked the color of the dial in the photo and bought it, but the actual product is bluish but close to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but for now I'm holding on. Is it possible to give up because the price is cheap?
After the review was posted, I received an apology from the seller and an email to exchange for a new product.
The subsequent processing was also quick.
I think the response was very good despite the cheap products.
Added 4 stars for correspondence. After that, I also bought gold.
I think the color is almost as shown in the photo and very beautiful.
But after all the buckle is not a double lock, the difference from the description photo is clear.
that's the only regret.
It gets very heavy in the evening.
I used it for SIM-free iPhone7s.
In the first setting, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (turn on data roaming from Settings > Mobile Communication > Communication options) and it worked fine.
The instructions attached to the product didn't seem to matter much...?
However, the area around Gimpo Airport was in bad condition with radio waves, so I was holding on to 3G all the time.
When I went out to the city, it became 4G.
n the evening and at night, the communication sometimes became very heavy, but now that I think about it, it may have reached the upper limit of hundreds of MB a day.
Better than I thought
I used Softbank Z4 for 2 years, made it sim-free and used it on Ymobile, and the Z4 got sick, so I was looking to buy a used Xperia, but I found and bought this new Saifu mobile phone.
Since I was using Mobile Suica, I was worried if I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so I can glance at the iPhone6? is the impression.
Since I don't play GAME, the processing speed is the same as the Z4, and I have the impression that it's a bit fast. In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition is slow, but it takes a while to recognize, so I use it here because face recognition is faster.
I thought it was amazing because it looked like an iPhone. I also made Android Ver9 and was able to shop satisfactorily.
What I'm interested in It's a little smaller and there is no strap hole * Compatible with a case with a strap hole Water resistance has not been tested A little heavy I have only used a little yet, but I am satisfied. Recommended
