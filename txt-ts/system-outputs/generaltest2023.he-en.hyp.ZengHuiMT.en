In the shadow of extinction: Three cheetah cubs were born in Iran.
The world's fastest animal falls victim to brutal hunting, droughts and fatal road accidents across the Islamic Republic.
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asian cheetah cubs recently emerged in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic situation of the endangered animal in the country due to droughts, poachers and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of a captive cheetah in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency” IRNA reported that the veterinary team in charge of the Turkish National Park in the northern Semnan province had decided on an imperial birth in captivity in the country.
It was also noted that fewer than 20 cheetahs have recently been documented in seven different districts of the country.
Following the danger of their extinction, the UN implemented a protection plan for them back in 2001, adding that the UN implemented a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now, Iran hopes that the new cubs can bring about an increase in cheetah populations in the future.
Last January, Iran's deputy environment minister, Hassan Akbari, said Iran's cheetah population had dramatically reduced from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to just 12 cheetahs in the country.
"Their situation is extremely serious, " Akbari said, noting that cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their living areas, hunting and even traffic accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world capable of reaching speeds of about 100 km/h ( 75 mph) .
Cheetahs can be found in various places around the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: We tested the Car Thing.
Quietly, Spotify began to try its luck in the world of hardware as well.
After years of development, Car Thing was revealed and launched as a small experiment in the USA•
We got our hands on the first device in Israel•
Vision: Make your old vehicles smart.
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, built specifically to provide a solution for people who own older cars.
A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to individual experimenters in the US, here in Israel, and now in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was outstanding, as our home car broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.
After two weeks of playing around, I realized how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's systems.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.
From idea to reality, it's from reality.
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email inbox  the possibility of purchasing a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which will make any old car system smart, making any old car system smart and smart.
The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors made headlines again after the music service updated with the vehicle mode - the same one we know today from the app - which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car in the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled Car Thing, its smart car system, in April.
Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to deliveries.
So of course, right after the press conference she held, I went to the website and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
Reconnecting to the site will give me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise - it won't cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing is the one.
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me greatly with its build quality.
And it's slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and has a big, bright and sharp touch screen on the front than I expected.
Also, you will find next to the screen a round button and a dial that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer the company to allow changing the activity of the dial so that I can control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate using the touch screen.
Perhaps this will be possible in a future version update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after leaving the car from the car.
The Car Thing undoubtedly brings that feeling back with its construction form.
All adapters were connected to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
On top of that, along the entire top you can find small buttons, which you can easily set up to play different playlists or podcasts.
By long pressing one of the buttons while listening, or by asking my voice assistant, I set up some playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio show that I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
An old automobile for a smart car.
After a fairly simple physical setup, I plugged the Car Thing in.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the application like a remote control, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.
That means you'll still have to connect your smartphone to your car, either via Bluetooth or AUX cable in order to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the application, since like the application on the smartphone, it emphasizes the photos of the albums and the playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations according to your taste, the search screen and your personal library.
As mentioned above, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or using the manual dial.
Moreover, at any given moment, you can call the device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify" by saying "Hey Spotify".
Using it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
In my experience, she recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.
This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of the article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
So, is it worth waiting for him?
My experience using the device has been great, which is a positive surprise to me given that it is still in the initial release phase.
Even in intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, occasionally a small stutter is recorded in the interface, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.
It is evident that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and among the different versions that leaked online during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered to whom exactly the company was trying to designate it for.
After all, his activity amounts to controlling the application on a smartphone, and not much beyond that.
What is different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and connecting it so that the smartphone will be closer to us when driving.
This question is reinforced when considering that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and in most cases will give the user much more functionality.
Despite all this, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
Being able to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I've come to appreciate over the past two weeks.
One question remains  will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company doesn't say much at the moment.
It hasn't even shared how many experimenters for the device it currently operates around the world, and how much it plans to add in its limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is the price that is expected to be 79 dollars ( about NIS 255) .
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse into a concept Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said there is currently no information about a plan to launch the device in Israel.

You recruited talent for the company.
That's how you'll keep your competitors from "hijacking" it from you guys.
The economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers  talent.
Here are some tips to help you maintain it in the workplace.

Despite the increase recorded in the past month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be among the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among the OECD countries, with a rate of 3, with a rate of 3, the first among the OECD countries. 5% ( 150) 6, 000 unemployed, according to the CBS) .
That is, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers  the Talents.
With regard to those professionals and managers who are proven centers of knowledge, experience and ability  the trends in the labor market teach that competition for them, the talents as they are called by employers, still exists in full force.
This means for employers that in the current state of the labor market, they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after recruiting a desirable talent, since once he enters the company gates  another company will already try to kidnap him at that point.
In other words, the competition for talent is so fierce that even after their recruitment they will continue to receive a variety of tempting job offers, with 30% of employees actually leaving only a month after receiving the job and starting work, only when the job begins.
This is why wise employers will immediately move from the phase of recruiting talent to its preservation phase, when the path begins, first and foremost, with preparation in advance and taking creativity already in its absorption process.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful onboarding process will make Talent enthusiastic about its new workplace from day one and even look forward to the next.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper absorption process that will help preserve the new talent:
It's no secret- the organization's willingness and willingness to share.
Share with the people who will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is vital and important to the company and the position, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and understands his value will feel desirable and will strive to prove the expectations placed by a son.
Knowledge is power  coordinating expectations |
Already on the first day, a conversation was held with the talent to coordinate expectations.
Get to know his professional background and see where he sees himself in the future, so you can show him the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him with to get there.
We are all people  personal acquaintance |
During the days of absorption try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and take an interest in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who shows interest in him and allows him to realize and express himself beyond the boundaries of his position will appreciate it and will want to maintain it.
Curiosity advances |
Already in the absorption phase, you can create an attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily by talking about bonuses and benefits, but by exposing it to an exciting field or interesting technology, as such stimuli for creativity lead to curiosity and growing interest in the workplace.
In addition, encourage the talent to voice his thoughts and opinions for the various projects in the company and make it clear to him that they are important to the organization.

Electrification in your pocket: The cost of not closing the coal-fired stations in June  NIS 1 billion.
Report of the Knesset Research and Information Center: The failure to close the coal-fired stations on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion.
• Israel Electric Corporation: "The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"

The economic cost of not closing the coal-fired stations on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center, the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is embodied in the consumer electricity tariff, which, as mentioned, is expected to increase in the coming months due to the increase in the price of coal.
In addition, in 2023, an additional excess of coal use of about 900, 000 tons is expected, so that this will be reflected in an additional cost to the electricity sector for not closing the coal-fired stations, assuming that the price of natural gas remains significantly lower than the price of coal-fired gas.
The report states that the NIS 1 billion reduction in the electricity tariff in 2022 meant a 4% reduction in the electricity consumption tariff for the home consumer.
That is, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about NIS 1 billion, and the total reduction that could have been for the home consumer is about 4%, that is.
It should be noted that as part of the reform in the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the IEC, which will build units powered by natural gas, intended to replace the coal-fired units 1-4 at the Orot Rabin site.
Further to this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, stating that the 4-1 coal-fired production units at the Orot Rabin power plant should be discontinued.
Schedules have been set in the decision, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly, the coal-fired production units 1-4 will also cease to operate at that time.
The IEC said in response: “ The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Department of Energy.
In accordance with the ministry's decisions, a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas.
Pay the price: Everything you need to know ahead of the interest rate hike.
Constant decrees: Next week, the interest rate on the shekel is expected to increase by half a percent.
How expensive the mortgage payment will be.
And what is recommended to do? •
All the answers.
The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts' estimates speak of an increase rate ranging from 0 to 0. 25% for 0. 5% is.
If the interest rate does indeed rise by half a percent, it will already stand at 1 at already time. 25%, the highest level is nine years.
This, after for years the interest rate in the economy was close to zero.
The sharp increase in the interest rate increases mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and drastically burdens households.
With the help of mortgage expert Shai Bundle, we checked how much more we would pay and what is recommended to do now.
If the interest rate rises by half a percent, how expensive will the monthly mortgage payment be?
On a 1 mortgage. NIS 2 million, consisting of 40% of the prime interest track, the monthly repayment will increase by NIS 125.
How much has the average mortgage become more expensive since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, this has been a significantly sharper increase.
This is because the interest rates on the other tracks that make up a mortgage ( and not just the prime track) also increased - in the index-linked track and in the fixed interest track.
If the interest rate does rise by half a percent, the increase will amount to about NIS 620 on a mortgage of about 1, according to Bundle's estimate. NIS 2 million.
The prime track ( 40% on this track) will complete an increase in the price of about NIS 280, assuming that there will be an increase of another 0, 000, assuming that there will be an increase in the price of another 0, . 5% next month.
The variable interest track is index-linked ( 26) . 7% in this track) will complete an increase of about NIS 120.
The fixed interest track - not index-linked ( 33) . 3% in this track) will be increased by NIS 220) .
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have an index-linked mortgage, Bundle recommends considering recycling for non-linked tracks.
For mortgage takers whose monthly repayments have increased significantly for them and who find it difficult to meet their repayments, he recommends examining refinancing a mortgage and redeploying it for a longer period of time.
This, to reduce payments despite the increase in interest rates, since it is always better to meet the repayments and not be insolvent.
Regarding new mortgage takers- he highly recommends getting acquainted with the different routes and adapting the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
So also in the future when interest rates fall they will be able to do mortgage refinancing with minimal early repayment fees.
Regarding buyers of apartments from a contractor, Bundle recommends making early payments to the contractor and taking out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "Construction Inputs Index" raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract is signed.
Residential construction input price index increased 6 over the past year. 6% is.
Against the background of the increase in the price of this index, the Banking Supervision Department announced yesterday that it is considering requiring the creation of a mechanism that will make it possible to include indexation within mortgages, but the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of fuel is getting expensive - and Israelis will have to pay more than NIS 8 per liter in July.
The Department of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8 at 8. 08 shekels•
At the same time, the reduction of half NIS per liter in the tax on diesel fuel will be extended until the end of 2022, when the tax on diesel fuel is reduced by half NIS per liter.
Record of a Decade: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 penny per liter- and will stand from July 1 at more than NIS 8 per liter.
The new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8/8. 08 Those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 cents per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022, the Tax Authority said.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continued rise in oil prices, against the background of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the increase in the dollar exchange rate.
Had it not been for the half-shares discount subsidized by the government since April, the price of gasoline would have passed the all-time high of 8. NIS 25 per liter.
The discount expires at the end of July and the Tax Authority and the Ministry of Finance are currently promoting publication for public comments of an order extending the reduction in the tax on gasoline, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9th.
In addition, as of August 10, 2022, an additional reduction of another half shekel will be established, so that only from this date will the price of a liter of gasoline be reduced by one shekel until November 15, 2022, which is until November 15, 2022.
This was reported by the Tax Authority.
“ We have reached a situation where I don't remember five months in a row of excess in state revenues.
We started a few months ago with the issue of reducing the tax on diesel fuel.
We've been working for a week on extending the excise tax, gasoline and diesel tax by four months - instead of half a shekel to the shekel, instead of half a shekel.
This is good for the industry and the citizen.
If we lower, it will affect inflation, lower production and ease the cost of living.
As finance minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus first and foremost on this, " Minister Lieberman said at the Israel Democracy Institute's Hurvitz Conference on Economics and Society.
As of today, more than half of the price of fuel is taxes collected by the government ( excise tax and VAT) - and this is a high rate of taxation compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic effect on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business expenses, the prices of public transportation and flights, transportation costs and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the friendliest city for business.
Petah Tikva came in second place in the Ministry of Economy's Doing Business Ranking•
After them: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon Lezion•
Minister Barbivai: "COVID-19 has emphasized the importance of local government in business development"

Ashdod is the friendliest city for small and medium businesses.
For the third year in a row, the Local Authorities Doing Business Index found by the Small and Medium Businesses Agency of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranked local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place Rehovot Rehovot Rehovot Rehovot.
After them are placed in order: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Be 'er Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Dana and Bnei Brak, respectively.
The agency compiles the Local Authorities Index.
This is the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a tool for the local authority, as it enables each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on several parameters examined in each authority, which examine the level of “ friendliness” of the authority to businesses located within its area.
The index divides the authorities into three size groups according to the number of inhabitants, since a local authority of up to 50, 000 inhabitants is not similar to a local authority of more than 150, 000 inhabitants.
Tel Aviv jumped this year.
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: Business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information and property taxes.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second place to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to 12th place and Netanya dropped from fifth place to 13th place.
A decline in the rating does not mean that the Authority's business service has deteriorated, and in many cases it is due to the fact that other business authorities' service has improved more and they have gone up in the ranking, while the authority that has dropped in the ranking has improved its business services less.
Among the immigrants in the ranking are Petah Tikva, which rose from sixth place to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th place to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
"Business  Growth Engine"
The ranking shows that Nof Galilee leads in local authorities, which include between 50, 000 and 150, 000 residents.
It is followed by Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modiin-Maccabi-Reut, Kfar Saba, Raanana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
In 28th and last place is Tiberias.
“ The index is intended to encourage local authorities to make it easier for small and medium businesses, starting from the date the business opens and throughout its activity with the authorities,” says Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Barbibai.
“ Businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of the business product and about 60% of the employees in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct influence on its businesses.
COVID-19 emphasized the importance of local government and we saw that authorities that acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, became the first governmental interface for them.
Ran Koiti, Director of the Agency for Small and Medium Businesses in the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: “ Local authorities play a key and essential role in the ability of businesses in their fields to thrive and flourish.
In the last two years, in which we are dealing with the coronavirus crisis, the authorities have a greater weight in helping businesses survive in their fields and survive in general.

46: 6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020•
The average weight per package stands at 435 grams - a jump of 36% compared to 2020•
Busiest month: December, when the average package weight was 524 grams.
In 2021, 46 people arrived in Israel. 6 million mail packages, almost 20 packages on average per household, according to Israel Post data obtained by Israel Hayom.
The amount of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46 arrived in Israel. 5 million packages, and lower than 2019, when 61 came in. 6 million packages.

The average weight per package jumped 60% in two years, from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021, from 435 grams in 2021.
The surge in package weight is mainly influenced by two main trends, both on the part of the seller and on the part of the buyer: The major overseas shopping sites consolidate items into one shipment and no longer ship each product from the “ shopping basket” in separate packaging.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the rapid delivery of deliveries, within a few days from the moment of the order, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which those buyers wish to receive close to making the purchase.
Also in 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month in which the highest weight and number of items arrived from abroad is December, with 4, with 4 arriving in December. 2 million packages weighing a total of 2, 200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
Black Friday effect.
More packages arrived in December than in any other month, probably following November's shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The large orders begin arriving in Israel between one and two weeks after the purchase.
Research: Most employees in the economy are not aware that tax refunds can be obtained.
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels.
You have changed jobs.
You went out to the LT.
You have moved from the city to the settlement.
You may be entitled to receive a considerable amount in a simple procedure.
All the details are inside.
Most employees are not aware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to high amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report from two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of 3%. NIS 6 billion, which means you should also check whether you are entitled to tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a high amount, as four out of five employees are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, on the other hand, they serve several tens of thousands of employees per year.
If you think these funds will go down the drain anyway, think again: Employees can apply to the IRS for refunds for back six years.
The Tax:On company conducted an in-depth study among 4, 000 of its customers regarding tax returns during 2020.
The company has more than 30, 000 customers, so the sample reflects their distribution in terms of population groups and in terms of gender, ages and geography, the sample reflects their distribution in terms of population groups and in terms of gender, ages and geography.
The data show that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis and the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of workers for unpaid leave, there were a number of significant changes, centered on a 15% increase in the average return to a household, which amounted to NIS 4, 300 per year. NIS 4, 300 per year.
The reason is that the unpaid leave fees are lower than the salaries, so there is a gap between what the worker paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received in 2020 by a customer of the company was NIS 121, 054 for repayments over the past 6 years.
What can you get tax refunds for?
One of the reasons to get tax refunds is a change in the workplace.
81% of people who changed jobs during the year received a tax refund of NIS 2, 943 on average.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of women who gave birth and were on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to a refund in the average amount of NIS 3, 538 for that year.
Another reason for reimbursement is donations.
100% of donors and taxpayers have received a refund.
Another factor in the refund is the failure to register credit points for alimony. 63% is.
The divorced did not update a credit point for alimony, so the tax refund for each year that has not been updated, such a credit point is NIS 2, 616.
Due to unemployment  unpaid leave expenditure: 93% of those who were sick or unemployed and who earned over NIS 12, 000 received a tax refund of NIS 4021 for that year.

100% of those who move to a qualifying locality received a tax refund for the transition year, since confirmation of residency in a qualifying locality is given only after 12 months from the date the resident becomes a qualifying resident, thus effectively the first year full tax is paid in full.
79% of the customers holding securities were entitled to a tax refund for the said years.
However, it is important for those who hold securities to check every year since losses are not rolled over from year to year but only through the submission of a report.
56% of men who have had a child do not register credit points in the year of birth on the pay slip.
The rate of repayment can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
CEO of tax:on, Tal Carmon: “ The coronavirus crisis has caused the salaried public in Israel to become much more active.
He is interested, checks and demands what he deserves in returns from the IRS.
It turns out that sitting at home, on unpaid leave or after layoffs, of hundreds of thousands of Israelis for many months, caused many employees to examine in depth what they deserve from the state.
It is important to know that today it is possible to carry out all the procedures for receiving tax returns digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past” .

Weekend and Independence Day of Kobi Shimoni, Subliminal.
What does your typical Friday look like?
"The weekends are the most important moments in life, as far as I'm concerned, " the weekends are the most important moments in life.
The sanctification and tradition are a very deep root in my soul.
My Fridays are dedicated to the children, Or ( 10) and Jonathan ( 8) .
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and kiddush supplies, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play cars on a sign, etc.
Sometimes you go to the beach, or even just wash the car, but you always stop on the way to buy a gift at the toy store in the neighborhood  and there's always another excuse.
When we return home with our gifts, the smells of cooking greet us."
What does your Friday dinner look like?
“ I was blessed with the cooking around me.”
On my side there is a Tunisian Persian cuisine, full of safes and an atmosphere of laughter, music, singing and joy.
From the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with a lot of meat, including a lot of meat.
When we get to my mother-in-law's, already from the lobby of the building, amazing smells come from her apartment.
I usually do the Kiddush, together with the children, who know it by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of inflatable."
You have a special childhood memory from the weekends.
“ As a child, I would wake up on Shabbat to the sounds of Israeli music on Network C and to the pale tracker systems, which we knew by heart that we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every remote corner of the country made him proud in his heart.
He died three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Kiddush and Shabbat were the holy of holies, mainly in the sense that the whole family should be together.
I recently released a song in his memory called 'Keeper of You', which I created with Osher Cohen,
I believe he was proud of this work, which sanctifies the bond between father and son.
We will soon mark our 74th Independence Day. As an enthusiastic Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a holy day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Paris and Tunisia, my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who gets to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I would climb trees and tie strings with Israeli flags to the house.
Today my independence days are full of performances, and I always meet an insanely happy audience, celebrating the fact that we can live the way we want us to live.
We need to ensure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren also have this option, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted.

"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": A Friday dinner that Esti Zakheim dreams of, and how she deals with the fact that her husband observes Shabbat.
Tell us about your preparations for Shabbat.

Preparations begin on Thursday night, when I return from a show or workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking such as goulash, roast and sauces.
On Friday, in the first part of the day, I dedicate the time to myself, meeting friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I attend rehearsalsals, or I attend rehearsalsals.
In the summer, Saturdays come in late, and I have a lot of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just watch a good series.
At Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Varda, who celebrated her 89th birthday, as well as friends.
You can share more about cooking.
“ I like shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry it.
On my Shabbat table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
Most of the cooking I do, and of course they warm up on the plate on Shabbat.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and in winter  the cholent” .
Your husband is a religious man and you are from a secular home.
How it work.
"Living with a Shabbat keeper is an endless compromise.
'Love your neighbor as yourself', in fact she went.
He can't go on family trips, so I often found myself packing up the kids and joining friends' family trips.
In addition, I am also the on-duty driver of the children, the one who brings them back on Friday night from parties and meetings and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Shabbat, because usually I don't show up on Shabbat and get a sort of 'forced vacation' - and that's a good thing."
The one you would like to host on Shabbat is the one you want to host.
“ I would open a big table and invite 'my dead'.
Sometimes I imagine what would have happened if my late brother Daniel had been alive, or if my father, the late Shneur, had seen my children: Uriel ( 23) and twins Tamara and Naama ( 16 and a half) .
We must have been fighting over football and politics and enjoying each other.
You have a special childhood memory from the weekends.
"We were a warm and united family.
On Friday afternoon, Mom would make a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and cookies from the market, and burn eggplants for a tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hannah at Yad Elio, or as she would say, Yad Elike, and she would make blintzes, and she would make blintzes.
Since only I didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the little one of the brothers, and worried about me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father at the port of Jaffe, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing."

The Kardashians speak: "It is impossible to invent what is happening to us"
"The chaos is never-ending, " mom Kris Jenner insists on the new series starring the reality show's first family, backed by her daughters and the new producer •
In an article that will be published in “ Shishat” magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR grinder, the brand factory and the change Kim wants to make in the world: “ I'm no longer the one who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie to post.”
It may surprise many, but the most in-demand brand in 2022 for the Disney content empire, which also includes Marvel and Star Wars movies, is the Kardashian family.
Details of the contract of the first family of reality TV and social media with Disney have not been revealed, but estimates suggest a minimum amount of $100 million was transferred to the family members, who now also function as producers, who also serve as producers.
In a press meeting with the stars, each accompanied by an entire beauty team that takes care of touch-ups of makeup, hair and wrinkles in clothes non-stop, the family members, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it is not a reality show, this time what is received on the screen is completely authentic, this time what is received on the screen is completely authentic.
“ You can’ t make up what’ s happening to us,” says Kris Jenner, the mother of the family, “ the chaos is never-ending.”
"We're showing how much we've grown since that series that came out in 2007, " says Khloe Kardashian, saying.
“ When we started we were terrified, a lot happens to us in life and it is impossible to simply delimit everything to a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
Many plots were catalyzed in editing, wrapped in a sweet colorful film and forgotten on the side.
This is not what life looks like in reality.
Now we're more exposed, naturally facing the camera, not just a reality show but an authentic documentary series."
When confronted with their new involvement in the production of the series, which effectively gives them total control over the content that is received on screen, Chloe claims: “ We're involved behind the scenes, seeing footage while editing and giving comments, but not from a defensive position but simply giving our opinion on what would make the series better, but rather what would make the series better.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel like I've grown emotionally from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they set more boundaries."
“ I've grown up” .
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all her might to change her image, from cheap reality TV trash to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I've grown up, " she claims, "I'm raising four black children, that is, from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country."
I want to change reality so that my children and the children of all my friends have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
That's my motivation."
"I'm no longer the same Kim who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie to post, " she insists, " but it hasn't completely disappeared from my life either."
A person has to be true to who he really is and take everything for fun"

Made in Blue and White: Yuval Shamla is the big winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world.
The phenomenon climbed Mount Madoriyama in 26 seconds and took the title of “ First Israeli Ninja” •
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of Ninja.
lolll - when I hear her say “ loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
There is a winner: Yuval Shamla conquered Midoriyama, and is the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel" and now holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and the 16th in the world.
Shamla has been a participant in the program since its first season when he finished in first place, and in the second season he lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be the last season.
Tonight he climbed Mount Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, beating the contestants Yogev Malka and Yishai Kalfon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season there can be crowned only one ninja who managed to climb the Midoriyama in time.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, as Yuval Shamla, the winner of the season, climbed the Midoriyama by 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the Ninja World title.
He will be able to compete for it again next season.
Well, we realized, full of superheroes, harnesses a perfect rock, and “ Ninja Israel” is the most important sporting event in the world.

Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat in the finals of a reality show and acted as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.

Rotem Sela represents for us such a perfect feminine ideal that it is distorted to present it this way on television.
She earns more on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when necessary, also advocate for her business partner.
She is a mother and also a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads series and reality shows, and serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Sela goes through a perfect screen too, because in the program she hosts you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the ninja world, everyone is larger than life, and the moderators first of all, the moderators.
Assi Ezer was involved in an affair that was supposed to erase him from the screen for a while, but since he is not an ordinary human being, he was rescued from it even before the first batch of advertisements.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who has broadcast European Cups and world records in his life, but is excited about a mega-wall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the final, two Olympic medalists ( Yarden Jerbi and Linoy Ashram) sat next to him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the conditions of entry into the superhuman world presented by this reality show for four seasons have been.
“ Ninja Israel” went out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Midoriyama and a full Yuval Shamla who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned a ninja.
There he led an almost insurmountable path, which took down all the superhuman characters that the show made sure to inflate their egos throughout the year.
Want to be Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Not with us.
We're looking for superheroes here.
The emphasis was on searching for a successor to Shamla, the so-called "King of Kings and one-of-a-kind", and other nicknames designed to clarify how perfect and unique he is.
As a result, the level of difficulty was raised, the girls who tried to compete on the tracks of the season crashed, and the boys competed among themselves to see who had more squares in their stomachs and the charisma of plywood to step into the shoes of the retiring Shamlalah.
They will say that this is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges, but as far as the vast majority of viewers are concerned, medium-sized couch potatoes like us - “ Ninja Israel” fosters for us an unattainable sports-achievement model.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
As Gil Sassover fluctuates between punches and conversations about holiness.
It's strange to see the comedian, Ex Comedy Store, host of a Saturday reception program on Channel 14, in which he tastes pots and gives a stage mainly to men.
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question, “ which reminds you of the concept of preparation for Shabbat” . “
Say: Sponge and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Abby Kakhon on TV, but the strangest thing would be if someone suddenly said “ Gil Sassover” .
Because Gil Sassover in the middle of the sponge and cooking is the most unrelated that television can offer.
And indeed, Kabbalat Shabbat, the new program he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, is disconnected in spirit from the time it airs.
Along half of it, Sassover stands.
He speaks quickly, holding a microphone in his hand even when tasting dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punches and conversations about holiness.
In his defense, it should be said that the sparseness of the budget is felt, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also felt in the premiere program, which was broadcast yesterday from Binyamin headquarters, is a clear gender division.
The men sing, play, dance, speak Torah, market restaurants and factories- while the women contented themselves with a small item, in which they excitedly told about running a sewing workshop, in which they talked about running a sewing workshop with excitement.
Happy Women's Day to be so.
Kabbalat Shabbat with Gil Sassover, now 14th.
Assisted Living Association v. Ruthie Russo: "To say, 'It tastes like assisted living' harms our activities"
Chairwoman Yuli Gat sent a letter expressing the union's complaint against an insulting statement, they claimed, by the judge of the “ next restaurant” in one of the trailers for the program.
Ruthie Russo in response: "I'm glad there are places that invest more in the cuisine of this population."
The Association of Nursing Homes and Protected Housing in Israel against “ The Next Restaurant” : The letter sent by Chairman Yuli Gat and reached “ Israel Hayom” reads as follows: “ In the pre-broadcast broadcast broadcast broadcast broadcast on all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said, 'Food tastes like sheltered housing, ' i.e., the food of a closed institution with low-level food.”
“ The tone chosen by the judge of the program, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food the contestant served instantly cancels our years-long activity to fight against the ignorance that exists in the field, because the sheltered housing houses operate restaurants in the various houses for the benefit of the residents with the highest level of chef dishes.”
It was also written: “ Service teams and home managers are fighting for the image of sheltered housing that offers solutions for quality housing for the elderly, including alleviating loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living and more”, and more.
In Israel in recent years, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most difficult disease in old age and see community places as a proven solution to the disease.
“ Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, so we dedicate resources and efforts to serving residents the finest food.
Most shelters use professional chefs to build a menu.
We will be happy at any time to invite the judges team to be impressed by the winning dishes served every day to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, as well as on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff in the sheltered housing, we will ask for your apology and clarification.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly."
Ruthie Russo said in response: “ I'm glad there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population, which definitely deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, chefs everywhere, even in sheltered housing.
" Double standard: In Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't cancel it. “
Nick Cave responds to criticism.
The singer addressed criticism leveled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards•
The singer responded: “ The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“
Earlier this week, Nick Cave canceled a show in Russia due to the war, declaring that he “ stands by Ukraine and prays for the madness to end soon” .
In doing so, the acclaimed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled performances in the invading country.
But in the case of Kyiv, his cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet told the singer that he was a hypocrite, since in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two performances held in Israel, despite the much criticism he received on behalf of pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to Israel, Kiev told local media at the time: “ In the end, I am here for two reasons: The first is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second is because I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians.”
The same Ahmet remembered well Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even posted a scathing post on the singer's personal and uncensored website, The Red Hand Files, in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying country, and therefore the situation of Palestine is the same as that of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your message about Ukraine, " Ahmet wrote. “ The fact that you did not support the Palestinians in this way, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost the factor responsible for Palestinian suffering.
It makes me very sad, since you represent a double standard here, " the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story does not end here, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he emphasized that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians."
The first situation is a previous unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, hoping to change the security order of Europe as a whole, hoping to change the security order of Europe as a whole.
The second situation is complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters in shelters.
I have great sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are and who it is."
Kyiv added that while he is not interested in detailing his views regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supports the Palestinians as well, noting that in the last 20 years he has often participated in fundraising events for them.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Ahmet, " the singer clarified, "this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently experiencing a catastrophe on their land."
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them, I would “ do it” .

Latent morbidity
In the report of the National Corona Campaign Knowledge and Information Center, published this morning, noted that "there is a decrease in the average of new confirmed cases to below two thousand per day, on the weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients and those hospitalized in serious condition."
However, they emphasized that "there is a hidden morbidity on a significant scale and in practice the number of infected is much higher."
The number of institutional tests carried out in the community ( without weighing the tests of the returnees from abroad, Y) - low, and stands at less than 20, 000 tests on average weekly alone.
The low scope of tests makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends.
State Comptroller's Report: The actual budget in most years of activity of the Medicines Basket Committee is smaller than the recommended budget.
According to Matanyahu Engelman's report, during more than 20 years of the basket's activity, the Ministry of Health did not supervise the committee's activities.
The report also states that the minutes of the meetings are published significantly late, if at all.
In addition, the auditor recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activity  and updating the basket's work procedures •
Another flaw found relates to the fact that since the committee began its activities, the Ministry of Health has not asked the HMOs for reports on the scope of uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket  which would have made it possible to analyze and control the budget given to them.
The Medicines Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the HMOs  but a new report by the State Comptroller published Tuesday warns that the company has been operating for more than 20 years without control reports on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervising and examining its activities and examining it.
Israel Hayom correspondent Ran Reznik adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing revelations in Israel Hayom about the failures of the basket of drugs.
According to Matanyahu Engelman's report, he recommends "in the process of expanding the basket, make corrections and improvements, which will lead to a better utilization of the health services basket budget that the public is entitled to".
Throughout the years of the existence of the mechanism for adding drugs to the basket, in 2021-1998, eight billion shekels were added to the state budget  with the addition fluctuating annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels  with the addition fluctuating annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels  between 0 and 500 million shekels  with the addition fluctuating annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels  each year.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the healthcare basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated to expand the basket was smaller than the volume of requests.
In most of the Committee's years of operation ( 90% of the time), the amount of budgetary increment was less than 1 per cent. 5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.
The auditor notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the height of the annual supplement in order to enable certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that "the transparency model in the basket work is flawed"
Thus, for example, the procedure for the work of the Basket Committee states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 160- 109 days, when sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in publishing the protocols undermines the transparency of the decisions; due to this, the ability of the bidders  patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies  to submit repeated requests as soon as possible and relevant may be impaired, after they have learned lessons from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and amended their proposals, and reassessed the feasibility of receiving them in the next round, " the auditor noted in the report, "The comptroller noted in the report, "The comptroller noted.
“ The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules set out in the procedure.”
Out of thousands of submissions, only one economic comment was submitted.
Another criticism of Engelman concerns a preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The auditor found that about half ( 46%) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.
Another flaw concerns the activities of the subcommittee of the basket of drugs, which is closed to the media and the public, and in which patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The auditor recommends adding a public representative or examining the possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without confidential commercial details.
The procedure according to which the Health Services Basket Committee operates states that "an economic assessment must be submitted" to a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions  and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, requests were submitted to the Basket Committee for 2019-2021 to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report found that the requests were not accompanied by economic assessments, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing the damage caused by obesity-related diseases or due to the ability to avoid stomach shortening surgery.
It also emerges that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparations for treating the growth of chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The auditor also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the HMOs have also been included, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health ( the “ Third Addendum”) .
This, when the legal framework for this step is regulated only retrospectively.
In the past six years, NIS 74 million of the addition to the basket of medicines has been used for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the procedures for the work of the basket and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as “ drugs at no added cost,” the use of which does not cost the health funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The auditor suggests examining the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and shortened track, so that the basket of drugs can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no supervision of the use of particularly expensive drugs.
The audit also shows that since the basket committee's work began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds to report and has not supervised the scope of uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the Ministry to analyze and control the budget given to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports relating to the years 2009-2006 have been published, and these have also been published considerably late ( the last one was published this year and dealt with the utilization of the budget in 2007-2009) .
“ The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, irrelevance of the conclusions arising from the test after such a long period of time, subcommittee suboptimal pricing, and decision-making based on non-final findings,” the report said.
In addition, the Ministry also does not audit and supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not conducted lessons learned from them.
These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket( 1) . NIS 7 billion in 2016-2021)) .
For this, the critic wrote: “ It is recommended that the Ministry of Health carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use compared to the estimates.
Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the Basket Committee and the Subcommittee, and about how the estimates are prepared when pricing drugs and technologies and improve them.
" Shocking and unimaginable": A stormy discussion in the Health Committee about the poisoning in Beit Dafna.
The indicators of the first deceased Jose were normal ten minutes before her death.
Committee Chairman, MK Silman: “ If people there cared about the kitchen being like home, it wouldn't look like this.”
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old woman from the Beit Dafna residence in Holon died of food poisoning, medical indicators were taken that were normal, the director of the daycare center claimed Tuesday at a hearing of the health committee.
“ We have night caregivers checking in during the night and there is a nurse who does rounds and turns.
There were several reports of cases of diarrhea and the same resident actually the last time her measurements were taken was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal and they were normal.
She was monitored like the other Dickers with diarrhea.
She is a nursing patient, we went to get a baby to assist in her transfer and then that resident did not respond.
We started CPR and called the nurse, ” the director described what had happened last Sunday morning at the residence.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized, and a total of about a quarter of the residents of the residence ( 33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea to host contaminated goulash meat.
The director of the daycare center said the remarks against the backdrop of claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of caregivers.
Dr. Naama Noss, head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, said: “ We cannot determine unequivocally what caused the three deaths.
Only blood tests were taken from them."
It was also brought up at the hearing that even from the residents admitted to the hospital, it was no longer possible to obtain a stool sample because they were not diarrhea and therefore it was not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
An engineer on behalf of the Ministry of Health also noted that “ the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary condition in kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs or at the request of renewal of a license” .
The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that a committee of inquiry has not yet been appointed for this case and for a previous case of allegations against Hosim that took place three months ago at the “ Bnei Zion” institution in the Sharon region.
Health Committee Chairwoman Idit Silman said during the discussion: “ If people there cared about the kitchen being like home, it wouldn't look like this.
The welfare dormitories rooms need more.
They are health sensitive and need extra supervision and care.
It is shocking and incomprehensible what happened there.
The terrible findings were discovered even after they knew that the Ministry of Health had come to check them.
Where the supervision and responsibility of the ministries are.
How in such a discussion the ministers and the CEOs of the ministries are not present to give an explanation of what is happening here. “
Yigal Nachtomi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who runs the daycare center and even ran the daycare center himself, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire system are established with only one goal: Do good to people: Do good to people."
The people who died are people I personally cared for.
I anesthetized one of the tenants on my hands.
This is a shocking event for us."
Samdar Una, a former resident of a residence the same age as her, snapped at him, saying, "Enough with the lies and nice words."
I was there” .
Gali Barmi, Parent Representative at Akim Israel: “ We have complained before about the food and have not accepted the criticism.”
Oren Hellman founder of Equal Chance for Integration of Persons with Disabilities protested that the names of the deceased Hosts had not been published: “ Their names don't even know their names at all.
They are worth less than that.
We underestimate the lives of our children."
Suspected Wolfson failure: The surgeon caused a rupture in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Feras Abu 'Aker as director of the hospital's breast surgery unit.
The chairman of the doctors' committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, had been warned before his appointment.
The hospital: “ He is appreciated and experienced” .
First publication: A terrible mistake occurred at the Wolfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during surgery the doctor performed a rupture in the patient's heart, leading to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was conducted on April 19th.
This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Feras Abu Akhar at the hospital, after he was appointed director of Wolfson's Thoracic Surgery Unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, which was designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large rupture of the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.
But the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised difficult questions regarding the management of the hospital.
The director of the oncology institute and chairman of the doctors' committee, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation into the affair in a letter he sent to the hospital director, Dr. Anat Engel.
The letter raised very serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu 'Aker, after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
A huge hole in the heart.
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient was lucid, functioning and had been treated by him for the past four years.
Recently, he had a spread of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid was discovered inside the myocardium, in which the heart muscle is located.
Also, surgeon Dr. Abu 'Aker was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred during the operation, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of Wolfson's cardiothoracic surgery department, who was operating on a child in the next room at the time, "was hurriedly called to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart, " and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of Wolfson's cardiothoracic surgery department, who was operating on a child in the next room, " was rushed to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."
He said the heart was drained of blood, blood pressures were zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu 'Aker was not professionally and personally suited to run a thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and even though he was supposed to be the direct manager of the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without involving him and accepted Dr. Abu 'Aker for the position.
He further stated: “ This is an uncomplicated procedure, lasting a few minutes,” adding: “ It is impossible not to relate to the inadequate process of accepting Dr. Abu 'Aker for the position.
The question arises whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the operation and the patient's death.
An experienced surgeon.
Israel Hayom was presented with information and claims by other senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised by Dr. Ronen Brenner in the case.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of Surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint, stating that Dr. Abu 'Aker is "one of the most experienced surgeons in Israel, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon".
He added that he was chosen in a proper tender and that Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements of his desire to "disconnect" from the chest unit.
He further stated: “ I wasn't a party to the procedure either, and maybe I should have been.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Feras Abu Akhar began working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace,” all the hospital doctors were impressed by his professionalism and motivation and willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of cases of a similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it sadly did.
Wolfson Hospital said in response: “ We share in the family's grief.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The thoracic surgeon mentioned in the article is a respected surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in the tender to manage the thoracic surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, his quoted words are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very serious condition.
The hospital is reviewing the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case.

Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of Sheba's Infectious Diseases Unit |
About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira.
The meeting that opened my eyes  and changed my life.
Had I not met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained an expert physician in internal medicine.
It was he who made me love infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue them.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, back in the 1980s.
For a moment I did not think that I would leave internal medicine, as I loved the treatment of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, also in internal medicine, and in fact in every area.
I thank him brought me to this field.
All along, I loved his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
Discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.
He was a real and honest person, devoid of ego, qualities that I loved about him very much.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Joseph Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go to medicine  but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.
Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day  for example, "tissue iz de ishio", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ makes it possible to know which drugs should be given; or "Won Yu Hughes It, Yu Hazel It", designed to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked at Hadassah and had two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven I cried.
He was something - a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his serious illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to treat epidemics, and he is sorely missed during this period.
If he were with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the epidemic treatment team.

Dr. Shlomi Kodesh, director of Soroka Hospital |
About the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors.

I met the late Prof. Shaul Suknik for the first time when I was a student in the fourth year of medical studies, and I came to a rotation in internal medicine in the 4th internal medicine department, which he managed.
Later I returned to the department also in the sixth year rotation, and the medical school thesis I did under his guidance, writing a computer simulation about a patient with polyarthritis ( inflammation of multiple joints) .
Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life over 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; Not only professionally, but also  and above all  personally and humanly.
During the internship, I debated family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about the choice of specialization.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him at Soroka.
During the internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways  in scientific writing ( sorry Saul, I wasn't persistent enough), in contact with patients, in working in a multi-professional team  an area in which the department excelled  and basically, in every aspect related to medicine  and basically, in every aspect related to medicine  and basically, in every aspect related to medicine  and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine  in a scientific writing ( sorry Saul, I haven't persisted enough) .
To this day, as a doctor and as a manager, I recognize characteristics that come from a question.
When I finished my internship and was debating whether to travel abroad, Shaul pushed and directed me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.
The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and push, I'm not sure it would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital's management, Shaul was again the one who supported and assisted.
Later, we managed complex periods together in the Internal Medicine Division.
Shaul knew how to integrate the teacher, the principal, the friend and the teammate wonderfully, without his different roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to be as successful as him in this special combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns who are now throughout the medical system in Israel, commemorating his memory and working with their excellent work and work.
I am honored to be part of this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of Schneider Children's Medical Center |
About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld.
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at the Schneider Pediatrics Center, taught me how to be an intensive care physician, but more than that, he taught me how to think about it - he taught me how to think about it.
The obvious thing I learned from him was to take care of the most complex, sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined that they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but it goes without saying.
But I learned even more meaningful and profound things from him.
Looking back, since I am a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, it is clear to me today that the connection between the worlds is clear; The education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: Listen to the children, listen to the monitor, listen to the nurses, young and old caregiver teams alike, and listen to the parents.
All this must be done not only in order to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but in order to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in child care exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and dialogue stimulate a deeper understanding, both on the part of the treating staff and on the part of patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at a complete system as well.
The more in-depth and rigorous understanding exists, which integrates all the treating factors into the discourse, the more accurate the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and especially early enough in order to prevent future, immediate or distant damage.
That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He's a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, listen  and then apply .

Medical malpractice in the different stages of childbirth
In order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence.
Childbirth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in the life of a family.
Unfortunately, however, births sometimes end in serious damage to the mother or newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where the birth ended in physical injury to the newborn or the mother, there is room to examine the chain of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in the field of medical malpractice will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, as he deems appropriate, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every error in treatment on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence ( in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.
When then is it negligence?
When the doctor's error was due to incompetence or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and incompetence and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.
In this article we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications may occur at each stage and when they arise to medical malpractice.
The contraction phase is contracted.
The contraction phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix opens gradually ( in order to allow the passage of the fetus during birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most cases of medical malpractice during labor involve failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes even manifested by cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy ( CP) :
Cerebral palsy may be caused by a failure to identify or delay in identifying perinatal asphyxia, which manifests itself in a failure to supply oxygen to the brain tissue of the fetus.
In general, monitoring the mother's condition and correct interpretation of the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical team to act quickly and extract the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.
Cases in which the medical staff ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or that the staff does not correctly interpret the data on its face and in particular the fetal monitor or responds late to the distress expressed by the monitor  may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by umbilical cord prolapse and uterine rupture that was not detected in time.
Even in these difficult events, it is worth clarifying whether the medical staff acted properly.
For example, attorney Anna Reif Lignese, of Caspi Srour & Co., a law firm specializing in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her firm handled a claim of a child injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the fetal head was too high, thus leading to umbilical cord prolapse ( when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain ( as a result of pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury to the fetal head) and being born with injury to the fetal head and being born with injury to the fetal head) and being born with injury to the fetal brain ( as a result of pressure on the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury to the fet
In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to severe medical negligence by the staff of the maternity ward at a large hospital, which during the birth did not identify clear signs at the time that required a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy.
The fetus that was ejected through the rupture of its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
We emphasize that in order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal link between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the asphyxiation and the damage caused to the newborn child, that is, that the damage was caused due to said negligence and not for any other reason or cause.
Examination of the causal relationship will be carried out through the examination of medical indicators that, according to the medical literature, only in their existence there is a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.
Among other things, the indicators of the level of acidity in the fetus's blood, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage and more are examined.
The death of the fetus.
The active birth stage is active.
The stage of active birth begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 cm and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Delay in childbirth and avoidance of caesarean section.
In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., lack of progression of the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a caesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.
“ There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner can cause irreversible damage to the fetus,” attorney Reif-Lignese explained to us,” she explained to us.
"For example, we conducted a medical malpractice lawsuit for the death of a newborn child caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.
Contrary to any known medical practice, the medical staff were not educated to identify the fetal distress and perform a caesarean section despite the particularly slow progress of childbirth.
The delay in performing the operation caused extensive systemic damage to the birth which finally led to her death shortly after her birth."
Negligence in vacuum birth.
In situations where the mother or fetus is in significant danger that requires a particularly rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth ( empty tube) is sometimes performed.
In this process, a "cap" is attached to the fetus' head using a vacuum and the fetus is forcefully pulled out by force.
Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great care, precision and skill, which requires great care, precision and skill.
In these cases, medical malpractice may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory guidelines and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for longer than permitted or when, despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more than the number of attempts allowed.
In these cases, if the negligent vacuum operation caused damage to the newborn  among other things, it could cause cranial damage and bleeding that could cause the development of brain damage  there is room for filing a tort claim.
Paralysis named after ERB.
Paralysis named after Erb, here is a congenital nerve injury to the brachial plexus ( nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric team.
The injury manifests itself in weakness of the hand muscles and can reach complete paralysis of the entire arm up to full paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of 'shoulder 3' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus' shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after the head has come out of the birth canal.
When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical malpractice?
In cases where the assessment of the weight of the fetus indicated that it is a macrosomic fetus, that is, that it is expected to be born with a weight greater than 4 weights. 5 kilograms and according to the guidelines it is better to give birth to the mother by caesarean section.
When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a caesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.
In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal fetal weight assessment or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder rupture and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical malpractice.
Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court held that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is concern of its occurrence, is to conduct a caesarean section."
Placental exit phase.
Separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the exit of the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.
In most cases, the process lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby leaves and usually occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the placenta exits, the medical team will check whether it has come out in its entirety or whether there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.
As part of this stage, complications may occur that can cause serious damage to the mother.
One of the well-known complications as a result of placental residues remaining in the uterus is called Asherman's syndrome, scarring of the uterine wall as a result of inflammation caused by placental residues remaining in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that makes it impossible to implant a pregnancy.
Therefore, in cases where the medical staff did not identify placental residues or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the endometrium despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, this may be medical malpractice and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field of the case.
The death of the mother is.
The death of a mother during childbirth is a fairly rare euro.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical staff does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or respond late to such bleeding.
“ For example, the company” .   ", Attorney Reif-Lignese told us, "Our firm filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a mother, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the mother's worrisome vital signs, for many hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the background disease from which she suffered."
“ In another case, in another case.   ", Attorney Reif-Lignese said, "Our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding originating from the cesarean section incision that was not sutured properly.
In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, responded late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death. ”
Loss of uterus.
In severe cases, medical malpractice at birth can lead to hysterectomy, says attorney Reif Lingze: “ Our firm conducted a lawsuit against a hospital based on hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.
In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after the birth, but no timely actions were taken that could have prevented the damage.
These are the compensations awarded in claims for medical malpractice in childbirth.
Newborn compensation for injury due to medical malpractice at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, salary and pension losses to the victim and even his parents, and other damage components.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.
In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adjusting housing to the baby's needs, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined in each case on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances, " says Attorney Reif-Lignese, and she adds that "Today most claims on the grounds of medical malpractice end in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk each party has in managing the procedure, " but the lawyer added that "there are cases where the procedure ends only with a verdict, then if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example, as part of a claim conducted by our firm, the district court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation exceeding ten million shekels", but added that "there are cases where the procedure ends only with a verdict, then if the claim is not rejected, the pla
To summarize, this is true.
Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney skilled in managing medical malpractice claims, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of keratoconus eye disease in the south.
A study has shown that there is a link between the development of the disease and the marriage of relatives.
The highest prevalence was found in the Bedouin sector.
Expert: "It is possible that in any sector with many weddings between cousins, we will find a high incidence of the disease"
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and to find correct solutions to prevent the situation from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted to help understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide research support for the suspicion that keratoconus eye disease is a genetic disease.
Recent research, which has dealt with transforming the shape of the cornea from a dome to a cone, revealed that the cause of the cornea's disease and weakness and its shape deformation is related to an enzymatic imbalance, as a result of which free radicals can damage the proteins in the cornea  and its structure will change.
The source of that lack of enzymes is genetic, a fact that reinforces the hypothesis that keratoconus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariella Gordon-Shag, Head of the Department of Optometry Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, "in a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of keratoconus of 3 was found. 2%.
The highest incidence was among students from the Bedouin sector - 20% had keratoconus, but there was a relatively small sample.
The researcher added that this was an unsurprising finding: “ There is a high incidence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies we found that close marriages are a risk factor for keratoconus disease.
So in any sector with a lot of weddings between cousins, we may find a high incidence."
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: In cases where there is a family history of keratoconus disease, all family members should get an appropriate eye exam as soon as possible.
According to Erza Fruchter, clinical optometrist B. Sc, "there are ten times as many requests to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, mainly from the southern region, compared to the center"
Fruchter adds, “ Over the past decade, I have noticed that most patients are turning from the periphery, especially from the Be 'er Sheva area.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriages within the family ( mainly in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of proper handling of the problem."
So how the disease is diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or in the late teens ( ages 16-15 or 20) .
The disease involves a decrease in vision, in parallel with an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients indicate distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over years, usually slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease may also develop rapidly and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many of the patients also indicate increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza, the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: “ Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel.”
Mahmoud Khair a-Din from the village of Hurfeish is a lieutenant colonel killed in an operation in Khan Yunis•
Head of Military Intelligence: “ He deserves the publicity, his family and his children” •
Later, the possibility of publishing the photo of Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from a patrol of the General Staff will be examined.
About three and a half years after the operation that involved Khan Yunis, the IDF today allows publication that the person killed in the operation, Lt. Col. M., is Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair a-Din from the village of Hurfeish in the north.
The 41-year-old was in Naples.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "It has been three and a half years since the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the country.
“ The late Mahmoud was a fighter in a paratrooper patrol and later grew up in the ranks of the army to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's Special Operations Division.
An Israeli hero who was posthumously decorated with the Chief of Staff's citation.
He further said: “ I eulogize him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and face of the hero of Israel, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hir al-Din, openly, Col. Mahmoud Hir al-Din.
The environment looked up to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has forbidden the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the Intelligence Directorate, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family members, it was decided to publish his name and picture, with the consent of his family members, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair a-Din, the hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Hurfeish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmad and a nun, and has seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahad and the father of two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the Special Operations Division of the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Khair ad-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him with its eyes on him.
Until ninth grade, he studied at the school in Kfar Hurfeish, and then moved to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997 he enlisted in a paratrooper patrol, and in 2000 graduated from officers' school.
In 2002, he was located by the Special Operations Division in Military Intelligence and moved to serve in it.
During his service, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002, he met his wife, Nahed, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the “ After Me” association and started guiding a group in the village of Hurfeish, after making sure that the association started operating in the Druze villages in order to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
The head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: “ For some time now, we have been turning on the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair a-Din, the hero of Israel.
We finished work and came to the conclusion that there is no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.
He also deserves it, his family and his children, " he noted.
“ An extraordinary educator and leader” .
“ Thanks to many operations, he is no less than a hero in my eyes,” said Maj. Gen. Haliva.
“ He has a significant contribution, which has courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He deserves to get the place that suits him.
And he added: “ I didn't know him personally, but he was an exceptional educator, educator and leader  not only on the operational side, but also in my values.”
Gen. Haliva noted that later he would also examine whether to publish the photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno of the General Staff, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not allowed to be published.
The operation in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018, on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of careful preparations in which the intelligence community took part in the action.
The command squad of the operation sat the then Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Gadi Eisenkot, the then head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heiman and the then head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been made public, and the IDF stressed that it was an invaluable intelligence operation.
But the Arab media retroactively presented communications equipment that, according to the Palestinians, had been left behind by the forces, according to the Palestinians.
According to Hamas, the operation was aimed at burying listening devices.
According to publications, on the day of the incident, the force drove two vehicles.
The fighters were detained at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas members, and something about their behavior aroused the suspicions of Hamas operatives.
Activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The interrogation on the ground lasted about 45 minutes, during which time it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair al-Din managed to distract Hamas members, and in that fraction of a second, the commander of the force, Lt. Col. A, managed to open fire.
Three Hamas operatives were killed by the fire, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.
Ten months after the difficult incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the IDF Committee and award the Chief of Staff's citation to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip - including Lt. Col. Khair al-Din, who also served in the area deep in the Gaza Strip.
The commander of the combat force and another fighter in the team also received a TLS citation.
The army said in a statement at the time that Lt. Col. M. received the citation for his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, in defense of his comrades, for the defense of his comrades.
Later, he acted out of initiative and striving for contact, took a forward role in taking over the enemy and acted resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider switching from tweezers operations to large-scale operations.
Israel should ask itself, once again, whether it is wrong to change its policy vis-à-vis the Jenin sector.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank in its wake, but Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
The stormy weekend shows that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the area is still more explosive than ever.
It will take great effort and common sense to safely cross the two upcoming mention dates: Today is Nakba Day ( Sunday), and Jerusalem Day will be celebrated in two weeks' time.
Quite a few factors will stand by in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
At their head, as always, are the terrorist elements, who are concentrating a special effort on trying to preserve the violent atmosphere of the past few weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the late YM fighter, Maj. Gen. Noam Raz, was killed yesterday.
Fighters who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they do not remember such a scope of shooting and violence  evidence not only of the tremendous amount of weapons on the ground, but also of the willingness to use them.
This requires Israel to ask itself, once again, whether it is wrong to change its policy vis-à-vis the Jenin sector, and to move from small, intelligence-based tweezers operations to a widespread, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena in its wake; even now, the security system prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid arson, but the Jenin militants may leave it no choice but to leave it the Jenin militants.
draw lessons for future events.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims to have deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqla.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and for those who are present at the scene, it is dangerous.
The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of fighters.
This indicates high morality, but it also has operational-intelligence value: A terrorist captured alive  as happened the other day in Jenin  is an excellent source of information about weapons, attacks and other terrorists; this is information that usually cannot be obtained in any other way, and through which future attacks can be thwarted.
The IDF acted correctly when it published its interim investigation into Abu Aqla's death yesterday, clarifying that at this stage it is not possible to determine who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the affair.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the convinced: The world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terrorism - the original reason for which the IDF is constantly operating in Jenin on its behalf.
As always, the nature of such stories is to die out.
World public opinion is busy with its own and moving on, certainly as a war continues to rage in Ukraine, a few times more intense.
Therefore, it is a pity that Israel insisted on giving Abu Aqla's death affair more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu Aqla's family did not meet the early summaries, one should have expected a little more restraint from the policemen who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less excited by the Palestinian flags waved in it.
Responsibility requires: Act to calm the situation.
Good did the Minister of Internal Security and the Police Commissioner who ordered an investigation into the incident.
It seems that he lacked sufficient preparation and clear guidelines, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
The Dizengoff attack also failed the police in managing the incident, isolating the scene and handling the media.
The investigation committee would do well if it not only analyzed the conduct of the police officers at the funeral itself, but also drew lessons and conclusions that would enable a more successful treatment of similar incidents in the future.
Alongside internal police treatment, he also undertakes to take into account the conduct of elected officials who have lost their way and direction.
The Israeli Knesset currently serves several members who appear to be a danger to democracy.
They are on both the left and the right, and take advantage of their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kasfer is the latest example of this; if no action is taken against him  including prosecution for assaulting a police officer  the state will implicitly encourage the next elected official to further radicalize his actions.
Such moves, which are considered a defensive democracy, are essential in the explosiveness of this period, with elements in the background that seek to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with common sense in his head is expected to rise above all of these, and act to calm the situation; Otherwise, Israel could quickly slide into escalation in the face of external enemies, and worse - in the face of domestic adversaries.
Senior police official: "Government policy and setting goals are required here"
The Israel Police has indeed launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal aliens, but the road is still long.
There is not a single factor in the State of Israel today that encompasses this whole issue." “
"If we want to deal with the phenomenon of illegal aliens, government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities must be derived.
Today, in the State of Israel, there is not a single factor that encompasses this whole issue, " a senior police official told Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, prior to the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon manifested itself in about 20, 000 to 30, 000 Shebaim who enter every day through the breaches in the fence.
In addition, between 100, 000 and 110, 000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel daily through 34 supervised crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each industry is limited by the quota set by the political echelon in accordance with the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, the NIS is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permitted permit quota.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were indeed considered prisoners, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security officials to monitor their movements.
“ Therefore, their entry through the breaches in the fence is meaningless,” says a senior security official, “ Anyone who wants to carry out an attack can also enter Israel through the supervised crossings, and there have been such cases in the past, and there have been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests.
Following the attack in Elad and in light of the large number of warnings of attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal aliens.
By the end of the week, about 16, 000 Shebaim were arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases were opened for them, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the policy of the police prosecution, proceedings against illegal aliens are carried out only against prone criminals or people who repeatedly repeat the act ( recidivists) .
An illegal alien arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes this is repeated a second time as well, but only the third time he is arrested, imprisoned and indicted for illegal stay.
According to the law, if an illegal alien is caught within a range of about 50 to 100 meters on each side of the separation fence, his treatment is carried out by the military prosecution.
Data reached by Israel Hayom shows that in 2021, 40, 010 illegal residents, drivers and squatters were treated by the police.
7, 405 illegal aliens were arrested and a criminal case was opened for 19, 533 years.
The number of employers, transporters and accomplices handled by the police in 2021 was 6, 6071.
469 were arrested, and 5, 640 criminal cases were opened.
“ The foundations of the Shabaim phenomenon do not depend on the police, not on the IDF, not on Israeli society, not on Palestinian society, nor on Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors, " says a senior law enforcement official.
“ In order to address the phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be sterilized, and on the Israeli side, a price must be charged to prevent them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the matter claim that the failure to collect the price is due, among other things, to a lack of prison places and the fact that arrests are carried out only when there are related offenses or that the recidivist is involved.
Legal sources claim that the decision to charge a price only from the beginning of his third arrest was made, among other things, because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests carried out every day.
Whoever examines the punishment as well, will find that it does not deter." “
There is great complexity.
Sheba, " says a police source, "is a complex person."
He can be the father of a family who enters the country to work to earn a few shekels and return.
This is the basic platform, and on it are dressed many types of prisoners who enter the country in order to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks."
The NIS can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, illegal 16-year-olds were caught by the police and even 8- and 10-year-olds are sent by their parents to road junctions, in order to earn a few shekels a day from drivers per day.
"It also makes the matter complex, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and indict them for neglect, " says a senior police officer, saying.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed Shebaim in garbage removal, mainly in the north, who were employing Shebaim in garbage removal.
Out of 34 crossings, there are about 18 central crossings.
There are crossings for vehicles and goods, there are crossings through which only people pass, and there are crossings that are both and both.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.
The Sheba'im are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as this is easy money.
"There are those who do this for a living, and there are gangs whose main occupation is transporting prisoners, " says a senior police official, "usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them."
It can reach NIS 100 to NIS 300 per person.
Registered companies do not deal with this, because if the company is caught, it will be judged to be closed” .
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting prisoners can be considered an offense.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at regular points and at regular times, including a regular order, is not breaking the law, " says a senior police official, "Anyone who knows he is transporting prisoners usually picks them up in the middle of the night at hiding places, including dropping them off at hidden spots, including dropping them off in hidden spots."
Most of these guys drive a half-assed car because they know we're going to impound their car so they'd rather ride in an old car"

"A criminal investigation should be opened against her": The Haifa City Comptroller made serious accusations against Einat Kalish Rotem on serious charges.
The city comptroller's report presents an alleged concern for criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former city officials and political opponents: Monitoring of employees and inflated payment to an accountant's office for conducting investigations•
“ The difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation.”
Haifa Municipality did not respond to a response.
Municipal employees and political opponents are monitored and an inflated payment to an accountant's office for conducting the investigations, “ at the expense of the public purse”,
Haifa Municipality Comptroller Ofer Tal's report, published Tuesday, presents alleged concern for criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
Kalish allegedly met with the accounting firm Barlev & Co. and asked to conduct an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to Councilwoman Sophie Nakash, examining whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash's family were strictly kosher.
The auditor's report also shows that there is disorder and complete lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to coordinate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant has not been transferred to him.
This has meant that no one in the municipality is aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what is the required scope of work in each of them?
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation has arisen in which the scope of issues in which the accountant has been involved has grown disproportionately, with a great deal of interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring on the part of the municipality.
In conclusion, the audit recommended stopping the unpaid payments to the accountant, until material detailing his work on each of the issues examined was received.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were under codes such as "gatekeepers", information shop, fish shop, investigative audit of the mayor and procurement investigative audit report.
Shortly thereafter, the municipality's attorney, Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor herself signed the approval of the payment in her place.
“ Wasn't commissioned by any audit report and I don't know what it is about,” she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remain to be paid, from the tax money of the Haifa public.
Former City Treasurer Jackie Wakim responded: “ These despicable actions carried out for the purpose of tarnishing the name of elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the Haifa taxpayer is a criminal offense and is a criminal offense. “
City Councilwoman Sophie Nakash in her response: “ The auditor's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves. “
Haifa City Council Member Sarit Golan's response: The evidence and the difficult findings arising from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the Investigative Review Counsel to carry out investigations, some of which are doubtful as to whether they are permitted by law in the manner in which they were carried out, and in particular the investigations concerning the opposition councilwoman to the mayor and former senior employees."
Lior Datz's response from the “ Gatekeepers” association: “ It seems that all the red lines have been crossed that a public authority sends investigators details in order to gather information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption and while the association conducts public proceedings against the Haifa municipal administration.”
Haifa Municipality did not respond to a response.

Gantz revealed: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm UNIFIL's activity in Lebanon"
The Defense Minister participated in the international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their modes of operation"•
Gantz referred, among other things, to al-Sayed's documentation in Hamas captivity: “ A video aimed at blackmailing  on the back of a humanitarian issue” •
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke this morning ( Wednesday) at the International Cyber Center's Cyber Center conference at Tel Aviv University where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, “ further harm by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country,” Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hisham al-Sayed, held captive by Hamas in Gaza, released by the terrorist organization's military arm: “ Yesterday, a video aimed at blackmail was published on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four boys captive in violation of international law, contrary to morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal behavior of Hamas.
He added, "The State of Israel operates by a variety of means, and continues to turn every stone in order to bring the boys home."
As we have said in the past, this is a humanitarian issue, that's how we see it, and on this basis we will continue to act on this basis.
Attempts at blackmail and mind exercises will not affect our position and conduct.”
He later revealed the joint activity of Iran and Hezbollah: “ Iran also operates its proxies in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recently the activity of the Iranian security bodies in cooperation with Hezbollah was detected in order to harm the activity of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon in order to harm the activity of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This is by carrying out a cyber operation whose purpose was to steal materials about UNIFIL's deployment in the area, and their use by Hezbollah.
This is another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon, and to Lebanon's stability."
“ Israel is familiar with its adversaries' cyber systems and their modes of operation.
In recent years, we have seen the phenomenon of Iranian hacker groups operating against Israel and other countries, " Gantz continued, saying.
“ The New Shippers are terrorists with keyboards who are just as convicted of being fighters of other terrorist organizations as they are of other terrorist organizations.”
We know who they are, we hurt them and their senders, and even today they are in our crosshairs  and not only in the cyber dimension.
No attack against Israeli citizens will be on the agenda.
And the responsibility lies with the attackers and the state that finances and sends them.
A cyberattack can be answered in a variety of ways in cyberspace and in other spaces."
Gantz continued his attack on the nuclear power: “ Iran is leading cyber terrorism  and making moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the U.S. presidential elections and other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Actions such as that of the Shahid Kaveh unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under the direct directive of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in the investigations."
He added, “ In recent years, we have stopped many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber responsibility, ' and to punish companies and entities that do not act in accordance with the guidelines.
Gantz went on to mark Israel's following targets in the face of the threats: “ Our supreme mission, in the army, in the industries and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
I and the Chief of Staff have placed this issue as one of the main tasks in the relevant units.
We are constantly examining force build-up  both in terms of manpower, training and missions.
In the coming years, we will also need to examine the form of organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system."
Finally, the Minister of Defense concluded by calling for cooperation with the world: “ Our cooperation with the world vis-à-vis Iran is of great importance even in the cyber dimension.
The same collaborations that we are building in the region vis-à-vis Iran in aspects of defense against various threats  we are also expanding in the cyber dimension."
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems"
Uri, deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit's first public appearance at conferences of this type, revealed that Israel had thwarted an attack on the water systems.
" Countering cyber threats is a key part of our operations.
Our goal is to gain supremacy over the attacker, to be able to identify him and to act to negate his abilities, " said the deputy commander of 8200, adding, "this is how sometimes we also find victims outside Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary."
We do this both independently and through cooperation with industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of the tools we have developed and through the implementation and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed"
As mentioned, this exposed a threat to Israel's water systems and attempts to poison the citizens of Israel: “ We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them a few years ago.
In another case we also identified that a certain adversary attacked Israel, and in the process we identified that the same attacker also tried to target power plants in the United States.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We have been able to prevent this threat through close cooperation with our American partners."
Watch: This is how the police are preparing to eliminate terrorists in the civilian population.
The Jerusalem Border Police inaugurates a new facility "Assaf" that simulates shooting in a crowded crowd in response to the series of attacks in recent months•
Border Police Counterterrorism Guide near Jerusalem: “ The development provides a relevant response to the attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground.”
A glimpse of the "Assaf" facility.
Preparing for the next attack: A series of terrorist attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, during which 19 people were murdered and about 70 civilians were wounded, led the Border Police to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to storm terrorists within a civilian population and carry out shooting in traffic.
Israel Hayom exposed: A glimpse of the "Assaf" facility.
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary to lead a normal life of a civilian population.
The severe wave of attacks that took place this year, with attacks in Be 'er Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who was assimilated into a crowd, led the police to think creatively in order to develop a tool that could be used to train fighters to storm terrorists within the civilian population.
The work of thinking was led by the training division of the police and the Border Police Department.
These emerged in competition in the various police districts under the title "Commanders Leading Learning", in which each district was required to develop measures that would help improve the policing and fighting skills of the fighters, police officers and commanders.
As part of the competition, and as a response to the need to train Border Police fighters for combat in shooting training on the move and in this type of descriptions, Assaf Ben David, Border Police counter-terrorism instructor near Jerusalem, developed the Assaf facility, consisting of a dynamic target, which is connected to a telescopic pole on which a carrier can be harnessed to guide, which can be harnessed to guide.
Their servant guides the carrier to our death, he can practice the warrior standing in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Police fighters have faced many attacks in which the perpetrator shoots and poses a threat while moving in arenas saturated with innocent civilians.
The Assaf facility, in its current version, is based on components and parts used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic rod that was upgraded and integrated into the facility, was taken from the field of maintenance and cleaning.
Using the facility, it is possible to simulate shooting in motion within a civilian population at a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling a traffic stop, choosing a path of progress, performing selective shooting, including practicing preventing injury to uninvolved civilians.
Major Assaf Ben David, after whom the facility is named, says: “ The facility we developed is a breakthrough in learning and training fighters and police officers.
The development provides a relevant response to the attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of development in the face of the relatively cheap cost of production is a significant advantage for us in the competition."
The State Comptroller warns: “ The Central Election Commission is not prepared for cyber threats” .
Netanyahu Engelman warned at International Cyber Week about Israel's lack of preparedness for bomb attacks•
“ World War III will be a hacker war, but the world is not prepared for it.”
State Comptroller Matanyahu Engelman participated today ( Wednesday) in Tel Aviv University's annual cyber conference and expressed concern about cyberattacks on Israel.
“ We are exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it."
Engelman said that as part of the cyber audits his office conducts, significant deficiencies were found: “ In the past year, we have carried out penetration tests at the movement management center in Jerusalem, in hospitals and in the Tax Authority systems.
In the audits, we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were performed by public bodies and some conducted penetration tests only during the audit.
In addition, there were deficiencies in the Central Election Commission's preparedness for cyber threats.
"We at the State Comptroller's Office undertake to continue to address this significant issue even more strongly, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world, " he concluded.
Aiming high: “ I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles.”
The choice of red: "From the first moment they showed me that they wanted me, I was built to lead a large group"•
Return to the Israeli national team after four years: "I felt like I had a place, wanting to be on the roster for Eurobasket"•
And the period at Maccabi Tel Aviv: "I learned to concentrate only on what is in my control"•
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will leave today with the players of the Israeli national team to Poland, where they will meet the local team in the 2023 World Championship qualifiers ( Thursday, 21:30 Israel time) .
Three days later, the team will host Estonia at the Shlomo Group Arena.
In addition to intensive training with the national team, Blazer also dealt with his future in the past week, until he signed for two years at Hapoel Jerusalem, signing for Hapoel Jerusalem.
"I have peace of mind now that I've found a team, " he told Israel Hayom in his first and special interview since signing, " he told Israel Hayom in a first special interview since signing.
"I have a bit of pressure now because I have to move with my family after settling in the central area and it's not easy, but there are no phones anymore and professionally I'm much calmer."
You haven't been on the national team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
“ First of all, I want to enjoy the national team and I come with the attitude of contributing in whatever way I can, whether it's from my experience or whether it's on the field or not.
Of course I would love to play, but when it comes to the national team, everyone has to put their egos aside and do everything in order for the team to succeed.
I'm here for whatever they need from me."
Now you are 14 players, and Dani Avdia will join the European Championship, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and there may also be other changes.
You set the goal of being on the roster for the championship.
“ I would love to be on the field and contribute” .
29-year-old Blazer ( 1) . 99m) He has played for Maccabi Tel Aviv for the past two years.
When the season ended it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring Jerusalemites over Hapoel Holon to Hapoel Holon.
You had other suggestions, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
“ They showed a great willingness for me to be there, so negotiations were relatively easy.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I realized that this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and appropriate to me.
I come to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I've spoken to the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and winning, and that's exactly what I bring.
I have always loved playing in the Arena, because I get energies even if the crowd is against me, and now that they will be on my side it will be even better.
I'm sure there will be a committed and fun team and I wanted to be a part of that."
Expand a little on your conversation with Coach Dzikic.
"Professionally he believes in a lot of movement without a ball, he plans to bring good morals with I.I. The basketball team is high and you want a very intense team.
He believes in high energies in defense and attack and with the Arena crowd it can be successful"
I looked at your career and saw that in every team you stay at least two years, if not more.
You feel that even in Jerusalem you can stay for a few years.
"Everywhere I go I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone kept ringing and beeping.
I've received a lot of messages that are already waiting for me.
So I believe that a good time awaits us"
You think in Jerusalem you could be a more significant player than in Maccabi Tel Aviv.
How do you summarize the two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv?
"Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional every step of the way, and no matter how much I got  I always gave everything back.
I'm proud of the way I've done this past year, and now everyone is going their own way.
If it were up to you, you would want to stay at Maccabi.
“ After the last year, it was clear to both sides that we were going in the direction of separation, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I hurt a bit in minutes and my status dropped, although in the middle of the year I had a great time, but they decided to go in other directions, but they decided to go in different directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized that this was less the place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it.
Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the semi-finals of the Cup last season when I shouted to Ami Biton ( the team manager at Maccabi Tel Aviv) 'That's what I'm here for, ' so that's why I came to Jerusalem  to take titles."

All or Nothing: 1:1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera.
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but managed to make amends with equality 10 minutes later•
Subsequently, the contact was removed in questionable red ( 74) •
Hadera also remained with ten players following Red's duty to Ido Levy ( 87) .
Hapoel Jerusalem's professional staff counted the number of foreigners on the pitch at Teddy this evening, much more than once, it should be noted, and at one point they even discovered one less player ( Guy Hadida was sent off) .
This time, to their delight, everything was well, and the 1:1 they achieved against Hapoel Hadera will not be taken away from them by the association's court.
Before Hadida's red, he managed to score an own goal and compare to arrange a precious point for Ziv Arie.
Already at the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida's private show began.
Falkushchenko charged wide, and the midfielder rose and rammed backwards and the ball stopped in his team's net.
0:1 to her room who enjoyed an own goal by the midfielder.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida managed to make amends and Lebkovic caught air and the midfielder this time rammed into the right exposed network.

In the 87th minute, Bar Natan also sent Ido Levy in red and balanced the balance of power on the grass as well.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon.
60:85:
Ariel Beit Halahmi's team composed a third win in a row, this time particularly impressive •
Huber and Shuchman ( 15 each) excelled.
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey continues tonight ( Saturday night) with an impressive 60:85 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a seasonal 0:3 balance in the meetings between the two.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel Beit Halahmi's team has already had three consecutive victories, and in fact this is a surprise only for those who did not foresee in the game.
We haven't seen such bad weather in a long time.
All this before the opening of the series against Besiktas in the Palein in the Champions Cup: Only 60 points, a first half without a three-pointer and 11 percent for a three-pointer in the entire game.
Bottom line is an unimpressive evening for all of the team's players ( except Murphy Manko, who scored Holon's 3 three-pointers), including the safe stock Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in very good shape thanks to Roy Huber and Joaquin Shuchman ( 15 points each) .
The first came back to itself in recent times and the second returned to flourish and also amazed with a basket from three-quarters of the court.
Give them a chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv's Israelis saved Spropoulos.
After a loss in the derby and eighth in a row in Europe, a defeat in the Clasico against Jerusalem would probably have ended the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach • Probably, the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach would have ended.
So who Yannis has to send a bouquet of flowers tonight.
To his Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points at the Arena•
And also: Why does the Yellow Club need to change its 'Americanization strategy', and take a vivid example from Ariel Beit Halahmi's model in Eilat.
It's hard to remain cynical at the sight of the tearful eyes and the warm and strong hugs that Giannis Spropoulos gave his players at the end of tonight's game at the Arena, and especially in the face of the tight grip and secret exchange with John DiBartolmao, who single-handedly saved the Greek coach the job, and perhaps the entire season as a whole, and perhaps the Greek coach.
Because after a home loss in the derby and eighth in a row in Europe, we will also lose in the Clasico to Jerusalem and move away from it to three wins in the table.
This would have already ended the Israeli-Greek novel tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also and actually mainly about the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change in attack and ball movement habits.
The ball moved with dedication, with a lot of movement and exercises, and Scotty Wilbekin, demonstratively, left the work of concentration to Evans, dribbled very little, and mostly passed on blocks and went out for shots to take shots.
Despite scoring very badly ( 2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed defensively, and above all, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored, scoring by the players.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team reverted to the old habits, and the attacks reverted back to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a 2 lead and 40 seconds to the end, Scotty dribbled himself to half a corner and threw a floater on one leg that almost lost the game.
The trick is to keep playing exercises and a dedication movement precisely in the moments of the clutch, and this has to go into nature and group DNA.
The important learning will be done by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who became water cleaners and towel-wavers at European games.
Tonight they scored more than half of the team's points ( 42 out of 83) for the coach who stopped believing in them, and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end of the game.
Four of Maccabi's top five scenes were its Israelis.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague as well.
In the first half it was mostly Oz Blazer, who has been screaming for a month that he must play more.
A shooter, a moralist, a fighter under the baskets ( 7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.
It isn't enough.
The second half featured Jake Cohen, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, covering for Žižić's injury, and especially John Dee, who at 70:63 for Jerusalem changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.
Yanis has a complicated relationship with Yiftach Ziv, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and burdens him too much, to the point of risking losing.
It's happening in the Euroleague as well, and it happened tonight as well.
But the important learning should be the club's, regarding its Americanisation strategy.
Fact: The senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Debrat chooses Jerusalem, or maybe rejected by Maccabi.
And this is happening because there are gradually fewer places left for Israelis in Maccabi, because of the club's informed and rooted choice to be based on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play it, and then it will look for Jewish children to become citizens, and pressure the administration/union to further increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake on the part of the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it exaggerates with the foreigners, a lot because of the tax discount.
We certainly won't argue that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones, five excellent ones, instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediocre ones.
For example this season, with the money of Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, it was possible to bring in two efficient and stable stars ( a star point guard and a super forward) next to Scotty and Žižić.
It will be more effective, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and generates identification.
It is true that there are two busy frameworks and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis, so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which purports to represent Israel, and even receive tax relief from the state for its so-called representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association/League Manager can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 on form, maximum three on the field at the same time at the same time.
For the ongoing failed achievements ( for seven years in Europe), just for Maccabi, the league is flooded with foreigners.
And the players' organization, what about you?
That's what you guys were for on Saturday.
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there is one.
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargain to get less.
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in this direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and another 4 Israelis who were only two in the junior teams ( Huber, Ben Moshe, Ruina and Shuchman the fighter), she dismantled Holon ( second in the table) ( second in the table) . ) For the second time in the last two weeks.
It is a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run even in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot in the days of Sharon Drucker.
Short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is nothing like Ariel Beit Halahmi, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us of what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their peak of strength, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The foreigners only supplement.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from a hamstring injury, it's going to be a tremendous team.
A song I dreamed of Eilat.
And that Maccabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "There was a feeling that the whole world was against us"
The Yellows are happy after 78:83 on Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena: "We are back playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play"•
About Ami Biton's conversation in the locker room, the first optimistic diagnosis of Žižić's injury and management's approval of procurement.
A great sense of relief is recorded this morning ( Sunday) among Maccabi Tel Aviv after yesterday's important and prestigious 78:83 at the Arena against Hapoel Jerusalem.
The team's players and management hugged coach Giannis Spropoulos, who seemed very excited at the end of the game.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer enthusiastically poured water on Derrick Williams, who excelled in the game, and the rest of the club also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the recent losing streak.
They, too, feared defeat against the great rival that would further destabilize the system.
The fans also stayed for long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
“ We have an amazing connection between us and Yanis in the dressing room,” Oz Blazer said.
“ We know the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We've been looking forward to it a lot, even in the way we played.
We are back to playing in a way that Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with heart and fight, we stand behind him, we stand behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us."
Before the game, the team manager Ami Biton entered the dressing room and gave exciting words to the players.
"His words had a great impact on how we came out and how we played on the court, " Maccabi players said.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi are already aiming for the important game against Basconia on Thursday and want to interrupt the long losing streak in the EuroLeague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us, " Blazer added, adding that Blazer.
“ We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
“ In the last few games we have been under a lot of pressure, Giannis told us that if we are released we will win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
Many eyes were on us and it was a feeling of the whole world against us, I am proud to go to this war, we cut off everything around us and look only at ourselves. ”
Ante Žižić, who injured his right knee during the last quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
Doctors will check how the knee will react today and then it will become clear how many days of rest he will need to recover to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Basconia.
Apart from the firm backing given by the management to Spropoulos and the professional team, at a meeting held on Thursday, professional manager Nikola Vujcic was given the green light to bring in one or two players to strengthen the team, and the Yellows hope to add quality procurement soon.

Research states: Zoom meetings hurt creativity.
About 2, 100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem  some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings•
Result: A virtual meeting harms creativity and thinking outside the box•
Study Leader at Columbia University: “ The visual focus on the screen impairs the process of creating ideas” •
Nechama Forta: There is no harm to labor productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the effect of meetings through video software on participants' creativity, compared to face-to-face meetings held in nature, compared to face-to-face meetings.
Unfortunately, it has been found that creativity does suffer in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question  led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University  was whether remote meetings using a computer preserve the creativity of office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of the distance.
The study itself began as early as 2016 but received a big boost in the two years of coronavirus, during which many employees moved to work from home.
“ People in a personal meeting move around the room, use objects and use them for creative thinking,” says Brooks.
“ In a computer session, on the other hand, the concentration on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more video-focused when interacting, which impairs the broad and expansive idea generation process.
Space is shrinking.
To test the results of the experiment and verify whether they would repeat themselves, they were tested twice  once at Columbia University and once in real life  on engineers who knew each other from early acquaintance.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts  in one the subjects were asked to meet personally and develop solutions to the problem, and in the other they were asked to do so through a computer.
At the same time, 1, 490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide in a similar way and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking was found among those who met virtually on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher on ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people often look at their surroundings to help generate ideas, while in a video session thinking converges on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity to be possible.
“ When the people are in the same room, they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can evoke new associations in them.
On the other hand, research shows that relationships through a computer change our attention so that we are more focused inward and on the screen, and this reduces innovation and idea generation through looking at the environment and thinking outward.
There is no harm to critical thinking.
However, before managers run employees back to the office, the researchers note that “ working through a computer did not harm productivity itself nor people's critical thinking about innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
In other words, the damage is focused solely on creativity and not on the other forms of working with a computer."
Professor Alan Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also qualifies the findings as similar.
According to her, "there is a difference between mere creativity, such as new uses for frisbee ( one of the research questions; EG) and solutions of work."
It's also possible that when employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or when they work from home, creativity will improve."
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also proposed future research in which such meetings would be stopped for thinking and wandering situations in the room to see how this activity would affect the final outcome.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study, only brainstorming sessions would allow employees to return to work, and generally suggested not to be alarmed by one study, but to conduct another investigation in the field.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forced back and not be happy, that's a bigger blow, " he says.
Musk is waiting for Trump to return: “ It wasn't right to block him.”
Twitter's new buyer said he would reverse the decision, which led to the former US president's account being blocked.
“ I think it was a mistake,” he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter in a deal valued at $44 billion, said Tuesday that he intends to return Trump to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after rioting by his supporters on Capital Hill after losing the election to the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, who later said he was aiming to return him to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after riots by his supporters on Capital Hill after the election loss to the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.
“ I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake, ” he said.
“ If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and a suspension  a temporary suspension  is appropriate, but not a permanent ban,” Musk clarified.
By 2050: The world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture.
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years•
Solution: Proper management of water reservoirs.
A new and disturbing study recently published in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050 the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and world population growth remain at their current usage trends.
In the study, in which scientists from all the world's scientific agencies participated, the scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers and fresh water sources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The grim conclusions of the study show that currently, the rate of water consumption has repeatedly doubled in the last 10 years, while at the same time global warming causes rainfall to decrease in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study's data, 84% of the world's agricultural land will experience a severe shortage of rainwater.
One of the main conclusions that emerged from the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and the seasons, and to switch to growing methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the water evaporation process that will lead to widespread waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater collection technologies in order to prevent their flow into the sea.
Information about many students from Bar Ilan University was leaked online.
Hackers who attacked the database of Bar-Ilan University a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about the students if they did not receive a ransom.
The threat was realized and the information was published throughout the network.
Students at Bar Ilan University are under attack by hackers when their personal information is posted across the network by a network attacker known as Darkrypt who issued a ransom demand a few weeks ago from the university's personnel and threatened that if he was not paid an unclear amount of money, he would publish the information under his control.
Estimates of the amount of money demanded by the attacker are that it was an amount that started in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked, it increased and before the information was published it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are full of angry messages and the mess is celebrating there, with students unable to access their personal information systems and unable to perform routine student assignments.
The university sent an e-mail announcing the attack on the academic institution and that they were working intensively to reduce the damage, detailing some of the information that leaked online.
No special instructions were given to those whose information was hacked and it was said there that the university carried out a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's servers.
In a row for 40 settlements: The optical fiber comes to Binyamin.
The trend of networking in the periphery on the Internet continues and now the optical fiber reaches the Binyamin Council, which includes 40 communities•

I would like to wish success to the dear companies in the implementation tasks in the communities.
The residents are waiting for you.
Gantz added: “ Soon we will have proper conditions of the best high-speed internet in Israel.
We worked for many months to bring a basis for the fiber installation and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank Minister of Communications Yoaz Hendel who started the project with us in his previous term and now we are reaping the fruits of the labor, the staff of the Minister of Communications, the Council members who were in charge of the details of the Center and the CEOs of the companies that won the Center for the best professional quality in Israel. “
CEO of Internet Rimon, a Farr rival: “ I thank Mayor Israel Gantz and his team for immediately lifting the gauntlet in order to bring good news to the thousands of residents of the council who will switch to using high-speed internet that will upgrade the quality of life in the fields of education, the economy and, of course, leisure. “
CEO of Telran Communications Group, Shai Aslan: “ We are pleased with the Binyamin Council's decision to connect to fast and powerful internet infrastructures and I am sure that thanks to the group's extensive experience, we will be able to provide residents with high-speed internet just like in the center of the country. “

We checked: What do the side effects after the COVID-19 vaccine say?
Many people who are vaccinated feel weak, feverish, and tired after receiving the injection, while others feel nothing at all.
Could this indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these symptoms, or is this a baseless rumor?
While more and more people are getting vaccinated, the lack of information about the side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are untrue, most of which are untrue.
Is the immune system of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies reacted less severely to the vaccine, which may prove that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body entering the body?
"There are several levels of responses to the vaccine, " says Dr. David Dvir, head of the Division of Primary Medicine at UNITED and a member of the Advisory Committee on PTSD ( epidemic treatment team), reassuringly: "Headaches, fatigue, local pain, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body reacts to the entry of a foreign body into the system"
There is a link between the levels of antibodies that develop and the side effects.
"There is no correlation between sensations and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 60%  50% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
It was not found that people who developed strong reactions were more protected"
“ In the medical literature, there is no correlation between immediate response and vaccination level.
In some trials where people were also given placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
This is also a mental component  how the person perceives the vaccine, if he expects there to be side effects.
Many of the phenomena that happen could also happen normally, but since the public has been vaccinated, it attributes the response to the vaccine itself, and this is a bias that you see regarding vaccines in general  attributing phenomena that happen close to the vaccine and are attributed to it” .
According to Dr. Dvir, the causes of the commonly reported symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions are divided.
“ There are all kinds of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One theory is that it's a strong immune response."
There is in general a possibility to assess the strength of an immune system.
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, they showed that those who did not sleep or who were under higher pressure were more vulnerable to infection.
Apart from this, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there is a decrease in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone walks around with a weak immune system and isn't aware of it so much.
These are people who come to inquiries because of repeated events of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: Stress, nutrition, sleep, and other things: Stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want an immune system that is too strong, because it can cause autoimmune diseases."
MRNA vaccines will soon appear in additional contexts, thanks to the vast knowledge that has accumulated about them in recent times.
“ There is no doubt that an opening will be paved for other vaccines of this kind.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines  for treatments of oncological diseases, for example, oncological diseases.
Their effectiveness is that the substance stays in the body for very little time - enters, does its action, and then breaks down, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it has received a serious boost due to the very great need for a rapid vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week interval between doses is too small, and some vaccine experts claim that after the third dose we may not need another vaccine in the near term, so it is not clear whether we are going to be vaccinated every six months or whether the third dose will give a larger margin."
Thousands were affected: Serious privacy default on Route 6

Saudi Arabia's skies are approaching: Israeli companies are preparing to strengthen lines to the East.
The emerging summary for extended flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe.
Israel's largest airline is planning major changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we published in Israel Hayom, it is estimated Biden will announce approval for El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the United Arab Emirates.
The emerging agreement means that El Al will be able to fly shorter routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.
To do this, the company will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, in order to free up planes in favor of new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations where there is a fairly small Jewish population, but at this stage they are less profitable for society.
On the other hand, El Al's new destinations are Tokyo, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
Here's how the move will be made: Dreamliners flying to Canada will be released in favor of long-haul flights to the East.
The Boeing 737 aircraft flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which El Al operates flights using Dreamliner aircraft.
So basically the company will be able to release large planes to fly to other destinations in the East.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to return to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Exempt from isolation for vaccinated and recovering from non-red countries, foreign tourists return.
Landers in Israel received notices from the Ministry of Health stating that they are exempt from the obligation of isolation upon receiving a negative COVID-19 test result.
Only afterwards did the ministry issue an official statement stating that only passengers from orange countries were involved, although returnees from red countries also reported receiving the message•
In addition: Tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and it is expected that many red destinations will be removed from the list.
At the height of the pandemic  the end to isolation for returning from abroad.
The Ministry of Health sent notices to those returning to Israel on Monday morning, stating that they are exempt from isolation upon receiving a negative response to the COVID-19 test they performed after landing in Israel.
These are also returnees from red states.
Some of the messages sent informed returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative response or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative response.
Only afterwards did the Ministry of Health issue official announcements stating that starting at midnight at 4:00 p.m. tonight, it is said that 4 p.m. 1 In 2022, vaccinated or recovering, those returning from orange countries will perform a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and enter isolation for 24 hours or until receiving a negative result ( whichever comes first) .
The decision will be anchored in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be submitted for approval to the Knesset Health Committee of the Knesset.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovering individuals who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they performed upon entering Israel, will end the isolation tonight at midnight and are not obliged to perform a second test and are not obliged to perform a second test at midnight.
However, travelers from red states reported receiving the message as well.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and returned from an orange country, will enter home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening isolation upon receiving a negative pcr test result performed starting on the 7th day of landing in Israel ( landing day is the first day) .
The decision to remove most restrictions on flights and especially on the vaccinated comes a day before the High Court hearing submitted by the Travel Agencies Association, the Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotel Association.
At the hearing that will take place tomorrow, petitioners are expected to demand that all other red states be removed from the list, with the one who backs them up in his opinion being Professor Itamar Grotto.
Foreigners will also be able to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transport have agreed that starting on Sunday 9th, starting on Sunday 9. 1 In 2022, vaccinated/recovered foreigners ( according to the Ministry of Health's definition) from orange countries will be allowed to enter  subject to filling out an online form ahead of time, performing a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, performing a PCR test upon entering Israel followed by entering isolation for 24 hours or receiving a negative test result ( whichever comes first) .
Unvaccinated/non-recovered foreigners ( as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red states, except for those whose entry has been approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The outline of the groups will not be renewed at this stage.
And what about red states?
The State Classification Committee at the Ministry of Health recommends that the government remove the following countries from the list of red countries and transfer them to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada, Canada, the Commission recommends removing them from the list of red countries: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada, Canada, the Commission recommends removing them from the list of red countries and transferring them to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada, South Africa, Canada, Canada.
The remaining countries at this point in the list of red countries: United Arab Emirates, USA, Ethiopia, United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option being considered by the Ministry of Health is to exempt from isolation those vaccinated returning from red countries.
At the moment, it is unclear whether there is a connection between the messages received this morning by those returning to Israel and the guidelines that may be received by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
The Department of Health has not yet received a response.
The sky is beginning to open: The Ministry of Health changes the restrictions on the gates of the country.
Vaccinated persons returning from orange countries will be charged with 24-hour isolation•
The countries USA, Turkey, Great Britain and the United Arab Emirates will be defined as red.
After many weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to fly to without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were charged with isolation, along with a ban on tourists entering Israel, yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend canceling the three-day quarantine requirement for Israelis returning from orange countries.
So far, any vaccinated or recovering according to the Ministry of Health's definition who returned from an orange country has been charged with isolation for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Now, the isolation that vaccinators and convalescents returning from orange countries will have to enter is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of coronavirus tests performed after landing at Ben Gurion Airport ( whichever comes first) are received
Those who are not defined as vaccinated or recovering will still be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two COVID-19 tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if they returned from an orange country and if they returned from a red country.
A vaccinated or convalescing person returning from a red state must also be in complete isolation.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to be approved by the government, includes the United States, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, except Turkey, the average number of positives entering the country in the last two weeks is more than 5% of total arrivals, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase among patients from Turkey is fast, the rate of positive returns from Turkey is just over 4%, so it was decided to put it on the list of red countries as well, and therefore it was decided to include it in the list of red countries.
Notable countries that will be removed from the list of red states: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, as of January 9, tourists vaccinated according to Ministry of Health requirements will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, similar to the conditions for Israelis returning from an orange country.
In this case, too, the decision is subject to government approval, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
Tourists are against the restrictions.
The Travel Agencies Association, the Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotel Association filed a petition with the High Court of Justice to cancel the restrictions on flying.
The country lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but as mentioned left eight significant countries on the Red List.
At a hearing to be held this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red states.
The one who will support the petitioners' position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razvozov, who in recent weeks has supported easing restrictions on the entry of foreign tourists to Israel, said yesterday: “ The cancellation of isolation for vaccinated returning from abroad and the return of tourism to the vaccinated are the right and just thing during this period.
I thank my colleagues in government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighs the benefit.
Vaccination is the best response to the epidemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to lead an enabling routine alongside coronavirus."

The 7MINDS company from Beit Fatal and the White City Buildings real estate company jointly purchased a plot covering about 20 dunams in the Judean Desert, where they will establish a luxurious resort with an investment of NIS 200 million in the investment of NIS 200 million. The hotel will be built on the same site as the Masada hotel, which was destroyed about a year ago, in which it was built.
The resort will only open in about three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three shared pools, a spa, chef restaurants, an entertainment complex, a gym and more.
The person who will be in charge of the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ran Shmueli from the Colorado restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one to build the menu which is expected to have a desert concept unique to the resort.
Arad Mayor Attorney Nissan Ben Hamo welcomed the project: “ The decision to build a new and prestigious hotel near Arad gives the official stamp of Arad's amazing rise in tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the entrepreneurs' choice and convinced that it will be a joint success since Arad has huge tourism potential."
El Al presents: Flights to all of Europe starting at 78 dollars.
The sky opens up and airlines are flying on deals they haven't seen in a long time•
Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Budapest, Berlin, Amsterdam and other destinations for less than $100 for round-trip flights.

Israel's largest airline reports an increase in demand for flights abroad since yesterday's announcement of significant easing of travel.
The company decided to publish a special deal this morning on the occasion of the opening of the skies and the prices it offers are considered particularly attractive.
As part of the new operation, the company offers flights to Berlin, Budapest, Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Athens, Amsterdam, Lisbon and other destinations at prices starting from about $60 for round-trip flights.
Following the easing of flights, El Al is returning flights to a number of destinations, including Canada, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Belgium and other countries.
It is important to remember that this is a limited number of tickets ( about 4, 000) and the price does not include baggage and seat selection.
The offer is valid for bookings made today and tomorrow and for flights departing until January 31, 2022 until January 31, 2022.
As of midnight tonight, France, Spain, Portugal and other countries will be removed from the list of red countries.
The United States, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and five other countries are still on the list of red countries and there is a ban on flying to them without the approval of the Exceptions Committee.
Almost every person these days has an “ old” tablet or smartphone lying in a useless closet.
Only because a slightly newer and more sophisticated model has come out, any device can be instead of a Spotify player in the Hotspot connection.
Old devices can be road cameras, remote controls for operating devices at home and many other uses.
You don't have to be victims of consumer culture, and you don't always have to be at the forefront of technology, with another truly useless iPad, another truly useless one.
Data collection without analysis.
It’ s a shame.
It was more interesting to hear how many people received allowances from Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches ( located in the requested city centers) is worth, and how much the wages of the workers ( minimum) are worth
Israel Post must not be privatised.
The question is how many packages arrived and how many were distributed.
Because some of them have disappeared.
Packages are ordered, and they disappear at the sorting center in Modiin.
There should be a NIS 5 package tax so that they don't just order nonsense for NIS and load the mail.
This is mainly indicative of the cost of living in the country.
Thanks to King Pakim for making it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to approach the mail and hope that no letters will come from them and the hatred of mail has led us to give up anything belonging to the possibility of mail.
Have a good week.
Lay off all postal workers, and start rebuilding the post office  by a private company.
Employers are arrogant and some are racist.
On the phone, they talk differently, and when they arrive at the interview, their true face is revealed.
No wonder you can't find employees.
They are looking for slaves.
Slave jobs.
Everyone is invited to get to know true Jewry.
Well done, good on you guys.
Blessed are you who have won.
Those who stand trials and find holiness will only see light all their lives.
Just lovely.
What nonsense is it.
No Tunisian has had to hide his Jewish identity.
Historically this is wrong, it is wrong.
Ugly hairy monkey taken down from an ahwah tree.
Waste from its price tag.
Very nice article dear brother, dear brother.
Kobe I wish many were like you.
Love you.
My dear brother🔥💪❤️
There are no people like you 😍
A king.
This is a man who sees what an amazing country we have.
Problems will always be there.
That's life.
Great Kobe.
An appreciative figure
You will succeed in everything you do.
Well done that you are on the road to the king♥
There is nothing like keeping Shabbat.
More than we keep Shabbat, Shabbat protects us.
Write on Google: Shabbat observance or Shabbat laws.
And learn how to keep Shabbat, good luck to everyone♥
An amazing and very humble man.
Wishing him all the success in the world and to continue to be as magical as he is and talented at levels.
Shapo- the great Kobi Shimoni- also known as a subliminal.
Good for you - in all seriousness at the height.
It's surprising that she's still getting job offers, in her profession it's not obvious that it's not obvious.
There's nothing like going the King's♥ way.
Amazing♥ family.
A few years ago I had a dream to give Esti Zakheim the cow on her red Boras head.
Beautiful and talented.
How did you win Shomer Shabbat?
A man full of his wife and children.
Insanely talented.
Looking forward to her performances.
Perfection :-))
You are a world champion
Amazingly talented Inbal, good luck.
It's shocking that you are.   :-)
Congratulations.
Well done, good on you guys.
Love won.
Congratulations.
Not to worry is not for long.
At the moment it is of no use.
How do you know it's true love?
They returned to each other after 20 years of dating.
And she's older than him.
And he's a rich and famous hunk.
And in a few months he reported a separation of forces.
Some women can wake up every morning with a new husband.
It's a pity he didn't participate in Eurovision.
Let's hope that maybe next year he will participate in an original song of his.
That's where the big break will come in.
Instead of the egoist rising from the writer they brought and only shame did.
Where does this Timoni Greenberg come from? Hahahaha!
Who is that person?
Why does it appear on a news site?
This is not Guy Pines or the Zion of Nonsense Moses.
Smells like a well-oiled PR undercover article on the shekel yard hidden behind the name of the newspaper editorial board.
The joke is at the expense of us readers, the captive audience that escapes the clutches of the poisonous Moses and is looking for an alternative.
The song is not to my taste and neither is the video casual.
Adorable Adorable Adorable Adorable
How much talent there is.
They want more and more from him.
Tamir Greenberg is a great singer at the level of an international star.
The State of Israel is small on him.
He will break out abroad in a big way.
Clinical optometrist.
Come on, her "title" doesn't apply in the country of origin.
Who is the next sector in line?
Bibists.
And corneal mapping the main thing was not mentioned.
Alec is a clinical optometrist.
Clinical on its own behalf.
Where there will be sirens?
War at the doorstep is preparing us.
And what will the shells do? What cruelty.
Bennett Lapid and Gantz hosted by Biden: Get ready, friends get ready, get ready, get ready!
Because they are the champions of championship.
Hahaha but don't worry, even when managers are screwed up and stupid, we have abilities above and beyond expected.
Right, and besides, our dimensions, like most, are screwed up.
The Home Front Command plays "as if" games, because while an artist- we don't know, we'll not know.
Why only in Tel Aviv?
Everyone else chose the right-wing ones.
Despite the nice talk - we did not hear about the arrest of hackers, you brought them to justice with them.
And in the last four elections, the election committee was prepared for an attack.
Why not elaborate for example?
Several attempts at infiltration and disruption have been made and several have managed to penetrate into the Election Commission in the last 3 years.
We do not deserve some data, facts and proportion.
One of Hapoel Jerusalem's most bizarre signings.
Good luck Oz.
You will always be part of Maccabi's dynasty.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
All of you black seers, just allegations and answers, classic armchair yams, classic armchair yams.
Baldwin is a social attack in the locker room, according to players who played with him in both Greece and Spain.
Hollins was injured and did not play in the last games of the Red Star.
Hilliard was also injured and did not play for the last six months.
High stakes are strong.
Maccabi lacks a star.
What is it really about with Brown?
If he doesn't sign, Maccabi could be in trouble.
What about Lorenzo Brown?
Hahahaha how fits like a glove next to a loser for a group of people.
A great man, the player, the coach must give him more minutes, do not give up on him, Hapoel needs a big squad, must not give up on him.
No.
Bring in Andrian Banks.
We need more powerful Israelis on the roster.
The kind that actually plays the game.
Much more suitable than Wilbekin for Maccabi being built.
You can see that there are professionals at Maccabi Blatt and Ketch.
Perhaps personal abilities are still comparable to Scotty, but a team player, and especially game intelligence are much higher.
So sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis warm the bench.
By the way Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners and therefore will not succeed with all the stars scraped from around the world.
Who cares?
If you're already watching a game where 6 American and 3 Israeli players are for decoration, it's not better to watch a Golden State game.
Puzzle until it connects, the league will be over.
Good luck to you guys.
Good column.
I loved it.
As for the Israelis, he is absolutely right.
And a comment about Ziv- we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he can't be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he lost confidence ( which is no wonder after the treatment he received after 2 bad games in the Euroleague, as if foreigners didn't have such games) and his use may also be incorrect, and he is the result of the fixations and templates of the coach. and the result of the fixations and templates of the coach.
Blazer is not a shooter with all due respect...
Yiftach Ziv doesn't have to be in Maccabi Tel Aviv, he's destroying it too.
There used to be no good game, but Sorkin and Blazer Dudi and Cohen today, well done, well done today.
Ido Eshed, a bum Holon fan, who was given 500 NIS, so he writes nonsense.
Not Federman in the picture.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jack Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor in Europe playing about twenty minutes and are unable to score a basket, who needs foreigners at nothing and nothing, it is much better that the Israelis play.
It's good to have a good spirit for everyone, player coach and management in the momentum pull.
It depends on increasing internal fencing.
and disciplinary and required reinforcement of the coordinator and guard.
And that's the management part.
Not true.
The unmediated human interaction is important from many aspects, many of which are important.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is also a bad thing from the professional aspect and the truth, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the camera at zoom and the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom and therefore their creativity was not enough for this solution.
How do you know what will happen in another 30 years?
Someone here missed an important detail.
Scientists are not interested in warming nor rainwater.
They are only interested in the rate of population growth.
They are working on more and more vaccines and bastardized methods to destroy the world's population, so they tell us Foggy stories about warming and other nonsense they invent.
There is no problem with desalination of water, in unlimited quantities, without restriction.
They said that 50 years ago.
In the meantime, there are more people.
The solution is birth control, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's Benonians, the rest of the leftists are against their countries, and in all religions that believe in gods  among the stupid, the ignorant, the kassalim, the blind, or in short  among the herds, the stupid, the ignorant, the stupid, the blind, or in short, the herds.
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living organisms ( also sesmolans) consume oxygen and emit carbon report.
The solution: Ssmolens, kill yourself.
It's green, that's it.
Good for the world.
May it be better for you, and for sure the earth and for all of us, I say!
Who are the scientists and how they carried out the research?
I don't believe every study that talks about climate warming because that doesn't exist.
He tends to control us, to rob us of our freedom and freedom.
It's all part of the New World Order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side as he did during the coronavirus.
I have never heard him present facts from both sides, he always brings the side that serves the globalists.
We're being bullied.
Just burning money on academic “ engraving” studies.
As usual, another carving from the land of psychopathic smolens.
Things are actually getting better. Human knowledge expands and with it new technologies and improvements.
For centuries now, the world's population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, have embarked on a huge war project in the Gobi desert, with amazing success, with amazing success.
The Saudis do the same and are successful as well ( with Israeli knowledge, by the way) .
It is precisely the stupid "climate crisis" of the Sesmolans ( carbon dioxide emissions, needed for plants) that is causing the Sahara to become greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the Sesmolans' agenda, so you won't read about it in the Sesmolans' newspapers.
The leftists don't worry.
In them, the urine goes straight to the head and so they do not dry out.
Does proper management of water reservoirs mean cutting at least 70% of the world's population?
It is surprising that COVID comes and it is surprising that the majority of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose implications for the range of 5-25 years on the injected are not known at all.
It's also surprising that Agenda 2030 is being launched and now it is this.
Really puzzling the whole story.
Hahahaha what bullshit is.
Tales of a thousand and one nights, all intimidation and of course nonsense of the left trying to control the world through control of the media, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years. For two years, they have enough rainfall for two years.
They said that it didn't rain anymore in Israel either, and the drought is constant, and here it rains.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena and Peres did not know that children of Yemen were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan of course did not rob antiquities and Ezer Weizmann did not deal with his soldiers.
It is clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030
Disgusting bullshit.
They will also take care of reception in the axes, treatment of power outages and voltage drops and we are on the wave and we are on the wave.
"This is true Zionism" as the opening of the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
In the wake of the scoundrel Bennett, the rest of the licking politicians will draw a line in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I don't go near El Al, rather “ shoe on” than that.
It was very pleasant peace and no goodbye.
You won't see us in your dreams either.
One more big shame, we in Israel are being held captive by El Al. All direct flights are in her hands Price pigs Better go bankrupt already, it's time for really open skies to be really open. 4 isn't that amazing!
Some focus on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows Al-Al to fly over its territory, then it won't add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big Game Changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, acquisition of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE, tourism allowing Israeli infrastructure companies to work in Saudi Arabia, and allowing Israeli infrastructure companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
That's a lot more interesting than 30 planes a week that would save an hour each.
It is more important that they let their air force squadrons deploy in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran, and that they organize the Emirates of Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Morocco to drop weapons on Iran non-stop for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another air force squadron to position itself in northern Saudi Arabia and strike the Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from the east from a less crowded area.
After we are done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait Djibouti and the Comoros Islands into a peace agreement with Israel and get a majority of the Arab League countries that joined the peace.
After regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdogan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia overthrow the government in Qatar and finally eliminate this country's subversion, and its support for other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these common interests are over, it will be possible to talk about a few more EL AL flights if at all EL AL survives until then.
El Al needs to close down.
Tickets are sold for flights that do not take place.
The worst is that there is no way to get a representative.
"There is no customer service"
Anyone who buys a ticket at El Al and wants to change or cancel should forget about it, a sure loss, certain loss.
You have been warned, you see.
Air Canada is better off.
In any case, they prefer to fly in foreign countries.
Arkka has gone from girlfriend shit to girlfriend hell.
El Al also dropped in level.
The best thing is to order a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you claimed by train to the field.
A 40- Euro suitcase in Brinair is much cheaper than a Waze.
A backpack weighing 8 kg can be carried on.
Why are you misleading?
Wizz Air on cargo and seating take much more significantly.
One big quibble.
Just for example, I just got back if I had to Ahaiad.
The permissible weight is 30 kg.
And a 7 kg trolley.
And each extra 1 kg is $30 for each extra.
Go keep up to date.
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices, but in the end it is a bag the size of a school bag.
A trolley already costs money and a suitcase costs very, very expensive.
Lucky that the companies don't ask us to come to the flight with underwear and a tank top so that there won't be weight on the plane.
At El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% cost when booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, by a successful method.
A country eats its inhabitants and eats them.
To this must be added genetic stinginess.
It is also a shame for our country, which allows foreign airlines to exploit Israelis.
There is no government and everyone here does as he pleases.
So what did you learn today that it's not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket?
Prepare a surprise for all of us.
You will pay extras for the wheels of the plane, for the windows, for the luggage that does not arrive, for the food, for the drinks, and surely they will add to the toilets.
In short, leave at home and prices will go down.
Or big you will go out in ships.
The journey will take a few days.
You'll throw up, and then you'll probably arrive too.
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and hurt Israel, while still winning the challenge and support of his new fans.
Open now.
It's no accident that that's not the case.
It is precisely when the mess begins that there is an exemption, it is simply delusional what is happening here.
This is not the peak of the pandemic.
Simon, it doesn't suit you.
The number of confirmed cases does not mean that the number of patients is rising.
Stop being tested for any nonsense, sit at home if you don't feel well.
The story is over, it’ s over.
A government of fools.
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
And mostly stupidity.
and public confusion score 0
Only more harm than traction.
I suggest you open a new corner: “ The daily and cumulative number of deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The face and the pictures behind the default"
Your ratings will soar.
You do not understand the Minister of Finance for not paying compensation to tourism workers.
They bring another infection.
They don't care about the people.
8500 have died so far.
Something is talking about it.
They buried us, especially the elderly, in particular.
We have become Russia/North Korea.
If you don't talk about it, it doesn't exist.
The main thing is that citizens put money into the state coffers to raise for ministers the ruck and buttocks.
It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the prime minister.
Very well, the suspension of Omicron was relevant for the first week, now- there's no reason to isolate half the people, and there's no point in trying to stop Omicron- which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, they are statistically less dangerous than someone who is already here.
This is the first time I have seen sensible steps taken by the Israeli government in combating coronavirus.
As if someone actually sat and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi, did what he thought would look better in the newspaper ( and failed on all counts) .
Government at its best:
A finance minister telling the road guides to find a new profession two weeks ago, is fluent in opening the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education from Kishasha looks down on the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and sets her own policy, which puts all schools in complete chaos.
Foreign Minister, a clown who comes sick with Corona to a government meeting
And the most clownish prime minister we've ever had in the country, doesn't control the situation and loses his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government without leadership, without direction, in which all the people of Israel have lost confidence, has lost confidence.
Go home and be nice one hour earlier.
In my opinion, maybe it comes from a bad place but from a place of loss of control.
Now the prices of apartments there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Well, where are all the forecasters?!
They build a bus station and believe that it will affect all the houses.
By the way, except for sponsorship fees after me.
Let them discover Arad's exorbitant property taxes The hotel will return to being a white elephant like its predecessor.
Looks amazing.
Lots of success.
I feel like absolute dog water.
What about the art of being photographed completely naked?
Gives up the garbage.
A serious fight for Breer Field.
Why don't they give benefits to girls in the occupied Galilee by the Muslim Brotherhood?
Everyone is a joker.
In the current reality, the south is still ours.
You need a passport.
Another luxury hotel.
Surely the Knesset members will also be there.
What about a folk hotel for a folk person?
Good for investments in the [blooming] south.
Arad is developing and prospering, and well done to the mayor who, since the beginning of his term, has had an explosion for the good and glory of the city of Arad since the beginning of his term.
Cultural life, society, education and more on the height.
Just an excellent mayor who improved the city.
Well done, good on you guys.
I wonder how much protection fees the resort owner will pay the Bedouin.
Prepare money for sponsorship fees.
Wow, sounds good.
Those who can only afford El Al - a company with service and security, the best in the world in the best.
When it would be possible to fly to Dubai, you know something.
EL AL Tin Company.
Neither sociable nor economic.
In recent weeks, she canceled return flights from abroad, you see, sent messages to Israelis and told them that the flight was canceled, ruined the entire trip on the spot, informed passengers to leave a message on W. App and O in Messenger and we'll be back, come back after a day or even three.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, it's better to ground planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to Israel, and also prevent economic damage.
There are other suckers flying to Elel.
Also for free did not fly with them.
Have already returned the millions of customers they took captive for.
EasyJet to Geneva round trip 70 euros.
One way EL AL $560.
From the religious cheater who controls the company together with his screwed up son I don't buy even for $10, non-stop cheaters non-stop.
Then the company will cancel flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be in addition to the price change.
Those who buy tickets at Elel put their money on the wing of the plane.
Tin Company.
Low-cost company exercises.
No luggage, no seat selection, certainly no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights.
For all members of the "Goelicia"   I should
Nature dilutes fools.
