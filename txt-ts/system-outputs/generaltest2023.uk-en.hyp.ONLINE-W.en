Criteria for admission of children to preschool education do Kindergarten, Prague 8, U School Garden 8 - for the school year 2022/2023
Decisive for admission to preschool education is the applicant's place of actual residence, in the case of foreigners - the place of residence in the relevant school district of the Ministry of Health, at the time of applying for preschool education at the Kindergarten, Prague 8, at School Garden 8.
Another criterion evaluated is the age of the child.
Children are admitted in stages according to the criteria below until the kindergarten capacity is filled.
And if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
-Letter from the occupation.
Kherson.
"Natasha, we are holding on with all our might.
You can feel that they are afraid.
They are very afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat several times that they are great, that they are strong, and that we want to live with them.
We look down and repeat, and our minds are spinning - how scared are you s@#ts, if you need someone to repeat this greatness for you to be great?
How unsure of yourself you are.
It's like having sexual intercourse with an impotent man who needs to be told endlessly that he is strong, that he can do everything, to try very hard for him for a very long time and at the same time to think when this painful abuse will finally end.
We repeat this to keep us all safe.
Because it is very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless body with an assault rifle.
Because later, when this evil is driven out of our land, we will have to organize the city.
No matter who we talk to now, everyone has the same words.
They said that the city smelled rotten.
We'll probably need a lot of detergents to wash sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time, because everything these non-humans touched has a rotten smell.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were big.
Three healthy men stripped her naked and left her in the street, forbidding anyone to approach her to help her.
For three hours she stood naked in the street and only spoke loudly:
"Don't come near me, my dear ones.
Do not put yourself in danger.
You are welcome!
We will have a lot more business with you...
Later!
And one more thing.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It's even hard for me to imagine that they don't steal.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
From children's toys to a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because they are constantly posting leaflets in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the Armed Forces.
And when they are close, the people of Kherson will deal with evil with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they are in a hurry.
And we will wait.
Let's wait.
Let's grit our teeth, clench our fists until our fingers are numb, and wait.
Because we have something to look forward to.
To be done once and for all.
And not a single one of these evil spirits remained.
And then we will clean the city.
For a long time.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
For obvious reasons, the author of the article is not indicated.
i need to communicate. i've become very sour. i know that few people want to communicate with sour people, but i still have hope.
How satisfied are you with your housing?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same field as before you left Ukraine?
The Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs is now addressing these and similar issues in its research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The findings will help us better understand their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
Data is collected through an online questionnaire.
Everyone who provided a functional e-mail address when requesting humanitarian aid is sent an invitation to the study (from –∑–∞–ø—Ä–æ—à–µ–Ω–Ω—è@click4survey.cz).
The questionnaire is filled in only once!
By filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
PRODUCTION TECHNICIAN
MECHANIC IN PRODUCTION
We manufacture electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics, or modern medicines - none of this would have happened without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues to join our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology, and want a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities for both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I would like to say a few words about this.
There is a great desire to get together with the residents to discuss important, exciting issues, but the meeting is prohibited by law because the country is at war.
I would be grateful for your advice and any help in my efforts to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are strong.
Together, we will overcome all challenges.
Together we will win.
So please contact us.
I will listen to everyone.
I will be extremely happy and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the terms of humanitarian aid payments to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all incoming Ukrainian refugees are entitled to the first aid payment of 5000 CZK without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
In order to receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his or her financial hardship, i.e., being unemployed, not having any property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice in the following way:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The first payment of assistance will no longer be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily multiple meals and hygiene supplies, he or she will not be eligible for the 5000 kroons payment.
The authorities will assume that the basic assistance was provided in kind (housing, food, and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of the humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and there is no need to pay money.
This event is intended to solve the problem of Gypsy refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for financial assistance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ only those refugees who can prove their immediate need (lack of work, etc.) will be eligible for the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth allowances.
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå As in the first point, only those Ukrainians who have not been provided with free housing, daily meals and hygiene supplies will be able to receive financial assistance;
üìå the applicant must actually reside in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of "tourism for aid," when a refugee lives in one country and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days solely for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs of a change of residence within three business days after moving.
If the address in the application form does not match the address in the Ministry of the Interior database, the applicant will be asked to provide proof that she actually resides in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the benefit will be denied.
So far, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion CZK on humanitarian aid.
Today I spent the whole day digging in the defenses, and the whole city is digging in, so the forecasts for the near future are not very bright.
To be honest, I'm tired, it's very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, and for this, someone needs to organize equipment and people, and I am the village headman, so this is my responsibility
All utility companies are involved, and we are also turning to farmers who have excavators and tractors.
We need to unite, otherwise we will not defeat the Katsaps
There is a lot of propaganda to make people lose faith and weaken the resistance
To be honest, I haven't picked up a shovel today, but I hope I won't have to
My children put girl's stickers on my phone case so that I wouldn't forget that I am female
What will happen if the bill is passed?
‚òòÔ∏è A government commission will be formed with representatives of the President's Office, some ministries and business associations to review the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
‚òòÔ∏è The Commission and other executive authorities will review all business permits in most areas by the end of the year.
They will suggest which of the permits or procedures should be removed.
‚òòÔ∏è The Cabinet of Ministers will expedite all "unnecessary" permits and procedures.
Without any public discussion, behind the scenes!
‚òòÔ∏è It will not matter if the Cabinet's decisions contradict current laws.
The public and MPs will lose the ability to influence the regulation of economic activities that may harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
‚òòÔ∏è The state will regulate business on the principle of "one new permit minus two old ones".
Regardless of whether it makes any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
‚òòÔ∏è Behind the scenes, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents on environmental permits or procedures.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc. will be under threat!
‚òòÔ∏è Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We won't even know how and who changes the bylaws until the final decisions are made.
‚òòÔ∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the ability to influence are business associations.
Draft law No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
The short timeframe for reviewing permits, the non-transparent procedure, and the absence of any decision-making criteria are a move eastward, not toward the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the appeal.
They told her, "Grandma, the Russians have come to the village; grab your cat and get into the bead.
She refused, saying, "I'm an old mare... Save the children and girls, I'll kill myself here... The old woman goes down to the cellar, puts cucumbers in, rolls away a barrel of junk, a bunch of troughs; There are iron bars and silver locks on the door.
And someone is rattling chains outside the door.
"I didn't think I would live to see it," says the old woman.
Seventy-plus years later, and they're still going strong.
Go, but not through the cities, or I'll curse you, You'll bring us closer to Putin's kaput.
A woman's cat hisses, and glass cracks in the windows.
Tanks rumble and move between houses.
Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Hello, you need to go to the post office and confirm your identity through a "check-in", then upon confirmation you will be given a code, and this code must be entered again during the online registration and you are ready.
The bank card must be registered for the person who wants to receive the financial assistance; another card is not suitable.
I did this to a friend who was also told that she needed a key, but when she stood up to it, she waited in the government and was told why she came since she was already registered.
She was also shown in this application that she needed a key, but in fact she was already registering without it
Help me too, I applied online on May 5, but I can't figure out whether to go to the labor office or wait
it says that you will receive money on the card after processing your application, but it says that the identity is not confirmed, the banking system gives an error
Good afternoon, dear Ms. Angelina!
I would like to express my point of view on the use of "in" / "on" in relation to the word "Ukraine".
The use of this term has become a serious political issue in recent decades.
Russia's current war against Ukraine has been prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy
Thank you for the interesting exercises and tasks, for the clear explanation of grammar, and for the pleasant communication.
We are especially grateful for the technical support of the training, first of all, for the textbook, which allowed us to understand what we sometimes did not learn in the lecture.
These three months laid the foundation for our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish the entire creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions, he popularizes world classics in Ukrainian, including Lolita (V. Nabokov), The Perfumer (P. Suskind), Sin (M. Kotsiubynskyi), Letter to a Stranger and The Wild One (S. Zweig), etc.
The works he performs are not easy to perceive, requiring an investment of heart and soul.
The author deliberately leads the audience to deep emotions and tears.
In his opinion, tears are purification, the path to recovery for a modern person.
He has received a number of awards.
In 2005, he was awarded the title of People's Artist of Ukraine and the Taras Shevchenko National Prize of Ukraine (2007), but most of all, Mr. Mykhailo appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate.
The admirers of Mr. Mykhailo's talent hope that after the war is over they will hear him play the saxophone again, see his unsurpassed ability to transform, and be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art
Mineral resources of Ukraine
By origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
Therefore, their location is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
The fuel minerals extracted in our country include coal and lignite, oil, natural gas, peat, and oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully meets its own needs for hard and lignite coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we have a rational economy, we will face acute shortages of anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissya.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, agriculture, and at glass, porcelain, and food processing plants.
Peat is also used to produce various chemicals, including acetone, phenols, paraffin, feedstuffs, and yeast.
There are large deposits of oil shale in Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions.
The geography of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
The fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, so they are included in the covers of old and young platforms, as well as in marginal foothill troughs.
Coal.
94.3% of Ukraine's coal deposits are hard coal.
Ukrainian hard coal is of high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
Ukraine has deposits of the best type of coal, anthracite, with a carbon content of 94-97%.
1/3 of the coal is coking coal.
After special treatment, it is used in the smelting of iron and steel.
Ukraine ranks eighth in the world and first in Europe in terms of proven hard coal reserves, and XI and III in terms of production, respectively.
Ukraine's proven coal reserves are about 50 billion tons.
Forecast reserves are about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write "messages" on the shells they drop on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
For example, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the Eurovision stage to save the military blockaded at Azovstal in Mariupol, and the next day the Russians wrote on the shells "Kalush, as you asked! #to Azovstal".
The missiles used by the Russian military to fire at the Kramatorsk train station on April 8, 2022, had the words "For Children" on them.
Then 61 people were killed by shells with cynical inscriptions, including 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared in the First World War.
In World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies.
At the time, it helped soldiers maintain their morale while defending their homeland.
Today, the inscriptions left on the shells by the Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these shells, they are killing civilians and destroying peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they don't like the political course of Ukraine.
Russia must be stopped so that similar "messages" do not arrive in any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© border crossing greeted us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
"We are transporting insulin, it needs a temperature regime - it cannot be heated.
Is it possible to pass the control in an accelerated mode?"
The border guard allowed us to stand at the front of the line, even the trucks gave way.
Lviv
The city of Lion is alive.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body - an endless flow of people.
People from all regions of the country have found refuge and a sense of security here.
Some go on to Europe, some return home, some stay.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the windows of cathedrals, which are boarded up with dictation.
She covers monuments and sculptures with white cloths.
But you can't hear the war on Rynok Square, where thousands of voices are heard simultaneously, you can't hear it in coffee shops and bars, where people continue to live.
Yes, life stops earlier - at 11 p.m., life hides from the curfew.
But it is there: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 p.m. and announced the alarm, we could only hear it from the alert on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living their lives.
Bucha, Irpin
We made our way to Kyiv through two of the many martyr cities, Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities where the air smells of hope.
Despite the pain, people come back and rebuild their lives.
A private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Shell fragments or machine gun fire?..)
A Ukrainian flag is stretched out on the smashed balcony.
There are holes near the front door, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And there are three people rummaging around the front door.
They clean, repair, and build a wall and a new life with it.
A mother and her child are walking in the park two blocks down.
I can't help but ask myself: "Did their father survive the shooting of men in Bucha?
Will he walk with them again?"
On the way out of Irpin, there is a car cemetery.
These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and were ruthlessly shot by the Russian occupiers.
This cemetery has already become an object of a kind of "patriotic tourism."
If you go deeper and stand surrounded by autoskeletons, you can smell a heavy odor.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow-moving air, as if it could be cut with a knife.
And it's been weeks since the passengers died...
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.
In one of the cars, there was an abandoned bicycle, and in the other, a warm baby's overalls.
Somewhere there is a booklet with instructions for using the airbag.
Remnants of someone's everyday stories and lives.
As we continue driving, I look back at the city one last time and catch sight of the very bridge under which the frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, and here, on these broken slabs, a Ukrainian soldier was carrying a child in white.
This child in the white overalls probably survived.
But is there a chance that the child who wore the clothes left in one of the cars is still alive?
A man sits on a broken bridge with a camera over his shoulder.
He just sits and looks at the gap between Kyiv and Bucha.
He doesn't take pictures, he just looks.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge and wonders what it's like.
"Happy holiday!" a man shouts out to us joyfully, "Happy City Day!"
On May 29, wartime Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Mykolaiv
A hero city, an outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A frontline city that the occupiers still cannot capture.
And we believe that they will not capture it - the city is fighting and living.
On street corners, at every other intersection, there are neatly stacked tires and Banderite stripes.
Mykolaiv in the evening is incredibly quiet now - the noise of the city has subsided.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And at night it is extremely dark.
Light masking for safety.
People live by candlelight, or rather, by the flashlights of their cell phones.
At home, we turn on the lights only in the kitchen - quickly and when needed.
My grandmother curtained the windows with heavy blankets, so that no light could get through.
There is a hunting rifle next to my sister's childhood bed.
"I've had it on hand since the 24th," says the father.
When air raid alarms and explosions sound, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time anymore.
Even in a frontline city, it is very difficult to live in a mode of constant anxiety.
When to live then?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers away from the town, shots from "peons" reach the Zhovtnevyi district and cover Kulbakyne.
Several times it flies close to my family.
To the next block, across the street from us.
To my grandmother's neighbors - her windows were blown out, and the children took them to their place, to a safer neighborhood.
And we are on the border of Ingul and Central districts.
Life goes on.
A siren wails on the central Soborna Street, and an elderly couple sits on a bench, chatting about something, discussing it quietly.
A cyclist passes by.
We look at each other with my dad - what are we going to do?
"Well... Shall we go for coffee?"
We are still sitting on Soborna Street (formerly Sovetska, by the way) in the park near the monument to St. Nicholas.
What else is there to do?
To be honest, when a siren catches you by surprise on the street, there is often nowhere to hide, no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
It's not just a hole in the building, it's a hole in the heart of every Mykolaiv resident.
On the lawn near the entrance is a huge trident - it used to decorate the RSA.
Today, where the trident used to stand, there is an empty "nothing".
Just as it was at the site of the RSA head's office and a dozen offices around it.
The missile landed squarely on Kim's desk.
The war takes on a completely different shape when it is not in the news, but under our feet.
I walk through the corridors of the RSA, and with every step I hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor - someone had filed requests and applications, but it doesn't matter now.
On the desk of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag.
There is a flower on the nightstand.
We took her home, transplanted her, and let her live.
We met the guard who was on duty on March 29.
He survived.
"We've darned it, sewn it up," he points to his head.
Only journalists can get to the RSA.
We are joined by a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, live broadcasts, interviews.
According to official figures, 36 people were killed.
This is "September 11 in Mykolaiv," a "monument to the Russian world," the press attach√© of the regional head comments.
Mykolaiv Regional State Administration is just one of the wounds on the body of Mykolaiv.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even when Denmark helps rebuild the regional state administration, Mykolaiv residents will always see it as a terrible emptiness.
Russia has started a new "gas war".
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, Russia has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transportation system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped supplying gas to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May - to Finland.
In June, Russia significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream pipeline.
Official Berlin expects Russia to cut off natural gas supplies through this route as early as July.
Russia also used such blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
For Russia, gas has always been not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West is paramount.
Financing the Russian economy is like donations for World War III.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to quickly diversify their gas and oil supplies.
But it will take time for the EU to become energy independent from Russian energy.
Meanwhile, Putin's regime is scaring Europe with an imminent energy crisis and lack of heating in homes.
European countries, especially those dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may experience a shortage.
However, this crisis will stimulate a more frugal attitude to natural resources and energy efficiency.
Europe will benefit when it gives up Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
Temporary discomfort is worth enduring so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia burns crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army is using incendiary shells to destroy ripe crops of grain and oilseeds.
By doing so, Russia is causing the spread of hunger in the world.
Due to the Russian war, the number of people in the world suffering from food shortages could increase by more than 40 million.
At the same time as destroying Ukrainian crops, Russians are stealing grain that has already been harvested from Ukrainian elevators, destroying agricultural infrastructure, and blocking sea exports.
The destruction of Ukraine's agricultural potential is another manifestation of Russia's military aggression.
In this way, Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the global economy.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital Transformation is launching an innovative hotline format - the virtual center Diia.Biznes.
Forced migrants from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for formalizing their stay, registering a business, finding employment and receiving assistance.
Therefore, the Diia.Business virtual center is being launched to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format until Ukrainians can return home.
It's scary how you have to be afraid of every important day, and how you never know what might come.
Good afternoon, Anna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician back and ask when the next time we can come for Darusya's vaccination.
It was supposed to be tomorrow, but I can't come because I need to replace the battery in the car, it will be here by the end of the week.
A neighbor brought a cable and we charged it from Marina's car.
But the car's dashboard says the battery needs to be replaced.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia is supposed to bring it from Ukraine, and here it will be replaced
Tomorrow I'll try to start the car, and if it works, we'll go alone, I'll leave my grandmother in the car and keep the engine running.
If I don't, I'll write to you and you'll come to get us
I'm not comfortable disturbing you, distracting you from your work.
Okay, we'll go with you at 11:45 to avoid any risks.
"The war is not over yet, and the fate of our new neighbors is also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of fleeing to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure journey they are taking together to get them into hastily loaded cars.
The stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all the adults who still don't quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
The stories of children whose only memory of home is a toy they could cling to during the many hours spent in crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people," the organizers emphasize.
At the end of each trip, they return to a safe home.
But this trip is different, more terrible.
This trip has not ended even after more than eight months.
He is expected to return home.
The topic of war is omnipresent, so our march may seem superfluous.
On the contrary, in the face of growing antipathy and hostility in society, which are fomented and exploited by the narodniks, we want to point out that involuntary travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in poetic form and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
They are now part of it."
Despite such a painful theme, the parade was still light and encouraging.
This was done by craftsmen and craftswomen who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, motanka, houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade marched from Kampa to Wenceslas, and at each stop there was a huge performance, the dramaturgy of which was developed by Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to keep the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians are facing now," says the playwright. - "Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects normal life, which is interrupted by an air attack.
Glowing birds are the first to come to the rescue - they cover the children with their wings first of all.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of protecting wings is even more relevant.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song is spreading in a column.
And all the creatures came back to life: sunflowers, motanki, toys, and even houses.
This is symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and to every Czech who has helped and is helping Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we will be able to overcome this difficult path and safety will prevail in our homes."
His wife sends her husband to the market to buy snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, the man meets his friends and goes into a binge for three days, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers the snails, goes to the market, buys some snails, and comes home.
He thinks about telling his wife why he was gone for so long.
He rings the doorbell, pours snails on the floor, his wife opens the door, and he says, pushing them with his hands:
- Here we are!
We're coming in, coming in, coming in...
Our editorial team spoke with Ukrainian refugee Maryna, who worked in the field of architecture in her native Nikopol.
"Now I'm trying to realize myself as an artist," said the Ukrainian.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, worries about family members.
In a conversation with Maryna, a refugee from Ukraine, we can see her confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she and her children found themselves.
But she believes in herself and tries to adapt to life in Prague, not giving up the idea of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Maryna is from Nikopol in the Dnipro region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children, a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect at the State Nikopol Institution.
"By education, I am an architect of buildings and structures, I graduated from the Dnipro Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Prior to that, I studied at an art school and graduated from a lyceum with a degree in graphic design," says Maryna.
And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Maryna left Ukraine with her children without hesitation.
Prague became a refuge for the woman.
"Of course, it's a new city, big, crowded... It's a new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what Czechs say to me.
My knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
In addition, I do not hesitate to ask Czechs for help and have never felt any aggression from them.
I thank them for that," Marina said.
According to her, people who have been living in Prague for a long time helped her with issues related to finding housing, applying for visas and insurance, and applying for benefits.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the garden
After receiving a tolerated stay visa, Maryna dreamed of finding a job.
"Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands..." she said.
"We were not accepted to the kindergarten because there were no places.
They say that we need to look for adaptation groups for children, but no one knows exactly where they are.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She tried to help me find a place in a kindergarten for my children by calling a number of different authorities, but..." Maryna continues.
"In general, I am very concerned about the state of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become moody and disobedient.
I can't say that my children interfere with me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to attend Czech language courses without any problems.
One day I went to a Czech class with my kids, and they played for a while and then started acting up.
Like a normal mom, I was distracted, unable to study properly... I wish there were language courses for adults with children or someone to be with the kids during the lessons... But my daughter is so attached to me," the woman sighs.
"Of course, we go to various free events with our children that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, and we are very grateful to the Czech Republic for that," Marina added.
When the children are sleeping, Maryna is engaged in self-education, learning Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
One day, Maryna was looking at job postings on the Internet and saw an announcement: "As part of the Spolek Zaedno Association's initiative with the support of the EC Delegation to the Czech Republic, 12 Stars for Ukraine, we are organizing a one-day art workshop at the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists and offer brushes and paints.
The only thing required from the participants is their creative imagination...".
Marina could not but take advantage of this opportunity.
"I plucked up the courage and applied to participate.
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we spent the whole day painting.
Before that, I didn't sleep, I was worried.
In addition, I hadn't picked up a brush in six years," said the Ukrainian.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists.
"The subject matter of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use Ukrainian themes in our works - we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.
That's why blue and yellow colors prevail in the collection of paintings," Marina added.
The event was attended by 30 applicants, of whom only 12 were selected.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings will be held in Prague with their participation, with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic.
"This is how life is.
All your knowledge and skills can be useful, and you can also support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," Maryna said.
"And now I'm trying to realize myself as an artist.
Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
But something has to be done..." the woman said.
Maryna is grateful to the Czech Republic for its hospitality and friendliness, but believes that the war will end soon and she and her children will return to Ukraine.
Active hostilities continue in the south of Ukraine.
Residents of the temporarily occupied and frontline settlements continue to move to safer areas.

War destroys everything it touches.
And it will take a long time for Ukraine to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia has started.
However, Ukrainians are not waiting for better times, and have already begun clearing their towns and villages of Russian garbage and rebuilding infrastructure.
The Kyiv region took the brunt of the attack in the first days of the full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break through to the capital and capture it in a few days.
These towns and villages survived active hostilities, atrocities of the Russian army, and in some places occupation.
In early April, the Ukrainian Armed Forces completely liberated the region from the enemy.
The photographer Oleksandr Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after the active hostilities and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are rebuilding their homes and public spaces.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly capture Ukraine, Russia launched a new stage of this war - the information war.
The Russian Federation is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce the international community's support for Ukraine.
Instead of helping the Ukrainian armed forces fight the aggressor, international organizations are assessing the actions of Ukrainian defenders and thus becoming complicit in Russia's information warfare.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report that the Ukrainian military is setting up positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure.
At the same time, it ignored the fact that it was only about the facilities from which civilians had been completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to Russian information attacks!
Remember: Russia has attacked Ukraine, seized its territories, killed and tortured civilians, and destroyed cities and villages.
Russia is guilty of war, it has no right to take any action on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and drive the enemy out of the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine stand up to Russia on all fronts!
I am sure that every person in the world has ever dreamed of their ideal home.
Believe it or not, I am no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.
It would be next to the beach and have a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I will definitely be happy to live in the heart of the picturesque landscapes.
My house would be a two-story cottage with a beautiful exotic garden in front of the house, and there would be many different flowers and fruit trees.
I will also have a garage for my car.
By car, I will be able to go to work, go shopping, or just travel with my family wherever our eyes lead us.
My ideal home would have at least six rooms: a bright and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, an office with a workstation, and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with bedside tables and chests of drawers.
The office will have a lot of interesting books in the bookcases.
The living room would become the most visited place in the house, where the whole family could get together, share news or just have fun.
That's why there would be a large sofa with small pillows, several armchairs, a chest of drawers, a huge TV, and a long built-in aquarium.
In addition, my ideal home would have an attic where we could make a home theater or entertainment room.
Behind my house there would be a swimming pool with several hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we can do exercises every day to keep fit or just play different team sports such as volleyball, basketball, soccer, etc.
My ideal home would be big and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I would love to live there.
But this is just my dream... I have to make it come true.
Hi, how many people should there be so that I know which room to prepare? Is it just one?
I handed the letters to you as a secretary
Yes, of course, that's why I ask how many of them there are so that I know where to put them
Of course, you tell me right away, so that I know
To have time to clean the room
Also, please tell me how to send a parcel to Ukraine, my daughter-in-law is due to give birth on the 6th and probably needs our help, she is now alone at this time, I can't leave her without support, she is my only granddaughter
Food, diapers.
It's just that I'm going to the hospital on June 6.
I was released from the hospital for only 10 days.
I did not have time to buy everything for the child.
There is no bedding yet, only a blanket.
I hope they will find them, but the main thing is not to panic, because now I don't know what to do, I am ready to go and search by myself, but I will not be allowed to go to Donetsk, where there are heavy battles and I don't know how it will be with the search, it is difficult
So the last words I heard from him were that I was a hard worker and it was good that I took my sisters and brothers, that they were safe
I have to hold on to my children, they are my hope and support, I have nothing but them, they are everything, I am happy to have them
My whole body is numb, I don't feel anything good at all, I can't walk, I've never had anything like this before
Yes, thank you, I can't go there today, I need to calm down and collect my thoughts, there are a lot of thoughts
"A fight in equal numbers".
How football teams from Ukraine and Russia fought in Turkey

FC Minaj claims that this is a recent photo from the last training session after the fight with the Russians
In Antalya, Turkey, a conflict broke out at a training camp between players of the Ukrainian Premier League football club Minaj and Russian Shinnik.
The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams happened to be staying.
Initially, Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict that occurred on February 13.
The fight was later confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC Minaj, the conflict was provoked by Russians.
Allegedly, one of them was drunk and harassing a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight did take place, but on the floor where the Russians were staying and in equal numbers.
"The number of victims from Shinnik only confirms the fact that the Russians are also 'abandoning' their own," the statement said.
The club claims that after the fight ended, the Russians continued to fight with each other, and local police had to intervene.
"Before the training camp started, FC Minaj's main demand to the organizers was that there were no Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to accommodate Shinnik," the statement reads.
Football journalist Roman Bebekh, who was one of the first to tweet about the situation, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player defending an employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Baza telegram channel writes that representatives of Minaya approached the players of Yaroslavl's Shinnik and demanded that they sing the Ukrainian anthem.
Ukrainians denied this.
"They had a numerical advantage on their side.
Several people attacked our guy.
Yaroslavl residents stood up for him and defended him.
There were five or six of us, there were many more Ukrainians," a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"The Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, and their injuries included a split lip, a broken toe, and suspected bruised ribs," Kommersant writes.
"I don't understand how Ukrainians could be in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine," Shinnik CEO Serhiy Kulakov said in a comment to reporters.
Later, Kulakov told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but emphasized that they were not being evicted, they had decided to leave on their own.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what does this have to do with medicines for diabetics
7 minute(s) ago
Injections that are gaining popularity can help you lose up to 15% of your weight, but have many side effects.
In the UK, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy slimming injections, which are used by some famous people, including Elon Musk.
Wegovy's main ingredient is semaglutide, which helps to control obesity in type 2 diabetes.
Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience on social media, have admitted to using it.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes can actually contribute to weight loss.
By acting on specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down food digestion.
As a result, a person feels hungry less often, gets full faster, and consumes fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick fix and not a miracle cure that helps you lose weight without any effort.
Treatment is carried out under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and exercise.
Like any medicine, Wegovy can have side effects.
The most common are nausea or indigestion, bloating, and gas.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to loss of facial fat and, in some people, to sagging cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
Doctors called this effect "Ozempic face", from the name of another diabetes drug that is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors advise taking Wegovy for no more than two years.
Ukrainian Armed Forces regain some lost ground
4 hour(s) ago
Photo by MARKO DJURICA Reuters
In some areas of the frontline, the Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to regain previously lost positions and gain a foothold.
This was stated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valeriy Zaluzhnyi during a conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhnyi, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk sector, where Russians carry out up to 50 attacks daily.
Fierce fighting continues in the area of Vuhledar and Maryinka, where Zaluzhnyi said the Ukrainian Armed Forces are holding the line.
"Despite the enemy's constant pressure, we continue to keep Bakhmut under control and are taking measures to stabilize the front line around the city," said Zaluzhnyi.
In a conversation with General Milly Zaluzhny shared his concerns about Russia's use of maritime surface drones, which threatens civilian navigation in the Black Sea.
After capturing Soledar, Russian troops continue to tighten the ring around Bakhmut.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut was "developing successfully" for his troops.
On February 11, the evening report of the General Staff stated that Russia was reinforcing its grouping of troops on the Liman and Bakhmut directions.
In the evening of February 10 and on the night of February 11, Russians attacked Ukraine's critical infrastructure in several regions.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, from 6 p.m. on Friday until midnight, Ukrainian air defense destroyed two dozen "Shaheds" launched by Russians from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov.
On February 10, Russia launched another missile attack on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

EU to strengthen sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
On the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, the European Union will impose new sanctions on Russia.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in a government statement in the Bundestag on Wednesday, February 8, on the eve of the emergency EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU would support Ukraine "as long as it takes".
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kyiv with the most financial support.
"We are also far ahead of everyone else in continental Europe in the supply of weapons and ammunition," he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized "public bidding under the motto: combat tanks, submarines, airplanes - whoever demands more."
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Scholz: NATO should not become a party to the conflict
In addition, the German Chancellor once again emphasized that despite all the assistance provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not become a party to a military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue to closely coordinate with partners to supply weapons to Kyiv.
Scholz recalled the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022 to support it on its path to European integration.
At the upcoming extraordinary summit, the EU countries intend to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine's European path, he emphasized.
Ukraine belongs to Europe, and its future lies in the European Union, the chancellor added.
An emergency EU summit will be held on February 9-10 in Brussels.
One of the main topics will be Russia's war against Ukraine.
According to Reuters, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend the EU leaders' summit.

Metzola calls for giving Kyiv fighter jets and long-range weapons - DW - 09.02.2023
During a meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke, European Parliament President Roberta Mecola called for the provision of aircraft and long-range weapons to Ukraine.
"EU member states must quickly consider, as a next step, providing the long-range systems and fighter jets you need to protect the freedom that many take for granted," Mecola said.
According to her, the response should be proportional to the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union," she said, addressing Zelenskyy.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
Zelenskyy, for his part, also noted that Ukraine is on its way to EU membership.
"We are getting closer to the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
A victorious Ukraine is a victorious member of the European Union," Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself against "the most anti-European force in the modern world."
"They are trying to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life with an all-out war.
But why?
To destroy the European way of life as such after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of all 27 elements of the European lifestyle, 27 EU countries.
We will not allow this," the President of Ukraine emphasized.
Zelensky will ask to speed up arms supplies
The day before, DW reported that Zelenskyy arrived in Brussels to get the support of the European Council and speed up the provision of critical weapons to Ukraine.
As a source from Zelenskyy's advanced diplomatic team recalled, during Zelenskyy's visit to the United States in late December last year, Kyiv received "an agreement to transfer Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support, which was voted for by Congress."
"That's why the president of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally travels to other capitals," the source said.
At the same time, the diplomat noted that "of course, such decisions are not the business of the European Council, but the decisions of the member states."
Zelenskyy is expected to voice Ukraine's arms needs during the European Council summit and to speak personally with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member states.
According to the source, Ukraine needs, first of all, long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia launches major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the US Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the western part of the region has increased markedly over the past week, according to a February 8 analysts' report.
It also noted that geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvorichne, northwest of Svatove.
Ukrainian Armed Forces do not allow Russia to achieve significant success
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three major Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces have so far prevented Russian troops from achieving significant success.
The ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full momentum, the Russian command has not yet deployed units of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was redeployed to Luhansk Oblast in January after being deployed to Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in Luhansk region currently hold the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces set the terms of engagement, ending the period of Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full engagement of these forces could lead to their final culmination at the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions," the report says.
According to analysts, this culmination is likely to create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces, which they could use to launch their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in a morning report, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that Russian troops, trying to take full control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive actions in five directions: Kupyansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka in the areas of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Maryinka and Vuhledar.

"Attempts to attack both in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, of course, will be made," he said in an interview with Reuters.
- How successful they will be will depend on us."

SpaceX limits the ability of the Armed Forces to control drones via Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
On Thursday, February 9, Mykhailo Podolyak, advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, called on the American company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kyiv in the war waged by Russia.
This is how he reacted to the information that Elon Musk's company has limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
"Companies have to decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to free life and Ukraine, and then they don't invent ways to harm; or they are on the side of Russia and its 'right' to kill and seize territories," Podoliak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink should not be a weapon
The day before, SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army is actively using to counter Russian aggression, "was never intended to be used as a weapon."
"However, Ukrainians are using it in an unforeseen way that is not part of any agreement.
We know that the military uses it for communication, and this is normal.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes," Reuters quoted the director as saying.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could "limit their ability to do that."
"There are things we can do and have already done," she added.
The company refused to specify what measures it had taken.
SpaceX "bargained" with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX donated Starlink systems to Kyiv to provide the population with Internet access.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue to finance Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over the issue.
At the time, it estimated the required funding by the end of 2022 at $120 million, and over the next 12 months at about $400 million.
The issue of securing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, as well as in the European Union, but soon after, the company's owner, Musk, said that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US defense department to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Five Ukrainians may be trapped under the rubble caused by the earthquakes in Turkey, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko said on Thursday, February 9.
"We have information about the possible presence of five Ukrainians under the rubble.

According to him, the rescuers have Starlink, drones and all the necessary equipment to work on the debris.
Together with the rescuers, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine sent 10 search and rescue dogs and 18 pieces of equipment to Turkey.
According to Klymenko, the mission will stay there for 10 days.
Number of victims of earthquakes in Turkey and Syria exceeds 17 thousand
As of the middle of the day on February 9, the number of victims of the earthquake in Turkey has increased to 14,014, and another 63,794 people were injured, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, Anadolu Agency reports.

Relations with Germany are developing in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that relations between Berlin and Kyiv are developing "in waves" amid Russian aggression, with "ups and downs."
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
"I am a fast person by nature.
Others are slower to act, which may also be due to their bureaucracy," Zelensky said, adding that in a time of war, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every second.
Revitalization of air defense
The President of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage, Germany's "conservative attitude" changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally received support from Steinmeier (German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I had previously had difficulties, especially because of the so-called Steinmeier formula," Zelensky said.
He emphasized that "good work" had been done to change the relationship.
"We have received IRIS-T air defense systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives," the President of Ukraine noted.
According to Zelenskyy, Berlin has managed to increase the production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T systems to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate over the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kyiv has brought relations with Germany "back to a difficult phase," the Ukrainian president said.
He called the discussions on this issue "emotional and difficult."
"I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that it is not us who need this help, but the Europeans," Zelensky explained.
Categorical about fighter jets
After the allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kyiv with battle tanks, discussions began about the transfer of fighter jets, which Ukraine insists on.
Scholz took a categorical position on this: Germany will not transfer combat aircraft under any circumstances.
At the same time, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv "as long as necessary."
He made such statements after his meeting with Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of European Union leaders on Thursday.

A new prime minister has already been nominated - DW - 10.02.2023
The Moldovan government, along with Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita, resigned.
The decision was made after consultations with President Maia Sandu, Havrylytsia said on Friday, February 10.
"After a year and a half in the government, it is time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, fighting corruption and integration into the European Union," she said.
According to her, during her tenure, the government "faced energy blackmail."
"They thought that we would give up and act like previous governments that betrayed national interests, but that was not the case. We worked in a continuous crisis mode," Havrylytsia emphasized.
She did not specify the reasons for her decision to resign, citing only the lack of "support and trust at home."
Sandu thanked the prime minister "for her tremendous sacrifice and efforts," also noting that Gavrila led the government during the crisis.
"Despite the unprecedented challenges, the country was governed responsibly, with great attention and dedication.
We have stability, peace and development where others wanted war and bankruptcy," the Moldovan president said.

Secretary of the Security Council may become the new prime minister
According to the law, the Cabinet of Ministers will continue to perform its duties until the new government is sworn in.
To replace Gavrilica, Sandu has already proposed her security adviser, the current secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and former Minister of the Interior, Dorin Recean.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, in which the Action and Solidarity party has a majority.
Havrylytsia was its representative, so voting for Rechan should not be a problem, AFP notes.
Recean has already stated that he plans to continue to seek Moldova's membership in the European Union.
According to him, the new government's priorities will be "order and discipline, breathing new life into the economy, and peace and stability," Reuters reports.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.
The country has twice experienced complete power outages across the country as a result of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly restricted gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to cut them off completely.
Chisinau called the reduction in supplies a political decision unrelated to payment issues.

Why are aftershocks dangerous?
Despite the fact that the sub-zero temperatures in the region are causing less and less hope for rescue, rescue efforts are ongoing.
Thus, 102 hours after the earthquake in southern Turkey, a family of six was freed from the rubble, the state news agency Anadolu reported.
A total of 166,000 Turkish and foreign rescuers, police, medics and volunteers are involved in the rescue efforts.
More than eight thousand of them are rescuers from 61 countries.
A total of 97 countries have sent aid to Turkey, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
"White Helmets" in Syria criticize the UN for lack of assistance
According to the United Nations (UN), the earthquake left about 5.4 million people homeless.

In Turkey, nearly 171,000 tents have been set up in the region affected by the aftershocks.
According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets have been delivered to the disaster site.
At the same time, in Syria, representatives of the White Helmets non-governmental organization, which is carrying out a rescue mission in rebel-controlled regions, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a representative of the White Helmets said that only two small international teams of volunteers, who do not have rescue equipment, had arrived in the region to provide assistance.
In addition, according to him, no humanitarian aid from the UN is coming to the region.
Meanwhile, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which reports on events in the rebel-controlled northern regions of Syria, noted that one shipment of UN aid arrived in the region the day before, but it lacked shelter tents and equipment to clear the rubble.
About three thousand White Helmets volunteers are involved in rescue efforts in northern Syria.
According to them, the group managed to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people have been found, and more than 3,300 people are believed to be dead.
More than 10 thousand more were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
In the early morning hours of February 6, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 occurred in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria.
This earthquake was the most powerful in almost a century of observations.
The last time Turkey experienced aftershocks of this magnitude was in 1939, when about 33,000 people died.
In less than 12 hours, a second powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook southeastern Turkey, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

Cyprus holds a decisive round of presidential elections - DW - 12.02.2023
On Sunday, February 12, the second and decisive round of the presidential election is taking place in the Republic of Cyprus.
Former Foreign Minister Nicos Christodoulidis and former Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations Andreas Mavroyianis were among the participants.
Conservative politician Christodoulidis received 32 percent of the vote in the first round, while his rival in the second round, Mavroyanis, who is supported by leftist forces, received 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling Democratic Union (DISY) party, Averof Neofita.
After the defeat of its candidate in the first round, the DISY party was unable to decide whom to support, making the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, AFP reports.
The president of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by popular vote.
He forms and heads the country's government.
The winner of the current elections will hold the post of head of state for five years and will become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of a coup supported by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the Turkish-occupied northern sector of the island proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Ankara.
The latest talks on the attempted reunification of Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots, about 560,000 people, participate in the elections.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote in them.

"Energoatom reported a new threat to ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
Petro Kotin, President of Energoatom, has called the reduction of water in the Kakhovka reservoir by the Russians a new threat to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).
"There are a lot of threats to ZNPP.
The decline in water in the Kakhovka reservoir is a new added threat," Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that as of the evening of February 11, the reservoir level was 13.8 meters, compared to the normal level of 16 meters, "so that the plant receives power for its generators, for turbine capacitors and for security systems."
"In recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and is rising slightly, because it reached 13.7 meters, 13.6 meters," Interfax-Ukraine quoted Kotin as saying.
He explained that the Russians who control the locks at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant have started to release less water, while the inflow up the Dnipro has increased.
The president of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at ZNPP is sufficiently filled and there is enough water for now, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, it will be a big problem for ZNPP, he said.
Kotin emphasized that the critical level would be 12 meters, and the emergency level would be 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, would prevent a critical situation.

The Russian and Ukrainian sides blame each other for this, and there is no independent data on who is shelling the ZNPP.
Israel to intensify campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to intensify its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, February 12.
"The government is meeting today to prepare for an even broader response to those who commit terrorism," Reuters quoted Netanyahu as saying.
This statement followed a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
The police shot the man dead at the scene, and arrested and interrogated the Palestinian's family members.
Israeli law enforcement officers welded the doors and windows in the house of a Palestinian family.
The next step after the sealing may be the demolition of the attacker's house, AR writes.
Just one day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot and killed during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired a rocket toward the Israeli border on Saturday night.
The Israeli army said the missile was intercepted, dpa reports.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army conducts almost daily raids in the West Bank, which has led to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported killed in these attacks or in their own attacks.
In addition, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman were killed in Palestinian attacks in 2023.
According to human rights activists, in 2022, about 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, making this year the deadliest in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis last year, AR reports.
Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, according to dpa.

Greek Foreign Minister visits Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
The earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece, longtime opponents, dpa reported on Sunday, February 12.
On the same day, Foreign Ministers Nikos Dendias and Mevlut Cavusoglu held an unexpected meeting, during which, as recorded by Greek television cameras, they even hugged.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
√áavu≈üoƒülu thanked Dendias for being one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the natural disaster.
He added that the two countries will try to restart a dialog and solve their problems.
"Greece's assistance to the Turkish people does not end there," the Greek Foreign Minister emphasized.
According to him, Athens will "do everything" - bilaterally and within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit the disaster area.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the Antakya and Hatay regions.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
For several days now, political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope that the assistance provided by Athens to Ankara could be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
The two NATO members have already demonstrated solidarity with each other during the major earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This assistance, known as "earthquake diplomacy," helped to achieve a certain d√©tente at the time.
The conflict over the islands
For decades, Athens and Ankara have been arguing over sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
Ankara is questioning Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesvos, Samos and Kos.
Greece seems to be violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous landing craft on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
Read also: Greece and Turkey on the verge of an armed conflict?
Turkey reinforces its claims almost daily by flying fighter jets over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, President Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Ankara's Warming with Armenia
Against the backdrop of the tragedy caused by the earthquakes, there is also a warming of Turkey's relations with Armenia.
Ankara has opened a crossing that has been closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia have been passing for the victims of the disaster.
In addition, Armenia announced the dispatch of two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the February 6 earthquake that killed more than 33,000 people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are tense due to historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
As the successor to the Ottoman Empire, Turkey recognizes that it exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide has been condemned, in particular, by the United States, Germany, and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the backdrop of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation was only getting worse.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers has begun in Brussels, including a meeting in the so-called Ramstein format on Tuesday, February 14.
The agenda of the event includes further increasing support for Ukraine in the war and increasing the production of ammunition.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting that NATO should provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war."
"We see no signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensives and new attacks," Reuters quoted him as saying.
"This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics," Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and talks about the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.

During the meeting, ministers are expected to approve long-term guidelines for the Alliance's defense planning.
"The allies will discuss investment in defense and how to protect our critical infrastructure," Interfax-Ukraine quoted Stoltenberg as saying.
What to expect from the ninth Ramstein
On the same day, the US-led Contact Group meets at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov in attendance.
The head of the Ukrainian defense ministry will also join a special session of the NATO defense ministers' meeting.
"The more than 50 countries in the Contact Group are united with you in this fight for Ukraine's sovereignty and self-defense," Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of his meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military and political leadership had previously expressed hope that at the next Ramstein meeting, the partners could decide to provide Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that following this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of tanks to be provided to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants a ban on Russian artists' tours in the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine is collecting data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations funded by the Russian state budget in order to include them in the new EU sanctions package.
This was reported by Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Halyna Hryhorenko in an interview with DW.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
According to Hryhorenko, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum says very clearly that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation," says Grigorenko.
In her opinion, dialogue through culture with Russia is impossible today.
That is why Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, and musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
For example, recently, the National Opera of Ukraine Choir and the National Philharmonic Orchestra of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a proxy of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DPR" in Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour
However, according to Hryhorenko, this is not enough, and those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin's policy still manage to tour Europe.
"To officially cancel such tours, you need to have names on the European sanctions lists," says Hryhorenko and adds: "We are working to ensure that Russian cultural figures who promote Russian narratives outside of Russia are part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts, in the EU."
According to Hryhorenko, the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, and a special working group under the Office of the President of Ukraine are dealing with this issue in Ukraine.
As reported earlier, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Brussels on February 9 that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at the Kyiv summit.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the tenth package's sanctions list.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of Russian cultural and media figures, which contains more than 300 names.

The US is ready to sell HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment to Poland for $10 billion
The U.S. State Department has approved a possible sale of military equipment and services to Poland worth about $10 billion.
This was reported by Voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin with reference to the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
These include launchers of the M142 HIMARS highly mobile artillery missile system with ammunition, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, and other military equipment.
"This acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe," the Agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen domestic defense and deter regional threats."
In general, Poland has submitted a request to purchase such equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of the HIMARS loader module;
- 45 M57 Army Tactical Air Defense Missile Systems (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of the GMLRS multiple launch rocket system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
The agreement also includes missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and equipment, system integration support, engineering and logistics services of the US government and contractors, training, sensors, and other related hardware and software elements.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is in addition to the launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw has also requested missile launchers from South Korea," the publication informs.
NATO Secretary General urges the US to be prepared for a long war of the Russian Federation in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to protect it in the war against Russia is not off the table, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
"The first step in providing advanced aircraft is to have soldiers or pilots who are capable of using them.
This is a process that takes some time.
We have started this process today," Sunak said of the previously announced program to train Ukrainian pilots in the UK.
- Nothing is off the table, and our leadership in this matter is something we should all be proud of."
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks would arrive in Ukraine "next month" and said that Ukraine "should never again be left vulnerable to attack" and called for "arming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term."
According to him, the UK has agreed to expand its training program, which has trained 10,000 soldiers over the past six months, and promised, as CNN writes, to "speed up the delivery of our equipment" to ensure that Ukraine reaches the front lines in the coming "days and weeks, not years."
During a press conference, President Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude for the support of Ukraine: "Today it is clear that we have the support of the United Kingdom.
Thank you to all the people of the UK, thank you for these 350 days of unity."
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he reiterated his call for Western fighter jets and added that he had "heard from Mr. Prime Minister about his desire to provide fighter jets" to Kyiv.
The Russian Embassy in London has already stated that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military and political consequences" for the entire world.
Today, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kyiv continues to talk to its Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: "I spoke with Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra to coordinate our international steps as Russia's full-scale invasion approaches the one-year mark.
I thanked him for the latest decision on tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We are continuing our dialog with the Netherlands and others on combat aircraft."
Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat tells CNN that Ukraine will need dozens of Western warplanes to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say the West has a short window of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before Russia's expected new offensive begins in the spring or even February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin has already been trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since early January.

"Politics and profits" stand in the way of vaccination
The Director-General of the World Health Organization said on Sunday that if countries do not effectively use existing tools to combat the pandemic, it will not be possible to end it.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it," said Tedros Adan Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the tools we need - effective healthcare facilities and effective medical instruments.
But the world has not used these tools well," Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries.
The obstacles to reaching the WHO's goal of vaccinating 40% of each country's population against coronavirus are "politics and profits," the WHO chief said, "not production."
"Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue in favor of COVAX and the African Vaccine Purchase Facility," Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaboration initiative created to ensure equitable distribution of the COVID vaccine.
Gebreyesus also emphasized that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic in isolation from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperating to protect other peoples.
Together!" - Gebreyesus said on Twitter.
The WHO official also called on vaccine manufacturers to "prioritize and honor their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust]" and become "much more transparent about what goes where."
AVAT is an African Union initiative aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to "share know-how, technology and licenses and give up intellectual property rights."
Earlier, Karen Attia, a contributor to The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share the "recipe" for the Moderna vaccine with the world.
"The US administration has been trumpeting the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donating vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, this is not good-hearted philanthropy; it is arrogance.
Poorer countries didn't ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they asked for a fair shot from the start," the observer noted.
"We are not asking for charity," Tedros said, "we are calling for smart investments in global recovery.
As Voice of America reported, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the abolition of patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
According to the US administration, such a refusal should allow poorer countries to produce analogs of patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, and others were against it.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University reported on Monday that it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, almost 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the decision to send F-16s to Ukraine would be a "very serious decision" that is "not easy to make."
One of Ukraine's closest allies said this in an interview with CNN amid discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
According to CNN's Laura Kunsberg, in an exclusive interview in Warsaw to be aired on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16s would create a "serious problem" for Poland, because the Polish air force has fewer than 50 planes, and the Poles themselves "don't have enough... and we're going to need a lot more."
Duda also emphasized that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have "a very serious need for maintenance," so "it's not enough to just send a few planes."
President Duda's remarks came amid discussions of new arms shipments to Ukraine, including Western tanks and older missile defense systems.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has been persuading its NATO allies to send Patriot systems and Western-made tanks, such as the German Leopard, to Kyiv.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy embarked on an unannounced European tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with the means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelensky called combat aircraft "the wings of freedom" for Ukraine.
Zelenskyy repeated the same message in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelenskyy said he was "very grateful" for the assistance and hoped that the next talks on providing Ukraine with aviation would also be successful.
"I have heard from some European leaders about their readiness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aircraft.
Now I have a series of bilateral talks, and we will raise the issue of fighter jets and other aircraft.
That is why we continue our work here in Brussels," Zelensky said.
As reported by Voice of America, last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to transfer its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said that his government would consider Kyiv's request for F-16s.
Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden denied the delivery of F-16s from the United States, but Western experts believe that these planes may come to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that in the past, weapons that the United States refused to supply eventually ended up in Ukraine if European NATO allies agreed to transfer them.

CHISINAU, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, Moldova's president claimed that Moscow is plotting to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country "at Russia's disposal" and disrupt its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maia Sandu's briefing took place a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country had intercepted plans by Russian intelligence services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.
"The plan for the next period envisages the involvement of saboteurs with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will resort to violent actions, attack some government buildings and even take hostages," Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate government of Chisinau to an illegitimate one," Sandu said, "which would put our country at Russia's disposal and stop the process of European integration.
She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed."
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has been trying to build closer relations with its Western partners.
In June last year, it was granted candidate status to the European Union, the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several cases of organization of criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence."
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a NATO member, has faced a number of problems.
These include a serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply cut gas supplies; skyrocketing inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed into Ukrainian airspace and debris that was found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said that Russia wants to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the intelligence services contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry to Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that state institutions are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control," Sandu said.
She said that the Moldovan parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service and the prosecutor's office with "the necessary tools to more effectively combat security risks to the country."
The president added that the plan would "rely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups," and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are currently in exile.
Last year, the United States and the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on both men.
Last fall, a series of massive anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shora party also shook Moldova amid an energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday came after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Recean, as Gavrilita's successor.
On Friday, after the Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has for years supported campaigns of influence and destabilization in Moldova, often using corruption as a weapon to achieve its goals."

Stories from the war: "Grandma with a red flag" threw him away when she learned about Bucha
An employee of the Center for Strategic Communications found the woman.
üîª A living symbol of "pro-Russian Ukraine," the woman who, according to Russian propaganda, "bravely confronted the nationalists," is actually grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only support her with food, but also protect her from the wrath of ordinary Kharkiv residents.
üîª Anna Ivanovna explains that she came out with a red flag to what she thought was the Russian military so that they "would not destroy Ukraine."
And in the aggressor country, her motives were distorted, which is why she now feels like a "traitor."

Weapons and military equipment removed from storage in the Western, Central, Eastern military districts and the Northern Fleet are being transported by rail to the areas bordering Ukraine."
Details: The enemy did not conduct active operations in the Volyn and Polissya sectors.
There were no significant changes in the situation in these areas.
Designated units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in Brest and Gomel regions.
The threat of enemy missile attacks on military and civilian infrastructure throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus remains, as well as enemy provocations on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine.
Abandoning Soviet weapons and switching to NATO models - Zaluzhnyi
Ukrainian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi had a telephone conversation with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.

Zaluzhnyi's direct speech: "We also discussed with my American colleague a promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will complete it.
I also briefed General Milley on the difficult situation in the east of our country, particularly in the Izyum and Sievierodonetsk sectors, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most capable groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we are ensuring defense, holding our lines and positions."
- "Whoever invented this hellish summer was clearly out of their mind!" complained Dikorosla and stretched her arms out in front of her as if to reach for the ghostly coolness.
-"You say the same thing every time," Varta said indifferently, stirring the ice in the cocktail. "In the fall, because it rains and drizzles and the grass rots.
In winter, because it is cold and the herb freezes.
In the spring - because it's raining again...
-"You could sit in your Carpathians," Varta shrugged indifferently.
Although she didn't particularly like the city either.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and fuss.
The girl liked to imagine the familiar streets as calm, quiet, and green as they were a hundred years ago or even earlier.
But there is no such magic that would allow us to return to the past.
- Phew!
You say that!" The wild woman slapped her palm on the table, and the vases of flowers rattled timidly. "You should spend a week in the meadow with my grandmother Rutmera and her colleagues, praying to every truck that passes by that they would just take you away from there to any city.
Unless you liked to weed the beds from morning to night, sort through the herbs, hang them from the ceiling, and sing old chants at the same time.
My grandmother insisted that without the words, none of my potions would be as good as they should be.
And wait, I haven't even mentioned the nightly chore of picking up all the stuff!
You would have died before a week had passed!
Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, that they like this "work," that it is their conscious choice, and so on.
But if you start to really understand this topic, it becomes scary...
The problem of Ukrainian women being lured into prostitution is particularly acute today.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had an idea to legalize prostitution... that's why I didn't treat him very well.
I think we need to adopt the experience of Sweden, which has a kind of "Swedish model".
At the same time, they punish the client, not the woman.
Women are helped to get out of this "business" and make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything else.
Men should also think about whether they are buying "pleasure" or violence...
I need something else... you can show me where the nearest optician is with a doctor to write a prescription for glasses.
I also need to buy a high-quality frame... I looked at some websites with frames and was pleasantly surprised - they are cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $300 for them, the frames were of an average level (or even lower).
I don't know what kind of frames are in stores, but the prices in online stores are pretty normal.
But as for some cosmetics, I can say for sure that they are more expensive.
There are a lot of cheeks.
Multifocal lenses for glasses are very expensive in our country (compared to our average salaries).
Given our family's budget (especially the fact that we need to rent a place to live), $300 for glasses is a pretty high amount.
Did your doctors offer you an artificial multifocal crystal?
I wore soft contact lenses for 10 years, then I developed lens intolerance, and for another year after that I wore hard lenses, and I became very allergic to almost all cosmetics.
I have been wearing glasses all the time for 4 years now, and I rarely wear lenses.
Yes, I've also read that covid affects eyesight.
Also, after the age of 40, there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than $1,000, which was very, very expensive.
Yes, glasses are fashionable now.
I asked one doctor why he didn't wear lenses or get laser correction, and he said that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of UAH 1500, this is an unrealistic amount
My glasses now mask wrinkles
Yes.
My mom has little work experience.
She didn't work much: first, she had small children who were often sick, then she took care of her grandmother... so the state gave her a minimum pension.
His father earns 3,800 hryvnias and has 40 years of service.
My salary was about 8000 hryvnias, and I had to pay all this money for rent.
In good times (before Covid) there were bonuses, but with the onset of quarantine there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
That's why many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for their families or to buy a car, but then they lose contact with their families...
Yes, there are advantages.
But whenever my husband has a day off, he goes to the apiary.)
Good night
According to the order, the seaports of Berdiansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, and Kherson are closed until control over the said seaports is restored.
It is stated that this decision was made due to the impossibility of servicing ships and passengers, ensuring an adequate level of safety of navigation and environmental protection during Russia's military operations in these regions, which threaten human life and health.
The Russian Federation uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, Reuters reports this, citing a statement by the British Foreign Office.
"The British Foreign Office said on Sunday that Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation on social media about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including: Britain and South Africa," the article says.
It is noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came to these conclusions on the basis of an expert study.
"The agency said the study exposed how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign works to manipulate international public opinion about the invasion of Ukraine, strengthen its support and attract new sympathizers," Reuters writes.
According to the study, the troll factory "used Telegram to attract and coordinate new supporters who then acted against Kremlin critics by bombarding them with comments supporting President Putin and his war."
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
"Traces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including: Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok," the statement said.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in this regard that her government has already "warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations."
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadowy troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war," concluded Truss.
Ivanna, I'll explain to you now.
You have such a hair structure that all your hair is almost the same length.
Very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest possible result, you need to either do hair filleting.
But this will greatly affect the density of the hair.
That's why I didn't do it.
Or do root coloring to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I also did not paint the roots.
Therefore, the transition may be a bit abrupt.
I can fuse the transition for you, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be dyed to match your color, so when the hair grows back, you won't notice the difference.
About the quality of the hair.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
The hair may become drier, which is normal because it's blond.
It is impossible to make such a blonde without losing quality.
If you take proper hair care, your hair will return to its normal condition.
Please tell us which Matrix care you use.
Perhaps it's too weak for a blonde.
We can schedule a free tint to make the transition smoother.
This photo also shows a rather abrupt transition.
Because there is a large percentage of blonde in the root zone.
Please write to me when you can come over so that I can have a look.
If we do tinting, it will take about three hours.
There is a lot of positive from what I do at my job.
I help people - this is the most important thing, and this is what I wanted.
Even if it is in this way, it is helping people who hardly anyone in the world helps and says "good day" with a smile.
Today I found some great basic Czech lessons on the Internet.
I clean the rooms where the homeless sleep in the morning, I'm alone at this time and the doors to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons with headphones and repeat after the lecturer.
From the outside, I talk to myself, but it's good that no one sees or hears me at this time üòÖ I think I can learn the language like this for an hour a day.
So another huge positive of this work is learning the language with headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ.
Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
Its longest period of peace lasted 12 years, between the 1956 attack on Hungary and the 1968 attack on Czechoslovakia.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
The majority of the modern territory of Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, which had a significant impact on the formation of the cultural background of Russians.
The cult of conquest and raids has been successful throughout Russian history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then during the 20 years of Putin's regime.
These cultural characteristics have shaped state institutions that cultivate a policy of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of wars of conquest because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
Russians have not yet felt the full impact of economic sanctions.
Their living standards have not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protest movements inside the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand tougher sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia poses the threat of a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military shells and seizes nuclear power plants in Ukraine.
The Chornobyl NPP was de-energized.
They fired from tanks and took control of Zaporizhzhya NPP, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also seen over the South Ukrainian NPP in Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia is violating Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits the attack on nuclear power plants.
A missile hit, overheating of the reactor or spent fuel due to power and water supply disruptions can lead to radiation leakage.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia does not have to press the "red button" to cause a catastrophe on a global scale.
Support Ukraine - the Russian threat can only be overcome together!
Russians are robbing Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural machinery, and the first harvests from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a deliberate policy of Russia: For example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk region have decided to "expropriate the surplus harvest of last year and this year" from southern Ukraine.
The occupation authorities are taking away seed from farmers, but at the same time demanding that they successfully conduct the sowing season in order to send new crops to Russia.
It prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, he threatens with physical violence.
Russia is repeating the USSR's policy of massive robbery of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
This was the beginning of the Holodomor in 1932-33 and the destruction of private property on Ukrainian lands.
Under the guise of a "war of liberation against the Nazis," Russia is provoking famine in the occupied territories and destroying Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country refuse any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers take children hostage in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
They force their mothers to find out the location of the Ukrainian military, and threaten to kill their children if they refuse.
People are being pushed to make a tough choice: to lose their children or to become traitors to their homeland and be punished for it.
Human Rights Ombudsman in Ukraine Lyudmyla Denisova has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated a legislative amendment "to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbas."
Call on your government and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don't like their indecision.
Thousands of people are dying because NATO does not close the skies over Ukraine.
More than 50,000 civilians have been killed.
However, without Western weapons, we would be powerless, but I must say that they come in insufficient quantities and with a delay.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think that this is beneficial for the alliance itself, because with weapons from NATO and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe.
Did you know that a Ukrainian invented a way to reload the "disposable" nlaw anti-tank system?
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage
Russians deserve the worst and the most horrible things imaginable.
So to some extent, I am happy about what is happening.
Because this war has been going on for more than 4 months, it started around the 15th century, I don't remember exactly now.
But all these hundreds of years they have been trying to make us their slaves.
No sooner does one generation die than another is born and takes up the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished, and now they have returned to us again.
This story has happened before, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state.
In general, it's crazy for me to realize that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the rapidity of events, I didn't even have time to comprehend and reflect on the fact that there was a war going on and what it meant to me
It's great here, but I need to learn the language and go to work, I can't sit on the Czech state's welfare, but the problem is that my husband doesn't want me to go to work, there are constant quarrels, and we will have to go back to Ukraine, but we could stay, but he will do everything to make us go back.
He doesn't want us to live here - that's his answer
Yes, he is happy that we are here, but he doesn't want us to stay at home all the time, I took the children to school and swimming, I asked him to let us stay here after the war, and he said that we would go home right away, he would not make us documents
I probably won't be able to leave on my own if he has a long stay, and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic
Prolonged beatings
When the war is over, I want to learn to be a hairdresser and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic, if he doesn't want to, then I will probably have to go to a lawyer.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine he said he would))) now I know the truth
Yes, thank you, we will get out of the situation, the main thing is that the war is over!!! everything will be fine!!!!
I think the reason is that children in the Czech Republic want a lot of things, they ask him for toys or to go to McDonald's, they scream, they run around the house, and he is used to peace, that no one bothers him and does not ask for anything less.
Outside the train window, birch and spruce forests, magpies sprinkled with black and white confetti, and water trucks and freighters were fluttering, dusted with a fine gray rain.
Comrade Operative Orrrv was lying on a narrow Spartan bed, which was familiar to him, because it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed at home.
He unwrapped a simple business traveler's kit - rye bread and lard wrapped in a gray cloth.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in his food and unpretentious in his life; he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so easily, because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he leaned over the old, browned suitcase and carefully removed the crystal dome with both palms, which glittered dimly in the gray light of the middle lane.
- "What is it, comrade?" a young cadet, his neighbor, asked him in fright.
- "A rarity," Comrade Orlov said with a tenderness that was unexpected for him, placing the skull securely on the compartment table, "a very interesting and inflammatory thing.
This is, so to speak, my friend...
Yes, I watch work on 5 websites.
But unfortunately, I find work for men, for special education.
I do not speak Czech, I am a teacher of young children, I am not an engineer and I do not have a driver's license.
There is also a big question of finding a place to live.
It's my first time abroad and I just don't know what to do or how to act.
I haven't been able to find a job for a month now, I've only been cleaning a house.
I understand that the situation in Prague is very difficult, so I don't even go there
Here I have problems anywhere üò≠ I'm abroad for the first time, I don't know the language and I'm all alone.
The agency fired me and 20 other people after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find a job anymore.
I ask people, look at websites - nothing.
In this village I attend a course.
One lesson per week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, now the situation is such that I have to hold on to free housing while it is available.
And watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options ((
I don't want to just sit there, because the housing won't be free for long.
I understand
I don't want to charge you money.
I don't want the idea of lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in a regular city, not in the capital.
The three-day long journey from Ukraine and the big city with a foreign language scared me a lot.
I didn't come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
But to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Maybe you know someone in a small town?
I can look after children, cook, clean, work in the garden...
I know how to sew, I have been taught to sew on a sewing machine.
I used to make custom bedding and some clothes.
Perhaps there will be such a job.
I can do it!
Hugs and greetings to everyone!!! üôèüèªü§óü§óü§óü§óüíêüåû
I am very glad to read you!
We have another air raid now(((
More than 100 missiles flew into Ukraine today üò°
Today I worked with the wounded, so it was hard to concentrate.
All my thoughts were with the child.
Jan studied at home...
Everything will be Ukraine!
We are serving this evil!
In the surgical department, my colleagues and I volunteer
Sometimes it's overwhelming, of course))))
Then I clean, cook, and socialize))))
Because this is my home, my land!
Give my regards to everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! üôèüèªüíêü§ó
Thank you for your letter, and I am expressing my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the question of expelling or not expelling the Association of Russian Psychologists from European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is the most important thing.
Let me give you an analogy.
If one child takes a toy away from another child in the sandbox, the adults watching the children will most likely try to reconcile the children and after a while the game will continue.
If one child in a sandbox starts hitting another child in the face with a spatula, that child will be isolated for a long time, and no one will play with him or her.
I also liked the analogy of a Russian psychologist colleague who said that when someone from the neighboring apartment kills someone, the entire apartment building is not imprisoned.
There is a lot of discussion among Ukrainian psychologists about the exclusion of Russian associations from European ones, and many feel so much pain that they cannot stand to communicate with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to cooperate with several psychologists from Russia that I know and share knowledge in order to treat traumas of clients from both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and I have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who, at their level, are trying to do many things to develop universal values in Russia.
So I am definitely in favor of a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that 5-10% of the population in Russia supports the war, and the rest of the figures in opinion polls are added by propaganda.
My wife left her homeland Ukraine because the war is going on there.
My wife had a good job and, despite the war, she never left her home.
In order not to be on the Czech Republic's back, my wife is trying to earn money, because in 2009 she received a certificate of completion of a masseuse course in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money as best they can.
Now the only problem is to learn Czech.
My wife teaches languages and works and earns money for food, kindergarten, bus passes, mobile phone service, and clothes for her and her child.
At the same time, I am defending my homeland.
I am grateful for the support of people who understand this.
I am grateful to the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine in difficult times. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáøü§ù‚úä
I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to advertise my wife's massage services in your community.
My wife earns money on her own because she does not want to live on the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you.
I am sincerely grateful to you.
It really helps my wife earn money for her family.
Okay, I'll tell my wife.
I realize that many citizens do not understand the situation of Ukrainian people.
Some people are sneering at my wife's announcement, but my wife is offering her services.
My wife was a nurse in Ukraine, I work in the police, but the war separated us.
It's good that my wife wants to work and earn money and not wait for help from your republic.
ATTENTION!!!
AN AUCTION HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED!!!

Thanks to all of you, we have succeeded in ordering a thermal imager, which I will receive in a few days and hand over to our defenders personally (I will report back without fail)‚òùÔ∏è
However, as I said, there will be new goals and plans to continue to help our heroes!
It is sad and painful, but the war continuesüò™and our liberators need a lot of turnstiles, knee pads, military helmets, as well as folding field beds (some soldiers sleep in the open air on the cold ground) üòî
So, we are announcing an auction!

Supervision of students in class, during breaks and at school events by school staff.
Safety conditions while in the gym, on the playground and in professional classes
Rules of distance learning
If this is not possible due to the introduction of an emergency measure or quarantine
personal presence of students at school, the school provides distance education to interested students.
If a distance learning method is ordered at a school (class), students are required to do so.
The most important safety rules
In particular, it is prohibited to bring things that threaten health and safety to school and school events
weapons (including knives), drugs (narcotics), cigarettes and alcohol.
Smoking and the use of alcohol or other drugs are prohibited at school and at school activities.
I really need someone who can act as an interpreter for a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we have to deal with the insurance company to fix the car.
The insurance company invited a person who could translate from Czech into Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa during the technical inspection of the car.
Can you help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific paper based on a statistical analysis of the body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a separate population.
In addition, I also have experience in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in the research of the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped to monitor bat populations in the Kharkiv region, as well as organize hibernation for bats disturbed by people during the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills and learned how to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to read scientific papers on the moths, observe their life under a microscope, and talk to the scientists who study them.
So the option of a deeper study of these and other microscopic organisms also interests me.
How attitudes toward Ukrainians have changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees - expert analysis
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive refugee aid from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at meetings between the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.
The Czech President noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on many problems.
It has provided asylum to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
Approximately 500 thousand people arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors, Poland and the Czech Republic, and will be tirelessly grateful!
ProUkraine asked Jaroslaw Kot, coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin, how Poland is coping with the unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden.
He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has offices not only in Poland but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic has hosted up to half a million Ukrainians, and this has had a significant impact on the life of the Czechs.
There are long lines at labor offices and significant price increases in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government organized exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when the hostilities began.
It was foreseen.
People in Poland have been saying for months that there would be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, they were less prepared for what was going to happen, while in Poland they were actively preparing.
For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the war began, there were already certain plans for where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.
In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.
I heard that they laughed about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was a very deliberate thing to do: to prepare for all these events before the war began.
I would like to note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombing and the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance in logistics - transportation on the territory of Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.
These are airplanes that travel between cities in Poland, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I have had experience with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania, and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, it is not a million-plus city, as some may think.
The transportation issue remains extremely important.
Poland abolishes tolls for Ukrainians.
They can travel for free on trains and public transportation.
In addition, Poland has agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to travel free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
Mostly these are closed school stadiums, small stadiums, and complexes where temporary halls with beds are set up.
Free meals and free medical first aid are organized there.
The refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
The major cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, and Wroclaw have become very active, with entire Ukrainian neighborhoods now established.
The example of Warsaw is unique in the sense that they managed to get the Russian Embassy to take back the facilities that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes had been in a state of disrepair for decades, but the Russians would not let anyone in.
The Polish local authorities nationalized it, so to speak.
I took it in favor of Ukrainians, and Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
Water and electricity will be supplied there, and they will be insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine may already be living there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm passed and the Senate approved a law on fugitives from Ukraine.
According to the law, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medicines to Ukrainians.
You just need to write an SMS and get a code on your phone.
And in the amount of 5 thousand hryvnias, you can get medicines in Poland for free.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which is granted irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.
Various foundations are widespread, including Caritas and the Red Cross, which provide packages of food, chemicals, and clothing.
As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".
That is, "an event that has no analogues."
There is such a huge openness.
This is a huge expense for the Polish state.
The European Union has not yet allocated a single euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
The language problem.
The issues start with polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems and illnesses.
The second problem is schools, where students, especially in high school, are also at a loss at first, unable to understand the terminology.
I would note that Ukrainian children often arrive with a level of knowledge much higher than that of their respective grade.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Not only do the children have a good command of English, but their overall level is higher than the grade they are in.
This is also interesting.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine if they are rated so highly here.
Of course, language is important when applying for a job.
Unfortunately, for an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, or lawyer in Ukraine, it is much more difficult to master this job here.
As a lawyer or accountant, I don't know of any such cases.
Doctors are now appearing in certain locations, in particular in Lublin, and the company has set up its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to treat the same Ukrainians legally.
The language problem is often the reason why families return home after a few weeks of staying here.
There are many such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have had a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, and now they are coming back.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active hostilities.
They did not settle down here, did not find work.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs, and therefore they would prefer to return home.
This is also one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.
How attitudes toward Ukrainians have changed
According to the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, there have been significant changes.
Whereas earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians to be exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles feel about millions of Ukrainian refugees?
Poland has a similar situation.
Here, all TV channels often quote the statement of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who was tragically killed in Smolensk.
When Russia attacked Georgia, he was in Tbilisi together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state.
He said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop with Georgia, and then maybe Ukraine.
Then there may be the Baltic states, and it may even reach Poland.
That is, he seemed to foresee it.
In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, and their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes and help Ukrainian refugees so unselfishly.
Poland sees the threat.
Despite the fact that Poland is a member of NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.
Therefore, the attitude has changed to a positive one.
The Ukrainian flag and the Ukrainian anthem are no longer a "song of nationalists" or some enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are still small groups among the population that have not changed their views; they exist in every country.
But fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think very differently about Ukrainians than they did before.
The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians keep saying that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
In Poland, this is perceived with a laugh, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, with no political overtones.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced a change in public opinion among those segments of society that still had doubts about some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
Poles, when they start thinking that there might be a war, immediately begin to realize that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as much as they are doing in Ukraine today.
People from Mariupol, Bucha, and other Ukrainian cities are constantly talking about them.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst-case scenario, as a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously considering their own security.
Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How are the Polish authorities and society reacting?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland is doing this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
Poland is currently conducting an additional recruitment drive for the territorial defense forces.
In other words, such preparations for various military scenarios are taking place.
Citizens can feel that the state is preparing for such events.
This includes the recently adopted new law on national defense, which significantly increased the budget for Poland's military needs.
The requirements for recruiting military personnel have been changed, and many aspects are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.
Your predictions came true in Syria, you warned of a Russian attack.
What would you say about the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for a nuclear strike, I don't really believe it.
But such a scenario exists.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative of NATO countries, including Poland.
According to various estimates, it could take place in the Volyn region.
I would not like this to happen, but it is the worst case scenario.
A low-powered strike, but one that all TV channels would show this "fungus".
To be seen in Poland and the Baltic States.
In this case, the Russians expect that NATO troops will escape and lose their combat capability.
Positive scenarios are associated with the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, problems of Putin's entourage, oligarchs who are now suffering from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.
We have the facts of the Sakhalin hydroelectric power plant fire, and some evidence that people are beginning to resent the prices.
Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my forecasts, I wrote that Russia would split into 19 small countries.
There are also trends toward a peaceful resolution of the war.
Various EU countries, such as Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop a significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their need for Russian energy resources.
At most, it will take until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing a possible suspension of gas supplies.
This will be a very significant blow because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Since I am an analyst, I foresaw this.
I simply turned off the gas in my house in advance.
My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there are a very large number, millions of Polish families who will feel the price increase.
Citizens won't feel it for the first few months, but prices for all resources will definitely start to rise.
Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.
In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, and there is a very huge port in Poland.
Regarding oil, we have a striking factor that the Hungarian prime minister is actually cooperating with Putin.
Currently, gas stations in Poland are being bought out by Hungarian companies that will use Russian oil.
These are also very sensitive topics that touch on geopolitical and international issues.
If Europe refused to buy Russian energy, it would be a loss of a source of funding for Russia's military.
Even a schoolchild understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose its ability to exist and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in the Polish media
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Polish media.
What do the Polish media say about this?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased dramatically.
And this growth is considered unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about the real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city in the war zone.
In other words, the president's actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.
They show that the Ukrainian authorities are maximizing their efforts to obtain military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discusses these topics in a very positive context in relation to the Ukrainian government.
There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in the Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.
You don't hear that here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because Ukraine's image in terms of heroism, endurance, and ability to fight the enemy has grown significantly.
It does not fade or fall.
That's the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.
In fact, Ukraine's image is holding up, and this is very important.
Good morning.
Sorry to bother you with my problems again.
I am very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
Yesterday we tried to come to something, but it was in vain.
Her mother-in-law's friend, who helped her find the apartment, also joined the conflict.
She said that she was not looking for it for us, and if we were not satisfied with something, it was we who should leave and she would make sure that her mother-in-law, not us, stayed here.
Unfortunately, none of them thinks about the child, who is used to this place and considers it his home, and in 3 months of change there have been 6 homes.
I am very sorry, I could not have guessed that this situation would happen
Once again, I apologize for the trouble.
As for the bed, the situation looks strange.
We discussed this issue with my husband before I wrote to you that I didn't need a bed.
He came here to see me and the baby and he really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law decided for herself that he would sleep with her in the room and she didn't care about his opinion and wishes.
I am very ashamed of you, your husband, Sharka, and Jan, the landlady.
You have tried so hard for us
I understand.
I thought it was going to be extended for a long time.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andriy's treatment, to do this at least until the end of the summer?
Maybe we need a certificate for Andriy that he is sick.
In Ukraine, a person with this diagnosis would have been assigned a disability.
And since Inna does not go to kindergarten yet, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the house
I see, then it would be nice to go with you tomorrow.
I will make a barcode for myself and Andriy
I'm worried that they will stop providing humanitarian aid for him, and his treatment and rehabilitation will take a long time.
Do you have any advice?
I also wanted to ask if you received the money for the medicines you bought for Andriy.
The pen mount falls out.
It is short, so you need to be very careful not to lose it.
Today, only 2 portions were sold.
The apricot is over.
Poured in the mango.
Mangoes don't go well.
Most people wanted apricots.
Now they buy more vanilla because they don't like mango.
Norm, here comes the mango.
But it started to creak againüò≠
We started to take ice cream actively and he can't copeüò≠
Tomorrow there will be black currants
Today we will definitely run out of mangoes, and black smoke
I'm shaking all overüò≠
It freezes again, creaks.
Hudnes on 4.0.
As soon as people are actively taking it, he doesn't let the ice cream in at all.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
It's just that as soon as the line for ice cream gets long, he starts giving out such nuances and people move on.
Freezes .
If one ice cream is missing, it will squeak and rub the piston.
And you can't put vanilla in mango.
Can Magdalena come tomorrow at 8:00?
We need to wash the ice cream.
Today we're out of ice cream, and tomorrow we'll have a different flavor.

Maidan is a place where people protest
Mykola Mikhnovsky first read the text to independent Ukraine in 1990
He was an ordinary man who fought for the independence of Ukraine
Leonid Kravchuk was the first president of independent Ukraine
I believe that there was a dictatorship because people had just left Russia and could not really understand whether they liked being an independent country or whether they wanted to be an autonomous republic of Russia
When Ukraine was independent, there was already Kyiv, but in the Soviet Union there was a city called Kharkiv from 1912 to 1934
I can't say that there were any other interesting events, but if there was democracy at first, it was much better and probably now we were in the European Union
