Diego Cocca becomes Mexico's new national coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the United States and Canada, set up the World Cup for the first time with 48 teams. Cocca is applying for the succession of Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old did not rank among the favourites for the post until just a few days ago. He had not taken over as coach of Mexican club Tigres until November. His surprising appeal to the national coach sparked anger at the club.
Geesthacht: New beds signs are to be animated for replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht blossoms up" also includes information about what is just flourishing there - currently in the colours white and pink.
Thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought to Earth since 2015, with the help of many volunteers from associations, schools, nurseries, businesses and institutions. Target: In the Geesthacht town area, flower bulbs and plants are to emerge, where insects find food at all times. "On favourable weather conditions, the bees fly out as early as January to seek food," Friedhelm Ringe of the Geesthachter Nabu says. He himself has hives on the property.
In order not only to keep an action from nature conservationists and the city’s professional service environment, but also to draw wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory boards are always put to the plants. About 50 signs are up to now. Passers-by are supposed to be able to inform themselves in this way, which flourishes so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will replant at home.
In the first week of January was already the start of the season at the Wildhasel
Recent dates are shrubs such as winter eagle kirk and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the Kübel on the Bergedorer Straße for a year now, show the first delicate flowers in white and pink, and have recently been considered with further signs. "The Winterduftheckenkirsche is a very wide bush shrub and can grow between two metres high and three metres wide," can be read there, for example, to the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasises that it is not only the beetroot plants that show flowers. In the first week of January it was already a season start at the Wildhasel. It flourishes particularly lushly on the slopes, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
Munich - Dance God Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of her when he looks down from the sky to the Munich East Railway Station!
Every Monday they meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at point 3 p.m. three ladies to the fleeting stepp dance - together they are unbelievable 277 years old, pardon young!
The eldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich native (15 January 1921) of the Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is the climax of the week.
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (nearly 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing the dance legs.
The 97-year-old is in Jena (Thüringen) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today you would say musical performer, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life with dancing, acting and singing."
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something like chicking in the round of step dancers. She says, "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl."
Wikipedia: Stepptanz was developed in the U.S. in the 19th century and is now known everywhere in the world. With two metal plates that are more durable than the initially used wood soles, front and back on the shoes, rhythmic sounds are generated when dancing, which suits the visual impression and music. The dancer is thus also the percussion musician. The English expression for this is loudly danced and the French clquette. The Spanish flamenco may have influenced the stepp dance. At the same time, the tops of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a good sound while dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at the East Railway Station. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, with us are big and small, old and young welcome."
And what's the recipe for such a long life? "I keep the exercise young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of Digital
As digitalization progresses, the desire for analogue grows again
The Rasanz, with which our everyday life became digital, hardly left us time to set rules for dealing with it and adapting our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you were among the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were among those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could phone for a bottle of Radeberger with the kinship. Or you were looking for a phone cell. Unforgetting the smell of the plasterer and clicking the small-money coins in the vending machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see each other's face when calling - picture telephony, I thought, what would be a great thing!
How on in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has appointed former Home Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old business expert now has 14 days to do so, so far Recean has been one of the president’s advisers.
After just a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure. As she herself announced as a statement for her demission - apparently she was fomented by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for their "enormous victims."
Moldova is neighbouring Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is above 40 percent and the small republic has picked up tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Parliament of Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (party of action and solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, as it seats 63 of 101, and the confirmation of the new Head of State and his Cabinet is therefore unlikely to be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the Promises
2023 will be celebrated again neatly in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the prominence didn't ask for long.
His father, Markus Söder, did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself as the tribal elder of Bavaria. On his side wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bayern's environment and consumer protection minister, Thorsten Glauber, has opted out of the Paw Patrol's children's hero Chase for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franken came Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich and Ms Anja.
Completely distinguished: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, pulls it into space.
President Ilse Aigner did not seek any less than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's health minister Klaus Holetschek alongside Gattin Birgit.
Bob the Builder alias Bauminister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's gold boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff in the carnival: Bavaria's interior minister Joachim Herrmann. On his side wife Gerswid.
On the Walz: Economy Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to the craft with his costume.
The political opposition, of course, was not allowed to be missing.
All for Bavaria: Green-Parina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-founder Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD parliamentary chief Lust: Florian von Brunn with SPD leader Ronja Endres.
Royal became a member of FDP parliamentary chief Martin Hagen, and he and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
He certainly speaks more otherwise. In Veitshöchheim, the group chairman in the EU parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime. On his side, Ms Andrea.
When he can't cope with politics, he can conjure Nuremberg's OB Marcus King as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermine.
Flott on the road as a beeline: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, BR-Intendantin Katja Wildermuth and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side-step against the climate activists from the Franconian crime Commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The first mayor of Veitshöchheim was of course not allowed to miss, Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn Achter in the World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now already collected 14 World Cup titles and continues to close to his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on the spot as a TV expert, is still undisputed record-breaking with 20 World Cup gold medals. Even partly strong fog prevented permanent winner Bö from collecting his second gold at the racecourse. On Wednesday, it had already topped out for the successful title defence with Norway's mixed relay.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in hunting race. In the chase, Bö is once again the clear favourite. His running form is outstanding, so he can easily offset shooting errors to a certain degree.
At Doll, however, nothing happened again. After the Routinian had given all odds of a medal to the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there had only been a place six, it didn't run any better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in the lying-in-state and two more standing were a huge disappointment for the elder in the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in that discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago with 0.7 seconds of precedence from Bö. It was one of a total of just three career successes by Doll, who was once on the podium so far this winter. Beijing's Olympic ace pulled wordless from it after his weak appearance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees managed to finish 19th, second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden welcomes Lula: "must advocate for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazil counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is primarily about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
U.S. President Joe Biden bragged for the preservation of democratic values on a visit by his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We need to continue to advocate for democracy, for the democratic values that make up the core of our strength." Lula countered with a view to his right-wing incumbent Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated for four years."
Left-wing politician Lula had prevailed at the end of October in a runoff election against Bolsonaro. On January 1, Lula took office. The change in power was accompanied by heavy wreaths. Followers of Bolsonaro had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the government seat in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil recalls in dire fashion the storm on the U.S. Capitol a good two years ago, in which followers of then-President Donald Trump violently invaded the House in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. "His world started and ended with Fake News, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "Come to me well known," Biden replied - an obvious nod to his incumbent Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Do you remember the RAF flag posters?
In a country with a culture of denunciation that existed even before coronavirus, so public sentiment was made, against the most dangerous opponents of the BRD; let's say civil democracy, let's say to late-capitalist society. (Nothing to the really dangerous in needle stripe suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgart newspaper, which is otherwise rather behind Raudis in the S-Bahns or onanists in the park, gives a reboot with the "war criminal" of Putin's friends. Because those are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are in this world of Asia, Africa and Latin America perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not about it, but: Ms. Wagenknecht is on place 1 to 5 (!), then Ms. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who reads this sheet. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the known level, where nothing is under it anymore.
And at the latest, well dialectically, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all those who are not yet completely dissolved, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and antimilitaristic. (And there is no need for differentiation here.)
Harald Glööckler filed for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Confirmed Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "pictured" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. There, he says, "I can confirm that my client has filed a request for his life partnership through his family lawyer. I do not outweigh details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were 35 years together, break-up rumours had existed for about a year. After his jungle camp participation, the fashion designer is said to have already moved to Berlin from the shared home in the Palatineate, according to various media reports. He also spoke on the RTL show about marriage issues.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
A memorial center was set up in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, the ruins of which were preserved. France's President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. The survivor had advocated, among other things, for German-French youth encounters.
A curved position for 14 houses: in Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ-series Nordlippische Weiler: In Homeien, there are not rarely three, four generations living under one roof. Here the residents find Idylle pure. In the summer, 300 motorcycles a day also brew the curvy route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some also return.
German bank chief Christian Sewing thinks further interest rate hikes are necessary in the fight against the high rate of interpreting "absolutely." "The inflationary risks are further big. The cost of energy can rise slightly again, and China's opening up can also temporarily give prices a boost," Sewing told the "world on Sunday."
The European Central Bank (ECB) had raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row in early February, and a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key rate in the euro area, meanwhile, is 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates are depleting loans, which can slow down demand and thus counteract high rates of depreciation. Higher borrowing rates can also cause investment to be deferred and thus weaken economic growth.
Even for highly indebted euro states such as Italy, rising interest rates are a strain. "The consequences of permanently high inflation are much more severe than the higher funding costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we need to keep that in mind, but a high level of debt must not stop the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area in the medium term at a forecast rate of two percent. This target has been far away for months. While the price boost weakened again in January, consumer prices in the euro area, meanwhile, were 8.5 percent above the level of the previous month.
Higher inflation rates are decreasing the purchasing power of consumers, as they can afford less for a euro, and sharply increased energy prices, which are driving inflation, are also a burden for businesses.
If inflation stays high, private consumption will "break in sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also the president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "Therefore, I see the greatest danger to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch head Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany-Tempo" declared by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) on infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and societal dialogue on that. And he may as well be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a rulebook will come out, with which it may not necessarily have to go as quickly as with the LNG terminals in operation at the time of the change in the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, the first German terminal for imports of liquefied liquefied natural gas (LNG) had been opened after ten months of planning and construction time. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply a bit wide due to lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany temperature." Moreover, the federal government had recently launched an acceleration of permitting procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government is acting so quickly when it comes to it. But that should not automatically mean that from now on, we always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind wheel into the garden against its will," Hartung said. There must therefore still be a negotiation process, which we find correct and wrong as a society.
In the past, we tried and did not manage to do it with the classic rulebook. "We should think again if the previous procedure was so correct. Maybe we also exaggerated it with the rulebook and made it too complicated for us."
Given the many open tasks, such as the expansion of electricity lines, he does not regret the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as it is."
Union warns of crushing Bayer group
The chemistry union IG BCE warns of a crushing of the group after an announced head change at Bayer. "From the perspective of employees, Bayer is just right up for the challenges of the future with his three standpoints," Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board, told the "Rhine Post" (Saturday edition).
"The transformation of the industry is only handled with a company policy based on risk sharing and sustainability - and not hedge fund activism."
Background is the head change at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemistry group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss, Werner Baumann, will still clear the post this summer. The former pharmacy head of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is expected to take over in early June.
Baumann has long faced criticism. The 2018 takeover of U.S. seed maker Monsanto for $63 billion depends on the manager. With the purchase, Leverkusen's expensive legal battles for alleged cancer risks from weed destroyer Glyphosat had caught up in the house. The Bayer stock was in sinking for years. In 2019, shareholders even denied the discharge to the board chief at the general meeting.
For a long time, it was known that Baumann was not seeking an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Pressure had long-term strategic investors. Lastly, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors like Bluebell Capital also mixed in. Bluebell insists on a split-up of the group, according to a media report.
The very small fund with an unknown amount of participation in Bayer is known for aggressive action. A break-up of "the Consumer Health sector would be a possible way to boost the corporate value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post." However, a break-up of the far larger agricultural sector Crop Science does not think it is feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions oppose the concentrated protest on the street, and hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform on Saturday.
In France on Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people are again expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, unions are mobilising against the mid-government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice, over a million people have already taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 attendees were counted at protests. A turbulent debate has been ongoing in parliament for a week.
Already, many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62, if they have not paid long enough for a tee-free pension with the age limit. In many exhausting professions, people could hardly work longer, the opponents of the reform think. Moreover, employees wanted to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not fully disguise their health in the job.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund
Macron bases the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. To keep the level of pension stable, the population needed to work a little more. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
However, it is not only at pension age that the government wants to screw up. The aim is to speed up the necessary single-payment period for a full pension, to abolish individual pension schemes with privileges for certain professions. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1200 euros.
Pension reform is considered to be one of President Macron's most important projects. During the coronavirus pandemic, a first start to the implementation of the reform was cut off, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Even some presidents before Macron tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - broad protest and strikes were all certain.
As Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to bring through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced support. Some of the MPs, though - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even bigger than the fear of a snap vote is likely to be the concern of paralysing strikes at the moment at Macron. Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said he could count on the organizer's sense of responsibility so that they ran quietly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected - in high places a lot of sun
A powerful high-pressure area is over central Europe and determines the weather in Germany, does that mean that there is a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, at least until midweek high pressure weather is expected. "Looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately catches eye across central Europe," explains the meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Zwar shifts a little to the east over the next week, but it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, quiet high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel.
On Sunday, it will start to rain in most regions. From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Niederbayern, it can also rain a little, according to the DWD. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens in the daytime and the sun becomes increasingly apparent. In the rest of the country, it stays heavily cloudy or high-nebulae. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the gradually becoming sun rises again at the high fog and can dissolve it more and more in the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the Central Mountains and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, it will be expected all day long, otherwise it will have to fight through the high fog ceiling. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, at the Lower Rhine are 11 degrees, in the permanent grey in the south-east are only expected by 3 degrees. To this, weak winds from different directions will blow.
On Tuesday, there may be only a tame resolution of fog or high fog in some precipitation. Otherwise, the weather will be cheerful after fog resolution. In high altitudes, in vast parts of NRW and at the edge of the Alps, forecasts suggest that the sun will shine all day. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator had: again not a World Cup medal for Goggia
Beaten top-favourite Sofia Goggia has shown heavy disappointment following her exit in the downhill of the alpine ski world championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I haven't brought the performance I can," the Italian said in the ZDF after threading in at a goal and getting out. After all, the 30-year-old could still prevent a possibly severe fall.
Goggia has been the dominant runner-up in the World Cup for years. Four of the six season races so far in this discipline, she has won. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she picked silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. On a World Cup medal in her parade discipline, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving but continues to wait. At her home game at Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago, she was missing injury-related.
"I actually thought I'd be good at it. It was about hundreds of a second," Goggia said after the surprise victory of Swissman Jasmine Flury in French Méribel. "I'm disappointed. I gave it all. But so is life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal all experts expected and ultimately missed, "are they but not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been reported missing since February 10.

Selenskyj and Minister Against Russia's Olympiad
Kyiv. With calls to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Paris Olympics, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
At a joint telephone conference, it was agreed to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports reported on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympics, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė said.
The video consultation had taken place at the initiative of Britain. It had been a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made it very clear to Britain's position: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now make a joint statement on the subject."
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terror state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Selenskyj said. He posted his speech in his Telegram channel. Because of Russia's attack war, ultimately, a neutral flag was also soaked with blood and not wearable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a warring party because the country provides military bases for attacks on Russian troops. Selenskyj called on the officials to advocate for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being allowed to compete. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which unfortunately lost its "honour."
The conference was the occasion of the IOC's announcement to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening to boycott should the IOC allow athletes to compete.
Federal Ministry of Home Affairs also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of Sport, which is responsible for sports, also stated at the deliberations to reject a launch of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "There is no reason from our point of view to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to apply the unfettered solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's aspiration to retake Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," a spokesman for the Home Ministry informed at dpa request.
Home Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed in late January that "the sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war Putin is waged against the Ukrainian civilian population. Large sporting events are not taking place in the air-empty space." Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics need to be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sporting stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly confess to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently declared that an exclusion "due to a passport or the place of birth" violated the ban on discrimination.
Creating where it happens
"Hey, horny butt!" whispering to the Närrin in the scarce sexy costume and calling out adorable proverbs: all this falls under the concept of "catcalling" (or cat calls). Behind the concept is no less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in the public space.
Half of vehicles lost? : US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
Half of vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. The speech is about the "holds of the main stock."
The Russian army has already lost half of its combat armour in its attack war on Ukraine, according to estimates by the U.S. Defense Ministry. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army had been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further details at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security about the number of tanks seized and destroyed, according to the U.S. estimate.
Ukraine is set to receive combat armour from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has pledged Kyiv to supply Challenger-2 fighter armour for March. Germany wants to supply a battalion of Leopard 2 tankers to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 combat tanks of the type Abrams. However, their delivery will last much longer in all foresight.
Russia wants to relay
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kreml chief Dmitri Medvedev set the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks in sight. "As we know, our enemy abroad has been bedrocketing around planes, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now vice-president of Russia's Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that it is a matter of course for us in this case to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
Already since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia, allowing for a stronger focus of the economy on the needs of the army, which can require, for example, individual industries to supply the armed forces.
Vertebrae for post assignment with Army
The post, which the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post-corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
A tendering was not required because the appointment to a job that has so far been unoccupied, according to the minister. "Specialities of a free staff representative" did not want to comment. Ortner was replaced in the past year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he faced heavy bullying allegations. These are cleared out of Tanner's view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts the content of Ortner, who is an expert in the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but deals with the current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process." At the decision, the "appearance of post treasurers," says SPÖ defence spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos call on Tanner to take back the appointment. The ÖVP plugs "more to the neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for state defense. He announced a parliamentary inquest on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees at expense
Thüringen's Carnival Tower of Wasungen, unlike the national capital, wants to hold on to the traditional carnival shift. However, the higher costs are difficult to cope with, among other things, for safety in washes, Carnival President Marcel Kißling says. The funds alone accounted for about half the total cost of moving.
In Brandenburg, there are no carnival shifts. The "train of cheerful people" in Cottbus, probably once again the biggest of East Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. Even during the Swabian-Almanian fast night, no relocations were canceled.
Schleswig-Holstein's Carnival Tower of Marne is holding on to the traditional move despite the increased costs. "We are pulling our event through," says Carnival Society President Heiko Claußen. But here too, the financial woes are pressing: if more sponsors were not found or the previous ones had to go to the point where backlogs had to be tackled - "this is not going every year." The deficit at the moment: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: in the case of confectionary products, there is partly an increase in the price of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. Due to happiness in misfortune, too much had been ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear for the move that it is becoming more expensive. For safety, twice as much staff is needed as in 2020.
Anyone who stands on the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland at the edge of the way might get less camels than they used to. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants don't have that much in it. Kamelle back or forth, the visitor sand rank is likely to be big: "I think if it shouldn't rain out of cubs on the day, then we can pretty much expect an elevated amount of people's sand," says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that two years ago, there was no regular rose Monday train. The train, of course, is to be replaced by nothing."
At the expense of the festival committee in Cologne does not express itself in detail, but the train is generally "deficient", which is no secret.
The Ukraine diary: Dreams and yellow-burnt vodka
Ukrainians aren't for nothing considered drink-resistant. There are domestic beers like obolon from Kyiv or beer from Lemberg. I always discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large-scale breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't find a big difference in taste. The same applies to the vodka, which is widespread. The same applies to the vodka, which is widespread. To whom they burn, especially on the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. How much of it is consumed exactly in the former Soviet republics, no one knows. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a whopping 80 percent. Well, you also see here how little you can believe the Russians. It means, as a tourist, you should be careful with it. But that only applies if it goes into the massive sales.
FC Hansa Rostock is rewarded for a lot of effort: "Match luck on our site"
Food and drink
Anyone who wants to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer to celebrate, find great locals in Rostock and Warnemünde for it. The restaurant scene offers plenty of locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glee for club parties. Where's it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favourite win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are greeted at the arena by Schornsteinfeger master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Cup sprint of Oberhof. But there were two glimpses of light in the fog.
As much as the federal president also tried, from the honorary gallery, it was not to be seen on Saturday whether the slices at the shooting alley actually fell. "I had to get the results over the cellphone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier shrugged, pointing to the fog swathes dragging back into the stadium that severely affected the view at the racecourse for viewers.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10-km sprint race at the Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof, receiving numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympics in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier had won gold in the first race, the biathlon fascinates me," he betrayed and praised Oberhof for his modernized sporting venues: "The round-renewed arena is great and offers ideal conditions. This is also what the athletes say - thanks to those who have dealt with the World Cup since the World Cup was awarded here."
Sporting once again, the Norwegian John Thingnes split the competition. Despite a penalty round after a shooting error, he secured the sixth win in the sixth sprint of winter - and thus his second World Cup title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless scoring brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian four-time victory perfect.
The native skiers couldn't step into the fight for the medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting error and with a backlog of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow scored flawlessly and became Twelve (1:14.6). Two glimpses of light behind the grey veil. Conversely, Benedict Doll disappointed again. After his sparse mixed turnover on Wednesday, the Black Forest this time left five slices standing and vanished as 55. deeply disappointed and uncompromising in the cabin.
Bö had entered the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested that status despite the intricate visibility. However, on his final two standing shots, he had the luck of the prodigious; they each ended up at the edge of the slices and fell anyway. The winner's award then enjoyed the 29-year-old then alongside his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to stand with him here," the world champion said: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the chase on Sunday. On the other hand, the German hopes for Herrmann-Wick rest. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as a tenth. There is only full gas and attack to defend the number one," sporting director Felix Bitterling took his "locomotives" into duty. The organisers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the doubles event (13.25 and 3.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych misses "beetail" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on refereeing ball.
Aggressive players or meckering coaches? Germany's referees want to "consequently punish" unsports. Referee chief Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Germany's top referee Felix Brych has made up negative tendencies in co-operation on the pitch. "I already find that there are new behaviours from the players that are ringing the referee a bit like a beetail after decisions and trying to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. "That's what we discussed in the winter break. We decided we don't want to accept such insports. We're going to pay more attention to that again - and will sanction it as well."
Lastly, two coaches had also been considered with place referrals. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat to FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "Also the coaching behaviour falls into the area of insports. We have noticed that insports have also grown in this area, that the behaviour has become a bit more demanding or aggressive to us referees. Even such insports we want to punish consistently," Brych said.
DFB Arbitration Judge Chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a fundamentally good co-operation between coaches and impartialists. "All in all, the ratio fits. There are reactions, thereafter consistent backlash follows. So the person affected must then live. This is not likely to be a world-moving thing," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"There may be conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotionality is overflowing into a personal denigration, it must also be accepted that the appropriate measures are taken by the refereeing side," Fröhlich said. In recent cases, the parties involved would have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be awhile if a rethinking process as a whole got under way that such a behaviour simply did not belong," Fröhlich said at the margins of an event hosted by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to potential impacts elsewhere. "Of course, occurrences from professional football are always coloring out. There is a role model effect, resulting from imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently responded to negative behaviors," Fröhlich said. "Indeed of the consistent rule interpretation in the game, a clear conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined Oftebro wins in Schonach
After a jump from the Normalchanze and the ten-kilometre-long cross-country ski race of Norwegians Jens Luraas Oftebro, the victory secured the Austrian leader Johannes Lamparter.
The German combinators don't compete in the blackforest in the standings. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not in it. They are preparing for the world championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from February 21, to March 5 in the Slovenian Planica. "We have three world-class athletes at home. That's what the team feels, of course," federal coach Hermann Weinbuch said in the ZDF.
Seven lightly injured after crash on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on Highway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a statement from police, it had happened on Saturday when a motorist encountered a carriage during a slight back-to-back drive from behind and swung him at two more cars. The full lockdown of the lanes towards Heidelberg had been lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
Have the exhibition launched: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (li.) and Georg Elben (re.) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marler Sculpture Museum.
The finissage for the exhibition "Wandbound" will take place at 3 p.m. on Sunday, February 12 at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarter of the Marler Skulpturenmuseum in Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. Two large-scale murals draw attention in three exhibition rooms each.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted, the artworks will disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art at the service of the community.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a free art historian and curator and has received his doctorate in 2013 on the wall painting of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching the history of architecture and the history of art and institutions of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art at the construction in NRW. Following the lecture, the last curator tour takes place through the exhibition. The artists and artists are on site.
Arrest warrants after building crashes in Turkey
It is about tree gaps that have favoured the collapse of buildings: in the Turkish earthquake region, judicial authorities have issued a warrant against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in the south of Turkey after building crashes during the earthquake. Arrest warrants have been issued in the city of Diyarbakir for possible tree defects. Arrest warrants were issued in the city of Diyarbakir, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, invoking criminal prosecutions. The accused are said to be responsible for tree defects that would have favoured the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the prosecutor's office in Adana also determines because of possible tree defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was called. One of the accused is said to have been taken at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and, meanwhile, sit in pre-trial detention, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were then arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
In the early hours of Monday morning, a quake of magnitude 7.7 had rocked the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another quake of magnitude 7.6 at midday. More than 7,500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former Prime Minister Hans Modrow died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left-wing faction reported in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died in the night to Saturday. Group chairman Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow was gone from us at 95," the left-wing faction in the Bundestag shared on Saturday, losing "a significant personality," group chairman Dietmar Bartsch and former group chief Gregor Gysi explained.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As prime minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on 13 November 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the popular chamber elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost office a month later. He succeeded him as the last prime minister of the GDR until the reunification of CDU politicians Lothar de Maizière.
In a message on the short news service Twitter, the group chairman of the left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist." Bartsch added:
"By age he was a key advisor to our party, whose cleverness will be missing."
"The whole peaceful course of the production of German unity was just a special merit of him. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. Further, it states:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS, always consisted of representing also that part of the former GDR population that was not wanting and whose interests were regularly violated."
Following the reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag between 1990 and 1994 and represented the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow had seen the new state as "utterly critical." Too quickly German unity had been carried out, too unconditionally the GDR had gone under, and too unilaterally it had been condemned as an "unlawful state," Modrow had criticised in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened at night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Selenskyj condemns Russian missile strikes, but Kyiv must do emergency repairs on the electricity grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile strikes is once again forcing emergency repairs on the Ukrainian energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several heat and hydroelectric power stations have been damaged, the head of energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television on Friday night. It looks particularly bad with the power supply in the Kharkiv area. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian electricity grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the AKW Chmelnyzkyj. Production was throttled at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power stations.
President Volodymyr Selenskyj condemned the Russian attack with about 100 missiles and marching missiles on Friday as a terror. In a video message, he reported to his compatriots how much support Ukraine had experienced in its trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to let the small town of Bachmut down
February 24 - War has prevailed for a year. U.S. President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland just before the anniversary. However, the danger of Russian missile strikes also continued into Saturday. In the capital Kyiv, for the fifth time for that day, air alerts were triggered late Friday night. "It threatens an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kyiv area shared. Fighting drones of Iranian design were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa areas in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Bund selects Adviser for Network Company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens from the campaign to divide them failed in the coalition partner SPD. In the Coalition Treaty, it had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure society, which should, however, be common-sense-oriented in the future. In other words, it does not need to make gains and pay off.
Remediation of EUR 80 billion
The two advisory firms are intended to help the Federal Government to accompany this process. The refurbishment of the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently very uninterrupted. Transport Minister Wissing has set out to eliminate this maladministration with the complete refurbishment of all rail corridors. The investments necessary for this have been estimated at EUR 50 billion so far. However, according to recent calculations of the railway, they are more likely to be worth up to €80 billion.
Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can anyone please pin me?"
The outer circumstances had certainly not spoken for Herrmann-Wick. She would have slept badly, she told after the race, had been "totally excited" who had not come down the pulse even when he walked in. "So a race," and that at the home World Cup, "you can't describe that with words," she said. 11,000 viewers joked about the draughty stroke music with Germany flags, supervisors and team falling into the arms.
" Enjoy biathlon," she had made herself
The pressure had been particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had started as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the seasons to the World Cup. Herrmann-Wick has won the world championship as the only German to win two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she currently ranks fifth. And even though the performance density in the women's standings is much higher than in the men's, where at the moment only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, one had others on the zeal for that sprint win.
Criticism of government - Bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison in Nicaragua
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing freedom of religion. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been heavily tense since 2018. At the time, protesters calling for the resignation of Ortegas had found refuge in churches. At the protests, more than 350 people had died in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of forging a composure to his fall along with the U.S. government.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special assets
First arms projects have therefore already been deleted, further projects threaten the same as the "World on Sunday" reports. Which investments would actually be scrapped, but could not yet be said. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to any savings requirements at this time," says the Federal Government in response to a request from the Bundestag MP Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-funded special asset decided by the Bundestag in June 2022 must bear the interest rate burden on the loans itself. If they rise, so less money is available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. Moreover, due to the current high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum is falling.
Copper cell: accident with 3 injured
At the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 p.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive to the motorway on the Kupferzell motorway to the left towards Heilbronn. At that point, a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 towards Künzelsau, as police reported. At the turn of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both of those involved in the accident stated that the traffic light installation installed at the site of the accident showed "green" for them. A review of the traffic light system revealed no complaints. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be taken to a hospital. The two cars had a total damage of around 20,000 euros.
Stuttgart Castle Square commemorates victims of earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib Mosque on Friday night
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria, with a large proportion of them also in Stuttgart.
At Stuttgart Castle Square, more than 200 people thought and prayed for them on Friday night.
A lot of community members had followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib Mosque community, boys like the old, women as well as men. They all listened seriously and silently to the imam's prayer. In prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. He asked, among other things, for health, protection against plagues and respectful dealing with each other. The community also asked help and force to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib is on the sidelines of the people of Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration event. The prayers were also translated into German in the Castle Square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great, and several million euros have already been gathered in the donation campaign of the German Islamic Association of the Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevitian community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected property donations in the bellows over several days, which are to be transported to the earthquake areas by truck, where the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hiking with meat deposit - Ebersberg
"After eating, you're supposed to rest or do a thousand steps".... The elders know the proverb, the disciples just put it into practice. So or so, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has experienced an unspoilt renaissance. For those who, thanks to home office, are not sitting in the middle of a stone's throw away from the screen or just a stone's throw away from the screen or just substituted for a walk to the fresh air. At least you could gain this impression around Lake Egglburg, where between 12 and 2 p.m., it's not just dog owners who are trolling.
One reason could also be because the human being of the modern age can connect the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of an optimal time slot use. Because why not experience news from the settlement on the occasion of a short march through the nature of the long-not seen neighbor? Or meet the friend, with whom you never manage to get to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? Also, in this way, you could connect the profession and private life - who says that the appointment can't take place outdoors with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor? Unless foreign ears are nearby, of course.
What you can also do in a good way is the purchase of natural fruits. Fresh fruit, for example, which is on top of a table at the edge of the path. Or potatoes and meat. Just fool you if you don't think about the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. For example, an older couple in Hinteregglburg leave the farmer's wooden sales room with blank hands and regrets in the voice. "Sorry, unfortunately, we forgot the money."
The disappointment can be felt, but you have yourself a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you let know of the sympathetic coincidence? What the man responds to: "That's not true, but you very probably have a bag in it!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat insertion and, on this lunchtime short trip, it has become richer not only for a lamb’s back, but also for a very practical idea. Well possible that a second walk will be due on that day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Clamped and seriously injured
At around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove with his Audi on the circle road towards Hailfingen and came off the road from the road to the right for a left turn to the right, according to the police report. In doing so, the Audi damaged a steering post, crashing sideways against a tree and staying a few metres away. Through the collision, the driver got stuck in his car. The fire brigade cleared him with heavy equipment. The rescue service took the seriously injured to a hospital. As the suspicion of driving incompetence persisted, the withdrawal of a blood sample was ordered. Total damage of € 1,000 arose at the Audi, according to police report.
Donald Trump's tax records: Point for the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has ruled that the financial authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump in 2018, still in office of President of the United States
The Ministry of Finance had to instruct the tax authority IRS to issue the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the ministry's decision stated Friday.
Contrary to political practices in the U.S., real estate contractor Trump had not made his tax declaration public either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted a subpoena until the Supreme Court. A New York prosecutor's office has since obtained the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless it comes to a trial.
The issue to Congress is arguably more delicate for Trump: there, the circle of accessees is a little bigger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation, and in addition, the House keeps intrusive.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promptly hailed the decision as a "win for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records was a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his hollowing of our security as president," Pelosi explained.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Between birth and death, life plays out
Kirchheim. Pasta or Pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which cellphone contract at the many offers? Stay or end? Either - or? As slaves of time, people from today heave from appointment to appointment and sometimes people and Hamburgers just push in between. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "between" condition has something agitating.
In a humorously thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings situations out of life. In her sensitive Chansons and crunchy-pointed cabaret songs, she brings a lot of things to the point - and the one or the other is also between the lines. Loss goes on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30 p.m. at the Kirchheim Club Bastion.
British serious criminal arrested after long escape in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender has been taken from the UK in Thailand. As British crime police told NCA on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police on Friday at a car shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of criminals most wanted by the NCA.
The leader of a criminal group had fled a trial in early 2018, in which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Meetings at the church table

Cabaret - stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the studied physicist from Unterfranken, who has lived in Vienna for three years and loves the Viennese humour according to his own statements, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo, "Make Science Great Again," fits well in here in the generally prevailing domestic skepticism. His humour, at any rate, fits very well with Vienna.
The English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, but he tried to get a foothold for a year in New York as a stand-up comedian. Now he's back there, telling his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences of overseas, but also explaining what knowledge-aft actually is and what it can and what, and most importantly, it can't. Of course, coronavirus is happening, but also German soundness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many push before: What really matters? All with a huge eye-width, unexcited and very ironic. And so not only are they well entertained, but they can also learn something about it.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the fighting from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are held in a wide valley completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level are rock pyramids and rock squadrons that provide the player with preliminary protection, as they can't be destroyed by opposing shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving chain vehicles and fast super tankers, as well as flash rockets, which, during the extended playtime, are increasingly difficult to hit. Additionally, UFO's appear to be still appearing at periodic intervals. These can't attack the player's filler. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score through a UFO encounter. The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) different operating types. These are the attraction sequence, the game induction sequence, the game abbreviation, the initial entry for maximum results and the self-testing process. The latter type of operation represents a special process for checking the controls and computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game is triggered when the START pressure switch is activated. The LED switch remains lit and the playing noises become audible. If the last player's tank is eliminated from the enemy attacker, a game has ended. The game starts with slow-moving tanks visible on the screen. The position of the respective enemy tanks or rockets can be determined by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left hint display angle of its cockpit. An indication can be e.g. loud: GEGNER OF RECHTS. Additionally, a point is visible on the wide-ranging radar screen, accompanied by a sonar-BLIP tone, which represents the enemy position.
If the opponent is in this area, it is good to typify it on the screen, and then it is displayed at the top left of the screen.
At times, UFO's will be visible on the screen flying over the battlefield. This is a dangerous flight body that observes the fight and cannot eliminate the opponent or the player's tank. The UFO's are said to round off the fighter and distract the player as they usually appear at the same time with opposing tanks or rockets. A shot by the player brings this 5,000 points. If a slow-moving tank hits 1,000 points, for a rocket 2,000 points and for a Super-Panzer 3,000 points. A Super-Panzer drives and turns twice as quickly as the player's tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several options give the viewer the opportunity to use for a game sequence 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be cleared and for another more difficult game design, the appearance of the rocket
5. Initial input at maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum point number in the table of maximum results, then ER or YOU can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after playing. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It must be noted that with the triggering of a self-tests, the bending of the RESET button on the Battlezone analog vector generator PCB or an interruption of the grid voltage, the table with the maximum results is deleted. When deleting (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores are obtained with their initials and re-inscribed on the screen to challenge further players. Each score that is above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their pders within 60 seconds, they will be auto-matically inscribed by the computer. Hereafter, the device changes back to the
1. New parts
The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with video devices from ATARI, you should note these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This one is a reconstruction of the ATARI locking lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, thus ensuring this building unit is more stable and a proper function of the switch contacts. Another amendment is the centrifugal beam made of rubber, which, like a centrifugal spring, has the control lever and the auxiliary board. With the help of displaced switching techni k, more lines are generated on the screen with a higher speed, given the extension of the circuit. D. The static housing. Due to the new design, it has now been possible to insert a new box with a larger coin-casting capacity. Furthermore, in the device, a console
These new components, as well as all other main components of this device, are shown in figure 1. If one of these new components is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Device Inspection
After removing the packaging, this new consumer device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should perform a certain review to round off the quality control. To be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following controls should be performed: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V network yetBen. A. Inspect the housing outer side for damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components within the device as follows: (1) Check all cable tree plugs for correct and fixed connection. Connect any open or loose plugs.
NOTE: Connectors never violently produce. The plugs are fitted with a forced guide so that a correct connection is produced. A 180 degree twisted plug connection destroys the PCB.
(2) Check plug connections to the play PC board for correct and fixed seating. (3) Note the device's manufacturing number on the type plate on the device back. Check if the punched manufacturing number is consistent with those of the Battlezone analog vector generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board and TV monitor for flawless assembly. (5) A picture of the attachment of the manufacturing number is located on the cover voltage and the TV monitor for flawless assembly. (4) A look through the display glass of the player is to check whether the radar screen is also in the light, orange-enclosed opening of the clasp and should be re-aligned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, ensure that the voltage picker on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local power supply voltage. Check the cable color at the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
Here are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems with current DirectX games. Check the system configuration
Please take the time and check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. Using the DirectX diagnostics program, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements. Please click on the "Start" button and select "Execute" option. Now you will see the user interface of the DirectX diagnostics program. You can check, among other things, whether graphics and sound function properly by clicking on the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer knowledge, we would advise you to change any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Program. Before starting the game, you will need to check whether you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card.
It may happen that other programs take into account the system resources that the game requires to run flawlessly. Not all of these programs are obvious that they are active, and many are automatically booted up. Such programs, which are constantly active on their system, are called "background applications." In some cases, they may be the cause of your program hanging or crashing, so we recommend that you close or disable such background applications before you start the game. Search the symbol of the program in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and choose the appropriate option ("Deactivate" "Close," or similar). - Once you have deactivated the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also end general background applications, as these sometimes lead to problems when you install or execute a PC game. More to do this, read the section "How to end all unnecessary background applications."
Before installing software, make sure your hard drive works optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need are supplied with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmentation and Data Media Cleaning so that everything runs flawlessly. Then the chances are that up-to-date games run largely smoothly on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus also other applications that you otherwise use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to find out about the tools ScanDisk or error check, defragmentation and data carrier cleanup. Use Windows Help
1. Click the Start button and choose Help (or Help and Support) to access Windows Help. 2. Now click the Search field and type the corresponding keyword, such as "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Check" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Data Cleaning." You will then get a guide to how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card, so you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First you should try to download the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INFORMATION
The desire to develop video games was sparked by the emergence of the 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expressing the world through which it was possible to get to grips with the world's boundaries. It presented me with a chance to discover new horizons. I imagined that even though it may be quite skeptical that driving can help to get into this new creative path and offer it with their own inspirations, their talent and ambition. In the past two years, driving has become a huge part of our life and presented us with the opportunity to discover all the basics of the game. In the past two years, driving has become a huge part of our life and presented us with the opportunity to discover all the basic principles that were previously perceived as irreverent principles. I would be happy when driving - similar to books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression

SERVICE-PROGRAMM
For programming and testing, the 4 switches, the self-test button and the LEDs are used on the video PC board.
Programming display. With this display, the language (English, French, spanish, German), with which the address program and the game work, is selected. With the help of the "sub-test" switch, the "test" switch can be set to the first line, and the hit points can be set to the screen. The value is set back, the pointer (so the green score value x 10 000) is determined to transfer to the first line (names) and the hit points to the screen. The value is set back, the pointer (so the green score value x 10 000) is determined to transfer the high score pointer to the next program ad to the next program ad. The value is determined by pressing the pointer (so the green score value x 10 000) is determined to transfer the high score pointer to the next program ad to the next program ad. The value is determined to determine the difficulty factor for the device.
"threshold": height of the % number to be reached to switch to the next passage
"time limit": Release for additional savings
"Difficulty": difficulty of the game
"Dress up": at "0" no sound at stand
for "1" sound also in stand mode (Animierton) "table model": for "0" stand
for "1" tableware
The credits per coin are set on the "shoulder" display. High score program display (heavy rate to now"). The scoring points and initials of the player, including the 10 next scores, appear. The values are used to adjust to high scores chosen on the previous display (setting "back"). By pressing the "Up" switch, the next program display will be set at 0. The total number can only appear at 0 when the battery or the plug-in connection W1 is set at 0. Right-handed coins: Number of credits given by the device. % Free spins: Number of minutes paid, in the case of extended or won game. % Leisure: Wound minutes/played minutes per 100. Average play duration in sec.: Played minutes/Payed + granted loans
High Score (Treffer rate): Number of players having enough high hit odds to push other players out of the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set at 0. Pressing the "Test" switch will appear the next program display.
Injection Slot Programming/Normal Money Setting With the help of this display, a default coin setting can be selected or a different setting can be programmed
If a default setting is foreseen, the program is selected while the top number is green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When reaching the right setting by pressure on the "Test" switch, the adjustment is taken to 0, which means that the values can be increased or reduced by pressing the "Test" switch, the default setting is set. When the lower values are unchanged, the default setting is set to 0, which means that the values can be increased or reduced. When the lower values are unchanged, the default setting is set to 0, which means that the values can be increased or reduced by pressing the "Test" switch, the default setting is set to 0, which means that the values can be increased or reduced. When the lower values are unchanged, the default setting is set to indicate how many coin units are close to each - by an assigned slot - a thrown coin is given. Coin units - "Kredit" shows
When "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, stored in dom all the programming, is out. All the values stored in the RAM will be set to factory default. This condition will likely indicate battery failure or error.
FEHLERSUCHE and SECTIONS
Beginning of the test method. Print the "Sub Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 close to the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can start. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" switch, the next program will be displayed. If a permanent test of the video board is required, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the auto test mode. When the display "Open Coin Door to Test" (open the coin door to test) appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the display J 19 is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = from / I = a / X = Test results
The ROM check sum calculates the test total of each video ROM and compares it to the amount stored for this ROM. If a difference exists, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the false test sum appears on the LED's. If the check total ROM is error hofed, the first U 10 is displayed. Gels this test does not, must be exchanged the next one displayed on the LED display. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be imported as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is chosen by the decoder plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the function security of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking if storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 When holding the Gerdt with the o.a. display, an error has been discovered. If the Communications RAM is running out during the video board test, the error may have arisen through a faulty wiring (RAM) or error in the data board. To locate the error, decrease the data board of P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means error in the U 3, U 4 or related power circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values are enrolled in another part of the memory, CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all storage points are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device is holding with the above display, an error is present. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated power circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing pre-defined number strings in the color RAM. These numbers will be checked for accuracy when reading back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, an error is present. Check U 56, U 57, related multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by enrolling a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancy brings the program to hold and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. When an display RAM fails, the problem is detected and the RAM replaces. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 to LED's), it is shown that the next check is started (Data Hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be operational.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No 1. The 2nd for the proper jacket to arrive without any recognizable seam flaws. ABER I was probably too happy for this jacket because the disappointment was all the bigger. I was oriented towards the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Because she should sit so tight and I did not want to fight in a S or M at my top.... In the end effect she would have fit from the length and at the hips...in the rest I could swim. Moreover, the lining material arrived at the opening of the package and distributed everywhere. Just just shame.. She will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered them for our daughter, she is totally excited. She otherwise wears the 158 and you fit the 36 in this case very well and is sure to be worn the next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I decided for the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the car lifter and this is not optimal. Unfortunately, I measured myself and the condition doesn't quite fit. But what my mistake is. Did then slightly change so it fits. The condition looks very robust and you can no longer damage the knives. You can use the use or the whole area. It works without problems. It slips nix more. I'd buy again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product in itself I'm completely okay, but not under a year. Since the area to chew is far too big for the little mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months and he couldn't use it for the size. Now at 12 months, we've been looking for him again and he can use it. Didn't even bite anything with his already existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it bothers him a lot.
Quality not sufficient / unfortunately goes back
I've probably been blinded here by the sometimes excessive reviews. I would like to say that I have already used 2 rucksacks from Lowepro. One very big (to store the equipment) and a pretty little one for the most important, everyday things that you have to keep up with. As a result, I have bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (knapp 29 EUR) and I am really happy about this protection, as my Lowepro can't say. So I decided for myself that the rucksack is much thinner and the materials of the compartments for the little stuff aren't really high-quality. The padded walls are much thinner and the materials of the compartments for the little stuff aren't really high-quality. I decided for myself that the backpack is much thinner and the materials of the compartments for the little stuff aren't to compare. So I decided
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far I had liked the electrics series of E. L. Todd, but my opinion was revisited with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also highly recommended and I really enjoyed the third part. In the part goes all the time about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn to the length. Taylor jokes about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn to the length. Taylor jokes about the whole time about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn to the length.

a quiet, sensitive movie
Some expect a movie à la 8 Mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be at all. This FIlm is mainly "French" - it's also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and brings you to a wine-making experience - if you get into it and don't expect anything from it, which he doesn't want to be at all.
Problematic
Fear like Quench from the 90s, from because of orange, but that doesn't matter either. 5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, but nothing at all. My belly size has grown by 12 cm! Blows like never before! Afterward diarrhoea 5-8 times a day. Little helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhoea has already stayed for 1 week. It is worth noting that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (sorry seen only too late), with the bigger full 5 ? This is very strange!
Fearful stencil and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in a chocolate brown in October, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed that it stinks terribly! However, there was a not too bad result, it came out in about chestnut brown (something dark). Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it, as in the guidance also with not satisfied result, again. This time it was pure waste of time! It did not make any difference, my hair looked like with the first attempt. What was the worst, it still stung weeks after application.. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just didn't disappear.
Very recommended
I am now taking the tablets for a longer time and always taking a tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a longer time because of my work, too little exercise and a longer supplementary illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only through healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 a little bit of the jumps. This also works out in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I feel better and I get better out of bed. The price is also super as you have to remember how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not completely flawless !!! After 3 months of use of the battery case I discovered the following gross defects, which I feel are very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with the mobile phone to "connect" over time. This means that when you remove the phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this creates a new shortage. 2) By removing frequently and re-installing the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn out that it itself dissolves from the case, which is why I would have lost it several times. These are not many gross defects, but I find that a case with battery should function flawlessly and therefore, for the cost of €30, I am very disappointed with the product, especially because I have only used it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I promised myself much more of these cloths it is also really very thin. Since I used it I can no longer exchange it, unfortunately I am disappointed and I can't recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far more than 2 euros.
I'm two-fleet at the frequency response
I bought this loudspeaker for the shower when my smaller free loudspeaker, which I got as an advertising gift, unfortunately broken. Basically, the onforu works great, is water-resistant (mir shcon fell into the shower), gives bass like bass again, Bluetooth works great... suction cup must naturally irrigate, otherwise it dissolves.. he can play sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small loudspeaker. As I say, bass is played as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing are already very quiet, higher and deeper frequencies remain good enough. My old loudspeaker has not played well as bass, but the frequencies were quite natural. At the Onforu, unfortunately,
Very bad
The color was fragmented and if you only went over it with your hand the color dropped off to some. We wanted them to pick them up for free because we didn't want them to have them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense . They would only replace the damaged part but as if both of them were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and remit the money back to us. A LOB to Amazon
Spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Supplied individual parts that you need to stick together. The product was packed in a simple envelope, made of thin cardboard. A few templates were damaged. I did not regret it because I needed this product as a matter of urgency. The included glue hardly holds but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which does not get hard. Even a day after glueing, almost half of the templates from the wood stick are dropped off. You have to pay attention to the fact that not everything sticks with each other. The templates are partly incompletely punched out. For the one-off use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high-quality product.
Don't be unhappy. The closet looks good and is easy to build, even though the instructions aren't so clear. + magnetic closing + beautiful optics + stable when built up + shelf board can be positioned anywhere
- Doors bang through magnets (maybe you can offset with rubber buttons) - some unspoilt spots
- Included dowels are far too small and wobbled (had no others and had them stuck in the house, stuck with craft stickers) - the holders for the inlay floor wobble something (have wrapped up with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If he wouldn't look that good and would have such good dimensions, I'd give fewer stars, as you have to do everything to be really happy, and I find him a little too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes me....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect, I would have forgiven 5*. Sadly, the coffee doesn't run evenly through (if ever!). Even the extra plastic waste (individually packed s.Photo) means a star deductible for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon cashes full score.
Go to the alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and exceedingly loud to it. I couldn't put them quieter either. Probably a defect, supposedly, that's possible. The quietest radio setting was too loud to me, as I think it's already tomorrow. I always woke up when I had turned to the alarm clock with my face because I thought it was already tomorrow. When it is, though, and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright to me. The colours and also the color change I found beautiful, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. Good I also found that he has a battery so that in case of a power outage, the clock and wake-up time don't need to be re-entered. Ging, however, returned for the reasons mentioned.
Light super, processing insufficient
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a version - instead, I laughed at a board at this point... It also lay nothing in the carton. "6 paying - 4 getting" is not a good deal. Definitely Amazon would have determined this as my mistake and I live with it. The light in itself is super. The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated. The light colour is more likely to reach in the direction of cold white. For hallways, workrooms, work room, washbasin, etc. For living rooms, I would grip personally to warmer light. Through with a good old 100 watt bulb, though, I can also get intact specimens corresponding to the order. Should my evaluation be a help, I am happy about a positive review. Questions I try to answer quickly.
Great
I got gestures, and I'd like to share my first look. Yes positive. I've long thought if I order this set, or not. ** The material is stable and it's good in hand. **The soft silicone all scratches expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on pans with coating. **They're heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **You don't relay the heat either and with it can be directly tapped. **The dishwasher, though, sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swipe and they're gone. Finally, I have to say I'm very surprised and I can only recommend
B goods sold as new goods
Amazon Prime shipping simply tip. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked. Here we found that the part has already been installed. The screws/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we saw the part in the sink itself scratch marks / clasp. This part was probably delivered and sent back again. We keep this faucet and build the one in the basement because it doesn't look like it looks. Our conclusion; never again do we order such goods via Amazon but prefer to give a little more in the building market from where we get ordered goods. Find it just sad that customers are so distraught!!!
Product in itself top, external sensor unfortunately broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very happy with this product. The installation was very simple, and the radio range is very good, there are no problems with transmitting from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use the device that seems to have broken the values outside is broken. At the same time, the thermometer seems to be still intact, here they continue to display plausible values. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is well displayed, because it always displays completely astronomical values of the outdoor humidity. This is very damaging, as the device has been mounted outside on a protected spot and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at the delivery stand is still driving under with Hermes through the Republic today, without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service was superb with the triggering of a replacement delivery as always. The mower quickly arrived at me and made a worthwhile impression. The engine is strong and it results in a nice cut. The volume is not just impressively low, but ok. Big manko, unfortunately, is the catching basket. Firstly, it's just dropped up and down from hard plastic and in between fabric. If it's completely just short, then it will naturally be pressed together and parts of the content drop out. What's worse, though, is that the actual practical level gauge is already at half-full of the cut stuff. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower isn't losing from there to big chunks of the cut.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device simply lets you integrate via the app. Very good is the included sensor cable, which can also be extended if needed. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to protect the battery only once to three times a day (adjustable) is displayed in the app. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft back panel of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only quite fuzzyly close again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network. Unfortunately, the device doesn't reconnect itself, even if you put it close to the router. You need to take the batteries out and put it in the vicinity of the router. You need to take the batteries out and put it back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, to this day I still did not manage to level the hotbed properly. The right fixing screw is completely drawn still there the hotbed is still too high and the front right the screw falls almost out because it is not at all attracted, though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that are holding the carriage just as well as the table also. Maybe someone knows what you can do as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do, because so it is impossible to print something out. To the structure: The structure was quite problemless you could only show how to put the cables because you need to relay the cables otherwise, which is very hard. Support I have already written but still not get a response after a week of waiting. Unfortunately, sending back does not go back. I expected a little more.
robust and precise are positively surprised
After many years, my old transducer unfortunately gave up the spirit, so had to produce a new one. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. With this, two batteries are so that you can get started straight away. The packing of the slider is simple, but fully and completely their purpose. Otherwise, the slider does not leave any wishes open and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full score for this and think it holds at least as long as the old gauge. From there there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument just belongs to every household.
Emotional, lasting smell
Didn't buy the armband and once didn't wear it, as it flows out an eerie smell. To this day, this smell hasn't gone away, though it has been permanently "ventilated." After return is no longer possible, I disposed of it. Rate from purchase
For the price ok
The stars and baubles on this cetacean have come to me personally a little too big, so it acts quite massively. The bigger ball is freely moving, which I find very nice again. However, the chain is very easy to process in total, so I have already tossed up the closure twice. So far I have been able to fix it all the time, but I think that will not go/hold well for a long time. But for the cheap price you simply can't wait for anything really high quality.
Very nice jewelery
A beautifully worked bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just need to pull the end through it, it can't go up, amazing! I've rubbed it in with some leather care, making it even softer and tighter. Only: whoever has something magnetic on the arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! Disappointed I was already after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I felt like it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to function: Connects only after some playtime.... Keeps to the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station and re-introduced, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the stations were lying next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, for me, this was not to be used! The thing went back! Would at any rate fry from a purchase, only bring annoyance!
Transport damage
Hello, this garden pump I had once, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner wave had been rusted. I bought it again only for a reason, I desperately needed it because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction pipe as well as the discharge would fit. I hope that the wave at the previous pump had a production fault and the current pump would perform its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the art off housing had torn and the ventilation slits broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I'd recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled cardboard. I kept the pump anyway, as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the artoff housing did not affect the pump power.
If you could think about it better, I thought I was so comfortable when the whole time was running around with a huge key chain. At the beginning everything went pretty well. However, quite quickly the paint goes off and the screws had to always be pulled. A suitable slit screwdriver I didn't find, which couldn't immediately ruin the whole thing. But to get to the most annoyed one to get the whole thing apart. The attachment of the keys to itself is simply a patience, balance and skill play. Ultimately, when I have to mount the screw in the thread and so that the complete thing is unusable. Conclusion: If at all for just once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can buy yourself a cheaper alternative.
Don't quite match the specified dimensions
Lightweight zippers, the material acts robustly and all in feather weight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will actually be able to assess the goods after the first application. In advance I can say that the height is less than stated. At the moment I can already say that the height is less than stated. At the moment I can't really imagine that everything is packed there, for example for a three-week holiday. Emergencyly, the really big parts can be delivered directly into the suitcase - as has so far. Not to mention that not 8, but 10 parts have been delivered, as in the round cosmetic bag there were two smaller bags/bags included. Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention that anyway. That the cosmetic bag has a different shade and consists of other material than the other bags, don't bother me personally. The price-performance ratio I see as a tester price and that's
So lala
So, before Christmas ordered and worked until after Christmas. Now that I wanted to use him again, he didn't do it again. Battery? Exchanged. But he still doesn't. So the money I could have tasted straight into the bin as well.
Care is always good! The application is easy, but you should go very carefully with the brushing to not damage the needle. I could not listen to an improvement of the sound with my very high-quality plate player.
Long battery life
The earphones are wonderfully protected. With this in mind, two black cables were available. The battery life was very long. Definitely perfectly enough sound. I like that the earphones aren't painy even after long wearing and therefore very comfortable. The earcups are totally soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also very small. Purchase recommendation in this price class.
chic dress
Very nice dress, which is good wearable for a wide variety of occasions.. Price-performance is fully consistent here, especially since I got it in the lightning range. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm happy I didn't order it any smaller (whether it was recommended). I just wished that the neckline wouldn't be that deep, and the sleeves could tolerate a little more fabric (if you don't quite have as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Fingers away. Bad things don't. I really and seriously didn't expect such a scrap to be sold nowadays. The drive is run on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It is assumed that the USB ports supply enough power. Nevertheless, a faultless operation of this drive isn't possible. DVD usually goes, Blu-rays are maximally unreliable. The discs usually need to be restarted on multiple occasions, after which it will finally be detected. After minutes you can either restart the computer because it won't get anything or the disc will finally be detected. Then you can either restart the computer because it doesn't get any more or the disc will finally be detected. Then you can either restart the computer because it won't get any more or the disc will finally be detected. Then you can either restart the computer because it won't get any more or the disc
Is what it is supposed to do, but isn't pretty. First of all, I want to emphasise that the two USB ports are actually eyewitnesses, because only the port pointing upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and therefore relatively useless. That's why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and I just needed a sneering extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this in-shaped lump with golden plugs. But from the optics and my misappreciation, the extension fulfils their service very reliably. And by the weight of the plug, the plug-in USB stick doesn't just pee around in the area, as with a very normal extension cord. So no real misbuying, but my euphoria is stuck within tight limits :-).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters that I had to send back could unfortunately not. Practical is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller by BT on the tablet and that the HDMI on the TV. At the same time, the HDMI output is out. I have a PS4 controller by BT on the tablet and that the HDMI on the TV.

A lot of performance
Top device. Led for months without problems. Isn't just light or quiet but brings neat performance. I find the center position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather a little too cool and I'm always on level 2. I've also fallen on the tile floor several times and survived it well. And the simple design I like, too. Competitive products look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference is very large compared to the original but does not make a favourable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We've had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the score is 0.5m accurate. In offline mode, if the dog is in the house, he likes to jump by a few metres, but wouldn't bother. Would buy him again at all times. What would be great, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently, it would last about 1.5h days. Here's a solution super that would create 7-14 days. There's an XL version but unfortunately this one is too big for our taste, so long as the battery doesn't need to last and change daily, we also find impractical. You shouldn't be dealing with the dog with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of rubbish
We've already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem comfortable too. However, the lifespan is diminishing. Although my son wears the shoes only in sports lessons, the sole goes broken already after a few weeks and the shoes can't continue to be used. For the last couple, it was also in normal use that they didn't last very long, but I thought for the lesson it will be enough. Sadly, that wasn't that way. The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately went broken after 5 years so I ordered new ones with joy. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. Comfortable they are just like the ones I had previously owned. At first glance they don't seem to be noticeable either, but at the second glance you realize that the edges are poorly processed and the holding tape at the heel sits quite casually and very probably won't hold for five years like my previous ones. I'm eager!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very sceptical. However, since I would like to go to a festival this year and like to sleep in the car, I have ordered them to be good luck. To the mattress: I tested them in the car (Citroen Berlingo). At the same time, I noticed that there was a bit of a lying-in-cheek and I hope that this one is not back up. The mattress is well-placed and fits super to the festival. The air pump has different adapters. The mattress needs two different adapters that are also to be found at the pump. However, the mattress has different adapters. The mattress needs two different adapters that are also to be found at the pump. So it fits perfectly. The air pump has different adapters, it can fix it and pumped up the mattress in zero Komma Nix. Overall, I am very excited about
Definitely no more than 10€... Sadly the calendar of me only gets two stars. :( 1. For the quick shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn up by the lopsided processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors on it and I had to take more or less my son that it had to take the rest of the parts out so that they had to take the rest of the parts out so that they had to get the parts out. The parts come out more often, which often means that you have to build the car again to bring the parts on. (Mostly the front panel. This one can also be attached very badly.) I would no longer buy this calendar and recommend no further. Perhaps the manufacturers are rethinking the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and do it better. :\
a real drone
I'm thrilled by the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. Inside, the very good ones fly and the 5 min. Flight time is usually completely enough. The hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly I didn't expect otherwise at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, no matter whether tiles or carpet, aren't a problem. For questions of nice contact.
Play ok but only with coercion to Steam. Didn't see when buying that it's not a game CD but just a code to download the game. That would be fine, though, but you're forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is an inshame. Since then, the computer has been hanging up constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a purely installation of the game.
Unfortunately, the battery life fails
I was very happy with the clock. Design and optics great, news etc were easily displayed. Operation folded well.... and yet I send them back. Drr big hooks: the battery and its runtime. Loaded in the evenings, located overnight only on drm cabinet and in the morning 11% less battery in case of non-use. Come on the day a lot of news, the battery was at the end at midday/early afternoon and then you can't even read the time. Therefore, for, not usable. Very bad.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, it's absolutely worth adding a case. Like the Galaxy Buds - so you can only charge if the case is off. Otherwise, it's really chic and well processed !
High-quality case with tank glass foil
Robust case mt a proper tank glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers an all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be raised easily. The material is pleasant in hand and doesn't pollute. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good value for money. This case gives the phone some hold. It's not too bulky and firmly on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.

Persistent cellular microchimerism could play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism arises from the transport of fetal cells through placenta during pregnancy into maternal circulation and their survival due to a broad HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in maternal circulation and fetal cells in the infected skin tissue was detected in the form of Y-chromosome-specific DNA sequences.
The persisting microchimerism could trigger an SSc in certain patients through a fetoantimaternal graft-versus host-like response.

Still disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptomaticism.
In rare cases, however, the disease is only used in adulthood, and it is then referred to as breastfeeding (adult onset still's disease).
The diagnostic criteria include characteristic exanthemum, joint discomfort, fever and leukocytosis, as well as liver function disorders, neck pain without detectable infection, magnification of lymph nodes or spleen, and missing titers for rheumatism or anti-nuclear antibodies.
We report two adult patients who have already had longer illnesses, whose skin appearances led us to the diagnosis of breastfeeding.

The evaluation of melanocyte tumours represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnostics in dermatohistopathology.
Unified and reproducible histological criteria are required for the diagnosis of malignant melanocytary navus or differential diagnostics.
The prognostically relevant and important tumour parameters for the therapeutic procedure must be fully and uniformly recorded for malignant melanomas in histopathological findings.
The recommendations of the working group on histopathological diagnostics in malignant melanomas are summarized below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in vulnerable children pose a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective therapy and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
Infections with a wide range of pathogens are primarily considered, in addition to the usual bacterial pathogens Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegalyviruses (CMV), mushrooms, tuberculosis bacteria and respiratory viruses.
However, in 25-30% of cases, respiratory symptoms are based on non-infectious causes.
Anamnesis, X-rays of the lungs and blood tests are often little helpful for diagnosis.
However, the analysis of material from the airways often results in a diagnosis:
Nasopharyngeal secretion, sputum (possibly induced by cooking salt inhalation) and, above all, bronchoalveolary lava fluid.
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolary lavage results in a diagnostic clarification in 60-80%, the remaining cases must be diagnosed - at the corresponding clinic - by a mostly open lung biopsy.
Most of these women are younger to middle-aged.

We describe a 60-year-old patient with the typical image of an IMDE (type I).

Based on the pre- and postoperative computer tomograms (CT) of 32 patients with unstable, thoracic vertebrate fractures supplied by USS (universal spine system), we performed a planimetric evaluation of the spinal channel.
Our aim was to check the efficiency of direct reposition of stenosing rear edge fragments conducted under intraoperative, sonographic control.
51%) than in cases without neurological disorders (reduction ASP:
Below L 1, the spinal canal is further than between Th 11 and L 1 and thus tolerates a stronger one.
For fractures without neurological failure, fragment reposition promises to avoid late damage to the spinal cord in the sense of myelopathy and Claudicatio spinalis.
A preliminary examination should clarify whether patients with non-radical back pain with serial application indicate ultrasonic analgesia depending on the prescribed power density (LD).
An overview of the existing literal turf shows that intricate and hard-to-responsible lower jaw fractures have a much lower complication rate after compressionosteosynthesis, while simple and low-dislocated fractures in the distal proportion of the mandibula can also be successfully supplied by monocortic mini plateosteosynthesis.
The collection of pre- and intraoperative parameters that describe the character of a lower jaw fracture and additively form a ranking value for the classification of trauma seems to be a sign of an appropriate difference between both therapy concepts.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - so many combinations arise for the description of a lower jaw trauma, that all the studies that have been created so far with their small case numbers can at least allow for a gross difference in indication.
As long as there is no prospective multicentre study that could provide decision-making in the choice of the osteosynthesis procedure, preferable should be given in the flow between "simple" and "difficult" fracture of function-stable compressionosteosynthesis with its much lower incidence of postoperative complications.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic process that enables the comprehensive analysis of a tumour genome on over- and underrepresentations of DNA sections.
In order to make quantitative and reproducible statements about the genetic aberrations, a software has been developed that enables the objective detection of place and type of changes.
The result is shown in the form of a CGH cluster caryogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these investigations is to establish a correlation between the genotype and phenotype based on sum-cardiograms and thus achieve a genetic characterization of tumours, which complements the morphological description.
Operational interventions can be precisely planned and simulated with the help of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the anatomic ankle structures, created from a patient’s tomography data.
Computer-assisted navigation systems or robot systems can provide assistance in the intraoperative implementation of the previously planned and spatial orientation in the surgical situation.
After successful centralization of laboratory analysis for more than 30 years, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurements in undilluminated whole blood and the decrease in laboratory analyses are now and again leading to a new re-decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is performed close to the patient outside central or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of the POCT are faster turn-a-round time (TAT), quicker medical decisions, avoiding sample identification and sample transport problems, and the need for only small sample quantities.
These benefits are often highlighted but do not come with a clearly visible clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of the POCT such as improper handling and/or maintenance of the analysers by the untrained station staff, lack of calibration and/or quality control, the costs of keeping several devices and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation and difficult comparability between the POCT results and routine laboratory results are also apparent.
According to the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should be made only in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory doctors to ensure meaningfulness and high quality of analysis.
Considering the local situation (24 h central laboratory, etc.), the parameter spectrum of the POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The necessary analytes should be:
Haemoglobin or haematocrit, full blood activated, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, ammonia and lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures through MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
Prerequisite is adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety issues.
Rapid and ultra-fast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast agents and thermosensitive contrast agents are discussed.
The spectrum of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation, vascular applications to intraoperative use of MR tomography.
The interventional MR tomography is still at the beginning of development.
MR tomography may be of significant importance in the field of interventional radiology and minimal invasive therapy.
Significant skeleton changes occur in patients with chronic renal impairment.
The aim of the current investigations was to complete the bone mass changes of the spine in long-term haemodialysis of C2 - L5.
Out of 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, spines were completely studied.
With a newly developed preparation technique, the combined two and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed alongside the histological image.
The invertebral heights (SDI), the bone volume (BV/TV) and the intertrabecular link (TBPf) were evaluated quantitatively.
The "spine deformity index" (SDI) shows invertebral fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite a normal trabecular bone volume (BV/TV).
BV/TV shows a distribution known from the skeleton-healthy control collective across the spine.
However, the plateau-like turnaround from the HWS to the LWS is 5% lower at the ROP.
The BV/TV of the 2nd truck is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the measured in the corresponding pelvis comb biopsy.
Cases with longer haemodialysis have higher BV/TV levels regardless of age and gender.
Normal BV/TV is not synonymous with physiological networking of the spongiasa and functional statics.
The three-dimensional analysis at ROP results in a much stronger restructuring of architecture compared to the controls than can be derived from 2-D interfaces and the trabecular bone volumes.
The findings underline the importance of effective prevention to maintain an orderly and thus functional spongiosa architecture in patients with chronic haemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described for the first time a form of groin hernia, which, due to her illness and the sectional findings of Littré herself, did not correspond to the known.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenic explanation for this bagging of the gut wall.
Shortly before, judges described the intestinal wall fracture in a scientific paper on "brokenness" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the "Richter-Littré-Hernie" in the German-speaking area.
On the basis of a case report, the history of this hernia form takes place.
Asperger syndrome is an autistic disorder, the first description of which was made by Hans Asperger in 1944, but which did not pay much attention in the following decades.
It was only in the 80s that the disease became increasingly attention-grabbing and it was only incorporated in 1988 as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 and in 1994 into the DSM-IV.
The cause of the disruption is unknown.
A patient with the typical characteristics of Asperger syndrome is presented, with an epilepsy and internalistic symptoms.
Possible concomitant diseases of Asperger syndrome such as epilepsy will be discussed alongside the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic procedure.
Yersinia infections usually manifest in childhood as feverish gastroenteritis or pseudoappenditis.
A child is reported where Yersinia infection manifested as a localized tumor-shaped lymphadenitis in the mesenterial root with long-lasting resistance.
The position of the diagnosis was achieved by the repeated detection of specific antibodies against various external yersinia membrane proteins.
Only after ciprofloxacin therapy over 16 weeks normalized all clinical findings.
Pulsoximetry in cardiopulmonary reanimation was prospectively studied under 23 preclinical reanimations.
The questions were examined about the conclusions of the O2 saturation values gained under the reanimation and the consequences of these findings.
The analysis shows that the pulsoximetry appears suitable for the quality control of the resuscitation measures carried out in a high percentage.
Pulsoximetry is a useful monitoring measure under reanimation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research of the past 30 years has successfully helped to better understand the etiology and pathogenesis of the sudden infant death (SID).
This also applies if an obduction could not clarify the cause of death.
This workshop presented a wealth of scientific data that highlighted the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year patient, signs of disseminated intravasal clotting with consumption coagulopathy and fever developed in the early postoperative phase after vaginal hysterectomy and the image of a septic shock developed in the early postoperative phase after vaginal hysterectomy.
Staphylococcus epidermidis was also found in this own blood reservoir, in the second propionibacterium acnes.
The source of contamination of the cans was not identifiable.
It is shown that autologist haemotherapy also entails a risk of infection that is not underestimated and the retransfusion of own blood requires severe medical indication.
Mushroom bezoars in the kidney basin are an unusual manifestation of severe infection by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature newborn with VACTERL association that developed after a candidasepsis mushroom bezoare in the kidney basin, which resulted in hydronephrosis with starting postrenal renal failure.
Antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine as well as direct flush with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy led to normalisation of excretion function.
With the increasing frequency of systemic candida infections, especially in neonatology, differential diagnostics for nephrolithiasis should also be thought of the possibility of bezoar formation to initiate early and effective therapy.
High dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method for the treatment of acutely exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
In the meantime, it has become apparent that part of patients do not respond to this therapy or just inadequately.
In this retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 responders and non-Responders were compared.
No significant differences were observed between both groups regarding the following parameters:
Skin type, minimal dose of erythema, single doses and cumulative doses of UVA1, eosinophiles in peripheral blood.
However, non-Responders showed a significantly increased atopia score compared to responders, increased titers of total IgE and specific IgE.
In addition, a strong germination of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and the intestinal with Candida albicans was compared in non-Responders.
These findings show that high dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-Responders are characterised by particularly severe atopies syndrome and complicating superinfections.
The latter findings indicate that a combination of high dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal treatment could be useful for these patients.
The Lupus erythematodes profundus is a rare variant of the Lupus erythematodes.
On the basis of two typical case studies, the association of the Lupus erythematodes profundus with characteristics of the diskoid Lupus erythematodes and the systemic Lupus erythematodes is shown.
Clinically there are subcutaneous knotty and plate-like infiltrates that can lead to ulcerations and scary recoveries.
Histologically, lobular panniculitis is found.
A positive direct immunofluorescence test (Lupusbandtest) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complementary components at the dermo-epidermal border and the vessels is also considered as a further diagnostic indication.
The knowledge of the clinical image and histopathology are particularly important, since the Lupus erythematodes profundus can precede the systemic Lupus erythematodes by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old patient with long-term chloroquine treatment due to rheumatoid arthritis for over 45 years.
The patient died from clinical signs of low-output cardiovascular syndrome as a result of autoptic and toxicological analyses of chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy.
The pathogenesis as well as the morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
In the last 5-7 years, there has been an intense research interest in the mechanisms of the emergence of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatment options for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapy methods is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This thesis summarizes the results of experimental and clinical studies regarding the development of optimal electrodes configurations and shock pulse forms into the internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of scientific progress in medicine, more and more patients with pre-disease, in high age, with ingrained cardiac pump function, after previous heart surgery and in emergency conditions, are undergoing surgery.
This requires a risk-stratification, with which the risk of surgery is divided into "low", "medium" and "high".
Patients, intra- and postoperative patient, structural and treatment factors can be distinguished.
Based on this prediction, the perioperative management of the perioperative course is optimized by individually tailored, pr , intra and postoperative, multiprofessional and interdisciplinary management.
Patients show increased incidence of skin and mucous tumours, including spinaliomas and basaliomas.
We report a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, spinalioma and lymph nodes metastasis of malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of Xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by the complementation analysis, which revealed an allocation to the complementation group D.
Uncommonly, patients with years of untreated, intermittently excerpted malignancies on the chest, thoracic wall and/or abdominal ceiling expose the plastic surgeons to the need for major defects after tumour resection.
With the use of silver-containing active charcoal evlies (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer coatings (Allevyn), an infection could be avoided after flank replacement by an mentum plastic in the context of the resection of an extended basalioma.
After secondary mesh graft coverage, fibrosis and calcification of the mentum also led to a stable wall without the use of plastic nets.
The health reform in Germany in 2000 changes little to the structural deficits of the German healthcare system.
The monopolies of hospitals for inpatient care and the established contract doctors for outpatient care are not affected.
The budgeting of the hospital remains.
In the future, compulsory catalogues for outpatient surgery will be established, which may not be delivered stationary.
The obligation for quality assurance is clarified and reinforced.
A new DRG-based pricing system will be introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to the failure of several organs constitutes a complex immunological process that affects local and systemic proinflammatory stimuli, occurring throughout the system and whose activity reflects only minimally in the volumes of pro and anti-inflammatory agents found in the blood.
On the cellular level, sepsis includes the upregulation of pro and anti-inflammatory activators.
The inflammation is enhanced by the activation of the intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces the synthesis of mRNA encoding for many of the inflammatory intermediaries, including TNF, IL-8 and inducible NO synthesis.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause a parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascades that inhibit the activation of NF-B and minimize the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes seems to control the immune response of the cells, both locally and systemically.
If you characterize this immune response, you may ultimately also understand the determinants of the inflammation response and potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumours are mostly non-specific.
X-rays often only reveal brightenings in the bones, sometimes unified or diffuse radioopacities.
Root tip absorption can be another important finding.
After a short historical demolition, the current state of knowledge will be referenced based on the current WHO classification.
This will then develop the current therapy concept, in which all 22 tumour entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
malignant, locally aggressive, relapsed and non-recurrent tumours.
Generalized hilarious disorder (GHKS) is an often only lately recognized mental disorder, for which a uniformity of mental experience is characteristic of circumstances, as they are usually the cause of depressive mood, desperation, great fear, self-incrimination or other directed aggression.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of the affected person and prevent adverse individual and societal long-term effects.
The acute intriguing meningitis remains a life-threatening condition that requires rapid diagnosis with immediate therapy.
Despite effective bacterial antibiotics, mortality has remained constant for the past 20 years.
Only a regimen targeted at pathogenesis of inflammation is able to minimize neurological consequential damage and maintain the patient's life.
This article presents the current state of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy with special consideration for molecular pathophysiological processes in inflammation of the CNS.
The CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (Dental-CT/ Denta scan) is the method of choice for the radiological investigation of the mandibula and maxilla.
It is particularly helpful in the definition of anatomic lesions.
Therefore, this technique enables a precise evaluation of the complicated details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique enables accurate characterization of pathologies, including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
In the absence of etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), causal treatment is not possible.
Most of the current oral IC therapy studies have not been randomized, double-blind or placebo-controlled, and in so far do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
To date, there is no standard for oral therapy of the IC.
We report on a 39-year-old turkey who developed multiple succulent paps on the back after a heavy sunburn.
Clinic and histopathology show the typical image of disseminated epidermolytic acantate of the skin.
These are benign skin changes and clinically resemble Dyskeratosis follicularis darier, seborrhoic keratoses or plan warts.
Ultrastructural, keratinocytes show premature and faulty cornification.
Epidermolytic acanthans are harmless, acquired skin changes and must be distinguished from severe congenital cornification disorders that show the same histological phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
To reduce intra- and postoperative blood loss, antifibrinolytic agents are frequently used in interventions with extracorporeal circulation (ECZ) in cardioanesthesia.
However, there are also concerns about their potential as triggers of thrombotic complications.
Therefore, the effectiveness of aprotinine and tranexic acid should be compared to fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during heart surgery under ECZ.
The imaging diagnostics of manubriosternal arthritis are described in a 64-year patient as part of psoriasis arthritis.
Synchondrosis sternalis is a rare manifestation of psoriasis arthritis.
The findings of skeleton interest rate, conventional X-ray diagnostics and arthrosonography of manubriosternal arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
Between January 1994 and June 1996, 18 patients were contracted by endophthalmitis at the University Eye Clinic Leipzig.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first patient group of endophthalmitis vitrectomy study.
In this retrospective work, the functional results of surgical treatment should be examined.
Henry Heine experienced the episode of a pseudologa phantastica in his childhood.
The conditional factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this thesis.
The effectiveness and tolerability of sulphasalazin should be examined in the early and late form of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis and the therapy effect depending on the characteristic HLA B27.
The current study shows the history of a patient with severe forced symptoms since the age of 14.
This is not a standalone forced illness, but a schizophrenia masked by forced symptoms.
With the therapy of the exacerbating schizophrenic symptoms with clozapine in the age of 31, neither psychotic symptoms nor significant forced symptoms are found in the one-year catalysis.
While literature increasingly refers to forced symptoms as a side effect of clozapine drugs, the rare case of forced symptoms in schizophrenia is described here as far as the author is known.
The importance of differential diagnostics of forced phenomena for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed in the example of individual cases.
An isomorphic irritant effect (Koebner phenoms) is a disease-specific skin reaction to unspecific skin stimulus.
The triggering of such a Koebner phenomenon in a 32-year psoriasis patient is reported by UVB light testing with thicknesses above 0.055 J/cm2.
Furthermore, the case of a 28-year-old patient is described, in which new psoriasis herds developed in the viral efflorescence after a variety of cells infection.
As the affected person planned to stay abroad for several months in Africa, a detailed history, clinical and laboratory studies were conducted.
The idea was to exclude oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to develop the question of genetic risk factors, and to determine whether rheumatism may occur as a vaccination reaction;
First experiences and results with 13 one-time reconstructions of large complex head-neck defects with 8 microvascular anastomosmized forearm transplants and 5 myokutane pectoralis major insulates are reported.
There was no complete loss of cloth in any case.
With the free forearm transplant, better functional and aesthetic results were achieved, but the surgical times required for reconstruction were relatively long.
Disadvantages of the Pectoralis Major tab are mainly the poor modelability and a limited rotation radius.
It was used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular transplant would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous irritants that can trigger specific inflammatory dermatitis in predisposed individuals.
This typically results in the activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, which is characterized by increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This enables the adhesion of circulating immune cells at the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
While the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been considered as a prerequisite for the emergence of inflammation reactions, recent evidence has shown that exogenous factors can also be put into an inflammatory state without mediating cytokine endothelial cells.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced by chemical or physical stimulus such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, as well as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Endothelial cells are therefore not only subject to the control of woven mediators (cytokines, biogenetic amines, etc.), but can also be directly affected by external skin stimulus in their function.
Therapy-resistant fibrine reactions in the front chamber, particularly after combined cataract/laucoma surgery, constitute an indication of the local dose of rTPA.
We report on our results.
A case of the benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumour of the lymph node described for the first time 5 years ago and not yet documented in German is presented (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph nodes is found almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
In addition to the development of myofibroblastary cells (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin), their diagnostic criteria include the presence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which correspond ultrastructureally to a dense mesh of collagen fibres.
The knowledge of this tumour entity is important for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph nodes neoplasms.
Due to the increased strength of 2 parallel inner rails, obstruction and Kinking could be reduced and a reconstruction of the congestion of the proximal hollow system was achieved.
Furthermore, in addition to the urinary flow within the rails, this technique enables an increased flow between the rails, which is regarded as a crucial mechanism of urine passage for lying urinary conductor rails.
In cases of extrinsic urinary conductor compression, in which the insertion of a singular inner rail cannot achieve sufficient re-education of the ecstasy of the upstream intra and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral inner double-J urinary conductor rails should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication therapy alternative, which may save some patients the insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomie catheter or more invasive measures.
The intradiscal application of Chymopapain is the method with the longest clinical duration and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful attention to the indication and few contraindications - notably allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis enables efficient, low-risk minimal invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
In a prospective study, the value of diurese sonography should be examined compared to diuresis ephrograms ("gold standard") in children with urinary transport disorder.
Microscopic surgery is now an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basalomas.
The method has been developed and modified over the last 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three procedures have the same objective:
radical tumour removal under the care of the uninfested tissue of the surrounding area.
However, they show significant differences in the technique of tumour excision, the attachment of histological cuts and histological preparation assessment.
A methodological inventory is carried out and differences and advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency between primary trauma and malignant transformation is about 30 years.
The "Marjolin Ulcus" is characterised by a more aggressive behavior towards other platelet carcinomas.
In a case of a 65-year-old patient with lesion on the right hand back and regional lymph nodes metastasis, we report the combined radiation and surgical therapy.
The extended soft tissue defect after correspondingly wide local excision was covered with a retrograded A. radialis cloth.
Spinal cord close opioids cause good analgesia in various surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
In this context, less central and systemic adverse reactions occur than in the epidural application of local anaesthesia or parenteral opioids.
The effectiveness of this technique as well as the combination of opioids and local anaesthesia in postoperative pain therapy is shown, also in the context of patient-controlled on-demand analgesia (PCA, "patient controlled analgesia").
The intrathecal application mode is given different advantages over the epidural.
A variety of factors play a part in choosing the opioid.
It seems that the neurotoxicity of the opioids depends on different forms of application.
Concerning the quality of analgesia, serious adverse reactions, the amount of opioid or postoperative lung function, no clinical advantage of thoracic versus lumbal injection results.
There may be evidence that the type of pain therapy has a significant impact on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anaesthesia and/or opioids is the first choice method for patients at high preoperative risk, while also cost-effective.
Through the cooperation of the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) with the information association Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardized epicutitis are centrally recorded in Germany at the centers involved.
For this study, the data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were retrospectively evaluated for 1995 and 1996.
In ascending order, nickel, fragrance mix, Perubalsam and thiomersal showed the most common reactions;
In 1995, differentiated allergen lists were created for defined patient groups (by gender, age, eczema, geographical region, occupation, awareness) and specific questions.
For nickel, fragrance mix and Perubalsam in men, there were less positive reactions compared to females.
Younger patients responded more often to Thiomersal, older to medical externa.
Medical allergens were also frequently positive in patients with leg czech, while hand eczema experienced an increased number of occupational allergens.
For nickel and fragrance blenders, higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens were found compared to the overall population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often unrecognizable.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve the quality of the diagnosis and prevention of contact allergies.
Approximately 95% of people with M. leprosy (in contact) do not open up the disease.
The clinical appearance is not determined so much by the direct effects of bacterial infection as a result of the T cell-mediated immune response.
This overview article takes into account current aspects of epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment and diagnostics of leprosy.
Recently, a large number of studies for quantitative analysis of the Tyndall phenomenon in chamber water (KW) have been presented using laser tyndallometries.
Measurement of the coefficient of diffusion of the BKS compared to the Tyndallintensity in the KW in Uveitiden of different localization should be an example of the extent to which the Tyndall increase is actually caused by BKS disruption.
This experimental study examines the impact of acamprosate, a glutamateric modulator and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E, on the neurological deficit after incomplete cerebral ischaemia and reperfusion in rats.
Attempts to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prosthesis have failed to date.
The use of silicone hoses, polyglycasides, caprolactones and other polyglycaemic substances has not resolved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The strong defensive response against foreigners results in the destruction of the ultrastructured units that are absolutely necessary for the regeneration of the neurites.
Positive animal experiment results do not stand up to a clinical review, as inferior regeneration services may occur in the animal experiment despite a disabled regeneration pathway.
Morbidity due to acute and chronic genital infections and their subsequent effects is the greatest risk of gynecology for HIV-infected women.
Two-thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of urogenital infections, a third a cervical dysplasia.
In a quarter, chronic discomfort and late-term effects of ascending genital infections occurred.
Although the increased incidence of cervix carcinoma (up to 5%) has been incorporated into the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other AIDS-typical opportunistic infections, but usually occurs before actual symptomaticism.
Disorders of menstruation such as amenorrhoea (17%) or hypermenorrhoea were increased.
Pregnancy complications include premature pain (up to 15%), and premature birth, depending on the social structure.
Progression of maternal HIV infection through pregnancy has not been observed.
Risks of peripartial infection on the fetuses include an advanced HIV infection of the mother with high HIV-RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell depletion and birth-related factors such as premature birth, premature woes, amnion infection, duration of bladder jump and woes, and fruit water contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of increased maternal HIV-1 transmission rates can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8 %), by primary low-contamination emperor clearance (4-6 %) and most successfully by primary sectio and concomitant prepartial, intrapartal and postnatal administration of AZT (< 2 %).
Dendritic cells take a central position in the initialization of the immune response because they are the most potent sub-population of the mucosal immune system that can activate T-lymphocytes via MHC receptor.
Initial clinical trials in patients with therapy-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells can be successfully used in vitro with tumour antigens for immunotherapy.
Since rarely basic data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in tumour tissue and their function are known for larynx carcinoma, the current study examined the localization of dendritic cells and other sub-populations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in platelet helium carcinomas of supraglottis and bellows immunohistologically.
The results show that, unlike T-lymphocytes, dendritic cells can be detected especially in the epithelial compartment of platelet carcinomas.
Compared to clinical parameters, patients with low carcinoma dendritic cells (<100/cell/mm2) experienced the lowest postoperative survival time (1 year).
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in Larynx carcinoma constitutes a favourable prognosis factor of the disease.
Increased homocysteine is considered an essential factor in increased arteriosclerosis incidence in patients with chronic renal impairment.
In patients with renal impairment alongside homocysteine, the metabolites of its two degradation pathways transulfurization (education of cystathionin, cysteine) and remethylation (education of methionine, methylmalonate and 2-methylcitrate) were also determined in patients with renal impairment alongside homocysteine.
We report 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This condition is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The suspected diagnosis is based on cat scratches in the anamnesis and the typical findings with lymph nodes swelling in the area of primary lesion.
In order to gain an insight into the frequency and clinic of refrigeration in central Europe, an analysis of patients in a university polio clinic and a skin doctor’s practice was conducted in 1984-94 on the basis of patient records and, in part, follow-up tests.
The incidence of refrigeration was 0.05% afterwards.
Of a total of 56 affected patients (31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The median age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years, the mean duration of illness was 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
46.4% of patients had atopia, 23.2% suffered from other forms of urticaria (cholingeric, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquageneous and heat-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests were positive only in individual cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with mostly moderate symptomatic improvement.
During treatment with antibiotics (penicillin 1-2 million IU/d for 2-4 weeks, n=18 and tetracyclines 2 g/d for 2 weeks, n=10), full remission occurred in 13 patients and improvement was achieved at 8.
Spontaneous remission was observed in 20 symptomatic patients (46.5%).
The surprisingly good treatment results through antibiotic therapy underline the need to further investigate the pathogenesis of this disease, including with a view to a possible infectious cause.
Summary The case of a 56-year-old patient was reported, which was primarily presented with luminbalgia.
Both laboratory, radiological and histopathological, the finding was primarily for the presence of spondylodisitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar body, dorsoventrale stabilization was performed.
In the repeated rehearsal excises, the image of non-specific inflammation was found.
It was not until the biopsy performed as part of the implant removal that a high-quality non-Hodgkin lymphoma was shown.
Chemotherapy was performed in accordance with the CHOP scheme and radiation therapeutic treatment.
Lymphomes of the spine should be taken into account especially in progressive trajectories as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodisitis.
Fragrances of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex (NEO fractures) are associated with central face fractures and/or fractures of the fronto base in over 90% of cases.
Accompanying skull base fractures run through the roof of the ethmoidal cells and lamina cribrosa in up to 70% of cases.
Different concepts exist for the treatment of insulated NEO fractures and combined NEO and skull base fractures in central face fractures.
In the period 1990-1997, 50 patients were treated with insulated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures at the clinic for oral, jaw and facial surgery of the Cantonal Hospital of Lucerne.
For the remaining 25 patients with NEO and middle face fractures without the skull base, the reposition and supply was via a subcranial access path.
47 patients could be monitored and their data evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for extra and transcranial care of fractures of the os ethmoidal with the involvement of the skull base and the center face is presented.
However, she is intra- and postoperatively at a high risk of bleeding.
An adipose 50-year-old patient with familial hypophosphatasia and V. a. phlebothrombosis should undergo surgery.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden drop in endtidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in paCO2 and circular shutdown.
Reanimation measures with heart pressure massage and intravenous administration of adrenaline and orciprenaline were immediately initiated.
Under reanimation conditions, the procedure was terminated with a provisional wound closure and the patient was moved to the intensive care unit.
In V. a. fulminant lung embolism, a systemic Lyse with 100 mg rt-PA was performed with continued heart pressure massage.
After 21/4 hours of cardiopulmonary reanimation and 11/2 hours after the start of the Lyse, moderately stable haemodynamics were achieved with continuous, maximum dose catecholamine gabe and volume substitution.
Massive transfusion was required as a result of Lyse and loss coagulopathy.
On the 28th day after reanimation, the patient could be moved from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis "Lungemboly" was performed by the clinic, capnometry, blood gas analysis and ECG.
Due to the emergency situation with continuous reanimation, further diagnostic procedures were waived.
In anaesthesia with the new inhalation anaesthesia Sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total amount is metabolized.
The extent of the resulting serum peak values of inorganic fluoride determines, among other things, the hepatic defluoride rate, the total amount of anaesthesia administered and the solubility of the narcose gas expressed by its blood gas distribution coefficients.
In a large number of experimental and clinical trials, the question was examined as to whether the fluoride load of sevoflurane could lead to increased renal complications.
However, neither in the animal experiment, nor in routine clinical use or in protracted narcosis duration, nor in use in cute patients with renal impairment, an increased renal hazard potential for fluoride exposure to sevoflurane was shown.
The recently detected low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane - unlike enfluenza and especially methoxyflurane - is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold for 50 μmol/l of fluoridine-induced nephrotoxicity has been derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane, but has no validity in connection with the narcose gases sevoflurane but also enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those encountered with sevoflurane after anaesthesia, are classified as clinically safe.
There are no experimental or clinical evidence of direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
The choice of macroscopic preparation method is fundamental for the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease.
The best results provide the baseline of the cardiovascular ventriculars to be performed after fixation and the quarking of the additionally decalculated coronary arteries, even though no postmortal coronation can precede.
In this procedure, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial crowns, length, circulation and transmural extension of infarctions, their age and consequential conditions can be better recorded and assigned to the corresponding coronary supply area than the traditional opening of the unfixed heart that follows the blood stream.
The coronatrics assess the degree and extension of atherosclerotic stenoses, plaque haemorrhages, parietal and ocular thromboses as well as therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty and bypass surgery.
This is particularly important in acute heart death and only short-lived territorial ivory.
By systematically removing transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can also be recorded in correlation with coronary morphology and coronary supply.
However, more prospective randomized studies show that adjuvant postoperative irradiation or chemotherapy do not provide an additional advantage for survival after R0 resection.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy are not yet conclusive in both the platelet helpcarcinoma of the oesophagus and the adenocarcinoma of the distal dining tube, oesophagogastral transition and stomach.
In patients with potentially resective tumours, several Phase III studies did not show a convincing prognosis of preoperative radiatio, chemotherapy or combined radio/chemotherapy compared to sole resection.
However, a survival advantage with this multimodal approach is only expected when responding to pre-treatment and subsequent complete tumour resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy, combined radio/chemotherapy improves the response rate at least in the platelet heel carcinoma of the oesophagus, but also results in increased postoperative morbidity and lethality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be carried out as part of prospective studies in rigorously selected patients in specialised centers with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This condition is usually associated with certain metabolic diseases.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or "hysterical" symptom formations become comprehensible as processing traumatic childhood and youth experiences such as abuse or mistreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization and personification of only good and poor objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Non-assimilable memories of traumas act as traumatic and must be deterred, for example by eating disorders, substance abusus, self-injuring behavior or social "acting".
On this psychodynamic background, we represent trauma therapy that implements the experiences of hypnotherapy and catathym-imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparatory phase, a safe inner place and contact with inner aides is created in the imagination.
The actual traumatic work consists of a dossier, stable, but as little retraumatic approach to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner comfort and aversion.
In the final phase, the focus is again on the resource-oriented shift towards creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record developments at a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the last 20 years regarding diagnoses and the proportion of multi-disabled people.
Chronic, naming intracranial hypertension may have multiple causes.
In addition to the undisclosed occurrence in adolescent young women ("Pseudotumor cerebri"), venous drain disability is possible as a cause.
The extent to which visus remains stable in the long term after vitrectomy in diabetic retinopathy and the causes and risk factors for deteriorating visus have been studied.
HIV is easy to inactivate by most disinfectants.
The human-infectious dose is about 100 to 1,000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the entrance gate.
After inoculation, HIV may have started after 24 hours, and HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibodies tests show that the aging HIV infection can be detected within four to 12 weeks, the antibody response has been mitigated with therapy;
Nucleic acid testing results in the detection of approximately the eleventh day.
In a nearly 100-year development, countless body, body and synthetic tissues were used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favored autologist tissues, the central Patellar tendon tract, a quadruple tendon transplant of the pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus/M. gracilis) and a central quadricepse tendon transplant have the greatest clinical significance.
With some restrictions, the use of body transplants is also justified.
The individual transplants show specific differences in biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical trials, a clear superiority of one of these transplants could not be verified.
The different anatomic and functional requirements of the front and rear cruciate cruciate can be taken into account when choosing transplantation.
In the supply of complex band injuries and revision cases, careful, preoperative planning with modified graft selection is required.
The rare occurrence of myoepithelial carcinoma is presented in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary gland of the mouth mucous membrane.
Over the course of 2 and 5 years, a large recurrence tumour developed in the area of the left mouth angle 2 times.
Histological treatment showed a myoepitheliar carcinoma of the small salivary glands, proportions of a pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be shown.
The clinic, diagnostics, therapy and histological characteristics are discussed taking into account literature.
Coronary lime is a reference to an arteriosclerotic process and can be captured very closely with electron beam tomography.
The clinical priority varies depending on whether limescreening is performed in patients with already known coronary heart disease or asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Mutual myocardialemia is a clinically important part of coronary heart disease.
This thesis presents frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects, in terms of ergometry, as well as indications for predictive evaluation and results for practice.
We report 3 patients with a combination of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purple (ITP) and diabetes mellitus type I (IDDM) and prediabetes.
In the 3 patients, the two illnesses occurred as part of type II autoimmune polyene dokrinopathy.
However, we did not observe a case of ITP among about 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
Patients with chronic immunorombocytopenic purple and type I diabetes should therefore be excluded from the formulation of type II autoimmune polyene dokrinopathy.
Safeguarding the airway after surgery in the upper airway may be problematic in certain patients.
It is therefore important to ensure safe reintubation in case of need.
Two patients with significant intubation difficulties and thus high risk factors for intubation and, where appropriate, reintubation in general anaesthesia are reported.
A fiber optically plazed endotracheal guide wire served as post or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both the CT and MRI are essential additional tests for diagnostics and stage classification of larynx tumours.
A very accurate knowledge of the submucosal propagation pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumour infiltration and their consequences for stage classification and therapy are essential for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both the CT and MRI are highly sensitive investigations for the detection of the neoplastic infiltration of the pre-epiglottic space, paraglotical space, subglot and cartilage.
However, the specificity is less high with both methods than initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumour spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two pruning processes is important from a clinical point of view because it enables the exclusion of neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucose tumours, both CT and MRI provide valuable indications of possible etiology, the extent of submucose growth and the appropriate biopsy site.
The implantation of cardiovascular defibrillators (ICD) reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with terminal renal impairment have an increased incidence of coronary heart disease.
Myocardial revascularization through PTCA in chronically dialysis-related patients has limited case numbers that suggest a high periinterventional complication rate and a high residual rate.
We studied the remnant rate in 23 patients with terminal renal impairment (17 men, 6 women, medium age:
52.5 +/- 18.3 years).
After primarily successful PTCA, recoronarangiography was performed in all patients within 6-12 months.
Prior to angiographic control, 12 patients complained of the recurrence of pektanginous discomfort.
Laboratory chemistry showed hypertriglyzerideemia (265 +/- 160 mg/dl) and hypercholesterolemia (258 +/- 53 mg/dl) with low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/dl) with a significant increase in fibrinogen concentration (481 +/- 114 mg/dl).
The case of a 64-year-old patient in which the pelvis was completely instable as a result of increased fatigue fractures of the front and rear pelvis ring within a year.
As a triggering event, a bagatelltrauma was retrospectively adopted for the pelvis area.
Due to the X-ray morphology of the multiple pseudoarthroses, differential diagnostics initially focused on the suspicion of a malignant occurrence.
For hip pain in childhood, a wide range of different illnesses is considered.
The non-traumatic causes are focused on differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, history, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed to avoid unnecessary investigations and not miss the necessary therapeutic steps.
Examples show some common but also rarer symptoms.
The iatrogeneous breakdown of the trochanter major in the prosthetic supply of the thigh fracture seems to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bones of the frequently old patients and the maximum inner rotation of the leg during prosthesis implantation from so-called "back access" could be predisposing.
In the few sources of literature, early-functional conservative treatment is recommended for the insulated and used here for comparison, even in the case of significant fragmentation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care remains controversially discussed.
This thesis represents the role of the construct in the interaction between effectiveness, economics and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of various patient satisfaction measurement procedures, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are examined using quality assurance data.
Based on the ZUF-8, relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, patients’ further use and therapeutic work relations are examined.
This shows that the relationship between treatment results and satisfaction is not particularly large.
Unhappy patients differ in further use behavior.
The relationship between satisfaction and the therapeutic work relationship is partly clear for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The effects found are relatively large but absolutely small.
This is mainly because very few patients express discontent after their treatment.
Changes in the man's ageing process are similar to changes in younger, hypogonal men.
Although the testosterone level decreases in average with age, correlations between median and higher age and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is related, among other things, to methodological limitations of current studies, the high variability of testosterone levels in old age, unclear reference values for older men and various influences (health status and behavior) on testosterone levels.
A 68-year-old patient with dyspnoea for five days has undergone a sonography prior to scheduled Lyse therapy after nucleic medical indication of lung embolism in stage II-III.
A right-wing thrombus was found.
In the event of acute vital hazard, ultra-high dose streptokinase short-term lysis (UHSK) with 9.000,000 units of Streptokinase was initiated for 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely dissolved and the thrombosis of the leg largely dissolved.
The treated patients were predominantly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 and were mostly injured in traffic accidents.
In 50% of patients, a single fracture was detected, the remaining patients had either companion injuries or polydreams.
Hospitalization duration was an average of 17 days and the use of crutches averaged 21 weeks, which speaks for a relatively rapid healing process.
The majority (85%) were treated without complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in patients with open fractures in 9 (1.8%) and patients with closed fractures in just 2 cases (0.4%), which is within the normal norms.
Based on our findings and experience, we believe that the treatment of fractures of the femur diaphysis with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and has comparative results compared to other treatment methods.
The scope of remote metastasis diagnostics in head-neck tumours remains controversially discussed.
In the present retrospective study, 1087 patients with primary platelet carcinomas of the upper aerodigestival tract were examined, which factors affect the frequency and localization of remote metastasis.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with remote metastasis during lifetimes, including 17 times (1.6%) at the time of primary tumour diagnosis.
The distance metastasis rate correlated positively with the initial tumour stage (p<0,00001) and with the manifestation of a local and/or regional recurrence (p<0,00001) or a second tumour outside the ENT range (p<0,0005).
However, the parameters 'primary tumour localization' and 'histopathological tumour grading' did not have a standalone prediction value but reflected substantially different frequency of the tumour stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, remote metastasis in tumours of categories T1-3 N0 may be limited to an X-ray examination of the Thorax.
Further diagnostics, consisting of abdominal sonography, skeleton interest rate and/or computer tomography (CT) of the Thorax, are indicated in locoregionary advanced tumours, relapses and second tumours outside the ENT range.
However, you should always ask yourself about the therapeutic consequences in individual cases.
This article provides a short overview of the history of spinal surgery from the late 19th century to our time.
Ernst Simmel belonged to a small circle of early psychoanalysts who sought to use psychoanalytical principles in medicine with great enthusiasm and in "productive orthodoxy".
Consequently, he is the founder of a first psychoanalytic polio clinic in Berlin in 1919 and a first psychoanalytical hospital ("Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") in 1927 in Germany.
Discovering him as a pioneer can also be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of various historical divisions of the specialist societies.
He is a credible professional identification figure across generations, especially for the new specialist for "psychotic therapeutic medicine".
Nevertheless, the emphasis on Simmel should not lead to the fact that the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine, who had to leave Germany forcibly due to their Jewish ancestry, will no longer be properly thought about.
In principle, 4 post-traumatic states of proximal femur can be affected by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip luxuries and subluxes, femur head crowns, pseudodarthroses, deformities.
The clinical, clear and computer-tomographic/sonographic analysis of leg geometry is a central priority here.
With the diversity and complexity of post-traumatic states of the proximal femur, only a perfect tailor-made solution can be the answer to a very individual problem.
The aim of the study was to metaanalyze all available randomized, controlled studies in which dexamethasone was used alone or in combination with other anti-ethetics for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative phase (PONV).
Skleritis and episculitis may occur in the context of numerous systemic diseases.
In certain cases, subjective symptoms and visibly threatening complications can only be addressed by systemic immunosuppression in the long term.
Movement disorders of the vertebrae lead to unilateral compression and rotation of the disc.
Since the disc incident occurs in more than 80% of cases on the side of compression, a causal connection must be assumed.
As this disruption also reduces the foramen intervertebrale, the room need becomes even bigger in the band disk incident.
Treatment of the disorder should be recommended.
This surgery, developed for the malignant changes in the pancreatic head, is very extensive and strained with high perioperative morbidity and lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the more organ-saving duodenum-sustaining pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for naming tumours of the pancreatic head.
This surgery could be performed blood-saving and almost uncomplicated in patients.
For a follow-up period in the median of 3 years, 6 in 7 patients were trouble-free, and in a patient undergoing surgery due to a hostrinoma, late postoperatively increased Gastrin levels were detected.
Compared to the preoperative function test, the endocrine and exocrine function was only slightly affected by surgery.
In the case of strict indications, suitable tumours in the area of the pancreatic head can therefore be treated adequately, adequately radically, low-complication and without continuous limitation of exo and endocrine functions.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable procedure in the treatment of symptomatic and/or prognostic bradycardic heart rhythm disorders.
Approximately one in six patients die of a sudden heart death after pacemaker implantation, which is largely attributed to progression of pre-existing cardiovascular disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become apparent that permanent electrostimulation of the heart may present the danger of triggering and/or aggravating life-threatening ventricular heart rhythm disorders.
Especially in the case of advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-related R-on-T phenomena, short-length sequences and perception defects, e.g. during ventricular arrhythmias or transitory myocardialemia, stimulation-related secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias may trigger, for example, ventricular arrhythmias or transitory myocardialemia.
Given that such steps-related events are a preventable cause of sudden heart death, an improved understanding of the patho mechanisms involved and a corresponding awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy more reliable and, above all, safer for patients.
Staging, i.e. the determination of the extension of the disease, is used to select patients suitable for curative surgical therapy or to define those carcinoma carriers who do not benefit from surgical intervention and are supplied with alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy).
Computer tomography (CT) of the thorax (including liver and adrenal cord), the sonography of the upper jaw and skeleton interest rategraphy are standard radiological tests for the staging of bronchial carcinoma.
For targeted questions, e.g. after Thorax wall infiltration, and in patients with contrast median allergy, magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) can be performed in addition or alternatively to a CT.
Nuclear medical techniques such as positron emission tomography with [18F]2-Flouro-2-Desoxy-D-Glucose (FDG-PET) to assess lymph nodes and remote metastases, in-111-octreotides/somatostatin scans for staging/diagnostics of small cell lung cancer, and Thallium-201 SPECT, which is currently evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly used for staging lung tumours.
Methods that are currently being tested in experimental studies, such as genetically molecular MRI contrast agents or tumour receptor-based nuclei-based methods could play an important role in the staging of bronchial cancer in the future.
After tumour surgery in the abdominal room, retroperitoneum and small pelvis, the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs may be damaged.
Since these are often patients of sexually active and also reproductive age, the prevention of such accompanying symptoms is particularly important in tumour therapy.
Impairment of erection or disorders of ejaculation may occur after surgical, radiation therapeutic or drug therapy of various tumours.
Through in-depth understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now avoidable in a high percentage.
If damage to the corresponding nerves due to the required radicality of surgical intervention in order to curatively treat the tumour disease cannot be avoided, sexual dysfunctions for these patients in sexually active and also reproductive age are a significant restriction of quality of life.
However, both ejaculation disorders and erection disorders can be treated through a number of therapy modalities in almost all cases.
Arteria subclavia is increasingly used for arterial canulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known about the perfusion characteristics of the neck vessels at different cannulation locations.
Atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been reported by a truck driver following both legs’ swelling trauma, which has developed an atypical hepar-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) under drug-related thrombotic prophylaxis with ungrouped heparin;
In addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with thrombocyte increase in positive antibodies against heparin:
During our first patient contact on day 6 after the accident, a deep leg vein enthrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and an impending compartmental syndrome was also surgically split on the left thigh.
After the exclusion of any other causes of these reactions, antibodies against heparin (heparin pale factor 4 complex evidence) could be detected 2 days later.
Immediately after flushing intravenous access with less than 50 IE of an ungrouped heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed the full picture of anaphylactic response that could be immediately broken by cortisone.
We post that the thrombocytopenia, otherwise known as HIT, is just one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen antibody reaction to heparin, which occurs on the cell surface of thrombocytes.
Accordingly, a proposal for a new classification of the different forms of heparinallergy type I-IV is made.
Types I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without thrombocyte loss and type IV the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
Basalzelladenocarcinoma was incorporated in 1991 as an entity in the 2nd edition of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Ellis & Wiskovitch (1990) of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumour entity accounts for about 2.9% of all malignant tumours of the salivary gland.
The Gl. parotis is the seat of this tumour in 90% of cases.
Enoral manifestations are described only as casuistics;
The case presented here concerns a middle-aged woman with a basalt store carcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists of surgical tumour exertion with sufficient safety clearance and histologically controlled tumour clearance of all resective margins.
Basalzelladenocarcinoma is presently known to have a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenic metastasis rate of 10% occurring up to 10 years after the first manife station.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In this thesis, a modified animal experiment model of renal xenotransplantation was developed, in which the course of a hyperacute repellent reaction is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pigs were planted as donor organs on Wistar rats as recipient animals, with end-to-sea vessels anastomos with donorta, or V. cava and urinary conductor drainage used for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of the present study was to analyse the protective effect of complement modulation with the help of the soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) for renal toxicotransplants.
A total of 24 xenotransplantations were performed and randomized with 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group), or 50 mg/kg sCR1 as 3-ml bolus (treatment group).
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in extending the transplantation survival period (from 10.5 +/-2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complementarity was detected in the sCR1 group, which is due to a modulation effect of sCR1.
As early as 10 min after the start of reperfusion, histologically, thrombocyte groups, fibrin deposits in capillaries and interstitial infiltrates were shown in the control group.
However, the renal transplants treated with sCR1 had a significantly reduced intravascular thrombin formation and lower interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistological study detected an equally reduced deposit of C3 in the glomeruli and in the interstitium in the therapy group.
Up to now, 52 laparoscopic interventions on the gallbladder, stomach, thick intestine and groin fracture have been performed in our house with the robotic arm controlled by the surgeon’s voice for optics guidance.
The field of view is determined directly by commands of the surgeon.
In all interventions, the control of the robotic arm was accurate, speech recognition accurate and without technical problems.
29 interventions could be performed by an surgeon alone as "solo surgery".
In addition to the surgeon, there was only one assistant.
The robot can be easily and successfully used by any surgeon and in any surgical room.
Explaining vascular complications by the DSA in kidney and pancreatic transplants requires invasive intervention in mostly diabetic pre-damaged vessels, and the use of iodine-containing contrast agents can show nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitids should be included in differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated by a case of Coxitis tuberculosa, which has been treated with the Minden clinic in collaboration with the accident surgeons.
A differentiated diagnostic approach with imaging and microbiological methods enables a targeted planning and execution of combined therapy from surgical endoprothetic hip joint replacement and anti-tuberculous chemotherapy.
After critical evaluation of the outcome of the therapy and discussion of literature, the presented approach is successful, both the local remediation of the infection and the functional outcome.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly decrease quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive investigations.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
The electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the procedure.
More recent measurements of atria transmembrane potential through modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization that promote an interruption of wave fronts underlying the atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion seem similar to ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are necessary to assess whether cardioversion mechanisms differ from those with acute atrial fibrillation in chronic atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications in Klavikula fractures are rare.
They occur as primary lesions, more often as secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive calory formation with a costoclavular space.
Kasuist is reported to have observed a late lesion of the Plexus brachialis as a result of a Klavikula fracture with pseudodarthrosis and overshooting calus formation.
Diabetes mellitus type I is one of the autoimmune diseases and does not rarely occur together with other autoimmune diseases.
The subject of our investigations was the co-incidence of coeliac disease and type I diabetes at the University of Dresden’s Children’s Hospital.
A granulomatous inflammation reaction is reported after the use of absorbable interference screws for fixing a Patellar tendon transplant in front of the cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate cruciate.
Radiologically, osteolysis was shown in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was sterile inflammation with evidence of foreign body giant cells.
Primozymes of the kidney represent a grotesque rarite.
To date, only 6 clinical trials have been described in literature.
A 64-year-old patient is presented, in which an surgical renal tumour was histologically shown to be plasmozyme.
In this case, the procedure is discussed.
For multiple myeloma with renal participation, nephrectomy is indicated only in renal complications.
The predictive importance of primrose renal participation by the plasmocytome is unclear.
Within the framework of a multicentre, prospective, clinical study from 17 German clinics, 646 documented distal radius fractures of the adult were selected for a treatment indication corresponding to the fracture type or a suitable therapy procedure.
The success of primary treatment was evaluated by creating a practice-related score.
So far, numerous genosomes and acquired skin diseases are known to follow the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
In 1992, Moulin et al.
[40] 5 patients with acquired strip-shaped, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he identified as a new entity.
We report on another patient with this dermatosis.
The essential criteria are strip-shaped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without inflammatory pre-stage and without later sclerosis or other anomalies.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
We suggest the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this condition.
It includes rules of conduct and to improve the muscular situation, a special exercise program that can also be performed safely as home training.
In a group lesson, coordination improvement and joint conservation are trained by exercising simple movement processes and basic knowledge of anatomy, arthritis creation and knee-friendly and unburdening behavior is conveyed.
The efficiency of the "Knieschule" as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrose was demonstrated in a prospective randomized investigation.
The correct alignment and size of the implants is of outstanding importance for the successful and lasting knee joint replacement.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are shown.
In the context of the obtaining glaucoma study, the blue-on-yellowVEP proved suitable for the separation of secured patients from secure controls.
In the context of a retrospective analysis of air rescue, the primary out-of-clinic care for 274 acutely injured (58%) and (42%) children up to the age of 14 were examined with regard to the temporal occurrence of the interventions, the observance of the aid period, the age and gender distribution, the severity, the causes of trauma and patterns of injury, the type of acute paediatric disease, the pre-hospital emergency diagnosis and therapy as well as the means of transport and the target clinic on the basis of emergency medical documentation.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Orthopaedic University Clinic Mainz has reviewed the signs of low-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with increasing age but also with sick processes.
As a basis for the interpretation of patient tests for diseases of the haematopoietic system, the age and gender-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow area were analyzed in the context of the present study in subjects.
Treatment control is not currently possible for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular condition due to atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, patients without actual recurrence may sometimes be exposed to an antiarrhythmic regimen and thus the risk of proarrhythmic adverse reactions.
Forcing the P wave analysis under sinus rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
P-wave triggering must be carried out, P-wave filtering must be conducted bidirectionally or with an FIR filter.
Standardization of the method is urgently desirable.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in the P-wave duration of patients without this rhythm disorder.
Sotalol as a Class III antiarrhythmia does not affect the P wavelength, but the spectral analysis of the P wave is significantly different.
In summary, the signaling of the P wave enables the identification of patients with a high probability of intermittent atrial fibrillation after optimizing the method.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities to human choriretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
The prerequisite for efficient pain therapy is the knowledge of pain genesis.
For most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nozizeptors are activated and the nozizeptive afferents are guided through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain causes injury to the nervous system.
Central awareness mechanisms at the spinal cord level and the participation of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to chronicisation of such pains.
The therapy of nocetic and neuropathic pain is presented using treatment algorithms.
In addition to traditional non-opioidanal agents, coanalgesics and opioids are particularly important for chronic pain.
The regulation of these substances must respect defined pain therapeutic standards.
Blockages with local anaesthesia as monotherapy of chronic pain are now obsolete.
In the case of post-traumatic pain, however, a defined series of peripheral nerve blockages or trigger point infiltrations can make sense as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathic blockages are particularly important in the diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic pain (SMP).
The importance of irradiation of the pelvine lymphocystically positive prostate carcinoma is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific questions are not available or are methodically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In the case of T3/4 carcinomas, the additional irradiation of paraaortal lymphocytes compared to the sole irradiation of the pelvine lymph nodes does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumor-specific survival and is obsolete.
Data on long-term adverse reactions are only available from studies with outdated radiation technology.
The radiation therapy of the lymphocyte-positive prostate carcinoma is not a standard therapy but an individual decision and should be performed as part of studies (e.g. ARO 95-3).
Due to the ambiguity of the clinical picture, the pathomorphological examination enables a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication position for the appendectomy.
The pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as their special forms are presented below and the importance of neurogenetic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is highlighted in particular.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by acronymous pointing of the pleura can usually be provided with a thin-calibre drainage.
On the other hand, a large-calibre blue drain is shown in a complicated pneumothorax.
The often acutely life-threatening tension spneumothorax with its typical clinic, e.g. in ventilators, must be immediately relieved before further diagnosis.
A haematothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be quickly provided with a blue-drainage due to the danger of severe blood loss and, if necessary, surgically provided.
A spontaneous haematothorax also requires drainage and internalistic explanation.
The doctor at an internist intensive care unit must master the diagnostics and therapy of pneumo and haematothorax.
The questioning of this prospective individual case observational study in 12 intensive care patients was whether routine identification of procalcitonin (PCT) in intensive care patients brings additional information about clinical findings, routine laboratory investigations, microbiology and radiology.
Likewise, lethality, overall injury, the likelihood of bleeding complications and the proportion of pelvine companion injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvis injuries, i.e. pelvis injury with concomitant peripelvine soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvis injuries with ipsilateral fracture of the femur (floating hip) constitute a particular situation.
The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the care of organ lesions is the focus of interdisciplinary therapy here.
Acetabulum fractures are a particular challenge as joint fractures.
Operational therapy with anatomic joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long-term results.
As the number of additional pathologies increases, the long-term outcome deteriorates.
The primary accidental cartilage damage seems to have a significant impact on the long-term outcome after acetabulum fractures.
An insulated calcifying arteriosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aorta caused typical symptoms in a 56-year-old patient as with aortic thoracic stenosis.
Noteable in the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descensing thoracic aorta and the extent of the calcifications.
The baseline findings of angiography and computer tomography (CT) of the Thorax had differential-diagnostic thinking of a calculating aortic tumour, a secondary calcified wall dissection or an expired aorticitis.
The retinal pigment epithet (RPE) regulates lipid metabolism of photoreceptors by catalyzing outer segments and is exposed to the regulation of blood lipids through vein skin perfusion.
As cholesterol and phospholipids are absorbed through specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, expression and regulation of these receptor types were studied in the RPE.
With regard to the change in educational and social structures, medical habilitation as an academic qualification has also recently been questioned.
In the discourse on the application and developments of reproductive techniques, the experience aspects of the affected persons step into the background.
Help outside medical treatment is only requested by many at a time when they are exhausted or very disappointed by the unsuccessful treatment attempts.
The skeleton is among the most common metastases in metastatic mamma, prostate and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic therapy procedures depends on histology, the detection of extraskeletal metastasis and the general condition of the patient.
Hormonal therapy is the first choice for receptor-positive mamma carcinoma and prostate cancer.
Chemotherapy is indicated in receptive mamma carcinoma, after failure of hormone therapy or in the detection of liver metastasis.
In small cell bronchial carcinomas, chemotherapy should be performed.
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers are accessible to radiojod therapy.
For metastatic non-small cell bronchial carcinomas or renal cell carcinomas, the indication for systemic therapy is rather restrained and limited to younger patients and patients in sufficiently good general conditions.
There are difficulties in imaging the response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for the determination of bone degrading products in urine could prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and therapy of childish back pain with radial symptoms or nerve strain pain should be examined.
The risk of infecting yourself with HIV is subjectively often considered big.
This attitude recognises the fact that other viral illnesses are much more common and also more contagious.
Hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prevention.
Another important measure is vaccination, for example, there is a clear recommendation on hepatitis B vaccination for hospital staff.
In the event of injury with HBV-containing material, a combined active and passive vaccination is carried out post-expositionally.
There is no drug-related post-exposition prevention for hepatitis C.
Early therapy with interferon with evidence of HCV-RNA seems to have a high success rate.
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis was diagnosed in a 26-year-old woman in preparations for a video-thoracic obtained lung biopsy.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-handed renal tumour had been removed and diagnosed as angiomyolipom.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strong positive reactions in both the muscularly differentiated tissues of the angiomyolipom and the smooth muscle proliferates of the lungs.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of asymptomatic intracerebrales, up to 5 cm in diameter, in the left frontal brain.
Polytopic organmanifestations and histomorphological findings of significant mesenchymal new formations in the kidney, lungs and probably also in the brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberculosis.
The international discussion on death aid issues, as well as development in Australia and Oregon, points to an increasing tendency to give medical aid to suicidal aid preferable to active killings - not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on the suicidal aid of a psychiatrist dated 1994 gives reason to investigate this issue from a psychiatric perspective.
Nitrogen oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (bNOS and ecNOS) were studied in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate agents.
Both the NADPH-diaphorase (d) reaction and immunohistochemical showed a differentiated nitriner innervation of the prostatic gland, the electricity and the vessels.
In the preparations with obstructive hyperplasia, there seems to be a pronounced reduction in nitriner innervation, with no quantitative evaluation yet due to the small number of preparations.
In the area of the endothelium, differentiated expression of the NOS, depending on the vascular section, was also shown by the NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemical.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed in the area of glandular epithelium with the specific antibodies immunohistochemically.
The distribution of NO synthases indicates a high importance of nitrogen oxide in the regulation of smooth muscles, regional circulation and secretion of normal and hyperplastic prostates.
Due to heterogeneous patient groups and diverse Ileus causes, surgical indication and surgical choice in thindarmileus is difficult to standardize.
A unified approach to the intraoperative handling of the intestine (striping, insertion of a bowel rail) and the abdominal cover (technique, seam material) would be desirable.
Adhesion remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgery techniques of thin palpitations continue to be used (in the case of a relevant minority of clinics), with the surgery after Noble largely replaced by the plikature after child phillips and their variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no secured indications or contraindications for plikatures or for long probes and other surgical measures.
Given the frequency and socioeconomic importance of the thindarmileus, it remains an important task for the future to change this.
The public's call for information and transparency in the highly sensitive area of human reproductive medicine seems more than justifiable.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results achieved by reproductive medicine and their public discussion can allow to increase their social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment, while avoiding misunderstandings.
Furthermore, such an analysis is a valuable tool for reliable advice to the affected couples.
Gang characteristics and reduced muscle strength of depressive individuals were often described in clinical literature, but so far hardly empirically studied.
We collected various aisle and force parameters using simple and standardized procedures within a theoretical framework, which is based largely on traditional clinical observations of depression.
20 hospitalized, depressive individuals were examined and compared to 20 healthy subjects using standardized isometric force tests and aisle analyses that record step length, average walking speed, maximum walking speed and 3-min walk.
The examination was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement in symptomaticism.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy were shown in particular in knee and elbow extension and also in all the gait parameters examined.
The methods used for the first time in psychiatric questions in the context of the current pilot study are suitable for reliable and low stress analysis of relationships between depression and motortics and can therefore be used in broader studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxe lens.
There may be an acute glaucomania in the sense of a cylindrical block or chronic glaucoma.
A YAG iridotomie or basal isitectomy rarely results in pressure regulation.
We report the results after cataract surgery at Subluxatio lentis and Glaukom.
In 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS), the impact of autogenic exercise (AT) on the plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide was studied.
Compared to healthy controls (N), scleroderma patients had significantly increased levels of substance P plasma (x +/- s):
PS patients 7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol/l, N 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/l).
The VIP plasma concentrations, apart from specific variations, showed no substantial differences in standard values (x +/- s:
PS patients 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/l, N 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol/l).
We describe 2 unrelated, German, male patients with typical symptoms.
Both showed progressive neurodegradation up to the age of 3.2 and 4 years respectively, severe mental retardation, signs of dysostosis multiplex and memory phenomena in lymphocytes.
The -L-Fukosi- that activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was greatly reduced (<3% of the normal value).
Until now, the mutation G401X has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombes in the right forecourt are a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculo-atrial shunt systems.
We report a 4.6-year-old girl who came to hospital with the signs of a subacute valve dysfunction.
Koagulase-negative staphylococcus and elevated liquorice were detected in the liquor.
Thrombus must be removed cardio surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
With this routine test, strong positive results for ketone were obtained in the obduction of three clearly as a result of freezing or undercooling of people who died without simultaneously increasing glucose in the urine.
Headspace gas chromatography detected excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/L in all three urine samples.
A strongly positive Keto-Diabur test 5000 with normal glucose findings in urine can thus serve as diagnostic help to detect death as a result of undercooling.
In a prospective study in 94 patients with traumatic hemarthros of the knee joint, it is examined to what extent magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) can make statements about the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide advice for the therapeutic procedure.
infantile acrolocated syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in connection with various infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, eruptively symmetrically appeared on the papal and papulovesikel extremes.
Virus serology pointed to a fresh Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection, while serology for hepatitis B virus was negative.
Jaw joint luxuries occur as a result of dreams, articulation disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the chewing muscles.
The previous classifications are mainly based on the anatomic position of the dislocated jaw joints such as luxation, subluxation and discusluxation.
Etiologically, traumatic and non-traumatic luxuries are distinguished.
For a number of neurological diseases, jaw joint luxuries were described as complication.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent jaw joint luxuries as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these luxuries with botulinum toxin, we explain the introduction of the concept of neurogenetic jaw joint luxation.
Fire paints can cause significant psychosocial strains.
The present study examined a) the coping behavior, the quality of life and the body experience of patients with fire paints and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on the psychosocial parameters.
In 70 patients with fire paints, a test psychological examination has been conducted in the fields of disease management, quality of life and body experience as part of the therapy with the flash lamp pulsed dye laser.
The clinical target criterion was the brightening of the fire during the course of the therapy.
Patients with fire paints experienced similarly high levels of stress with regard to social fears than patients with chronic skin disease.
These corralled with the size and darkness of the fire.
With regard to helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, patients with fire paints were significantly less burdened.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and body experience.
The experience of the body is differently influenced by disease management.
Since the brightening during laser therapy correlates significantly with reduced psychosocial stresses, flash lamp pulsed dye laser therapy can also be considered effective when it comes to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most frequently infested by extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
The primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) represents a standalone disease because biological behavior, prognosis and treatment differ from the nodal lymphomas.
Imaging procedures are important in the search and stage classification of the PGIL.
The gastrointestinal Lymphomes show a variety of pathohistological appearances and a wide range of imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological image and therapeutic options.
For a 43-year-old man, there has been a naevus sebaceus in the area of right-handed sleep since giving birth.
In histopatholo-gic examination, 2 adnexneoplasms associated with lesion were shown:
a Syringocystadenom papilliferum and a trichoblastom.
The combined appearance of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on the history of the anaesthesia (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST lifting, T-wave changes, appearance of Q teeth, newly occurring left thigh block) and elevated levels of "classic heart enzymes" creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of reversible dementias.
This case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia within a few months in an over 80-year-old patient.
Currently, less the psychopathological cross-sectional picture than rather the course of the therapy of the disease allows the difference between primary degenerative dementia with concomitant hypothyroidism and secondary dementia caused by hypothyroidism.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal artery stenosis, an abdominal aneurysm of the left arteria subclavia was successfully switched off by implanting a ballon-expandable JOSTENT© peripheral stent graph.
The trajectory observed over a year showed a very good long-term result in freely perfused stentlum and completely switched off aneurysm.
In a control computer tomography, a completely thrombosed aneurysm bag was found.
Intravascular ultrasound did not indicate neointima hyperplasia within the stent.
The Pyoderma gangraenosum was first described as an independent entity by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary in 1930.
However, in the first half of the 19th century, images can be found in an Atlas work by Marie Nicolas Devergie, which almost obligatoryly suggest a pyoderma gangraenosum.
Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" includes, in addition to cassettes of various forms of syphilitic affections of the skin, individual images of gangraeous ulcers, which were completely unexpectedly occurring under the usual mercury therapy.
The rapidly expanding ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as side effects of this elongating therapy with mercury as they spontaneously healed after their discontinuation.
Therefore, clinical descriptions and figures of the Pyoderma gangraenosum can be found over 100 years before the initial designation.
However, the etiology of this disease has not been sufficiently determined to this day.
Thus, the theory of a primary bacterial genesis of the Pyoderma gangraenosum persisted in several publications until well into the 60s of our century.
Rapid awakening and a rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the essential selection criteria for anaesthesia for outpatient interventions.
This study examines whether the recovery of cognitive functions is faster after TIVA with remifentanil/propofol (P/R) than after a balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F).
Even estradiol concentrations are achieved as in the early follicle phase.
For oral estrogen replacement therapy, estradiol must be dosed 40 times higher compared to TTS treatment to achieve effective but strong fluctuating active substance levels with top supraphysiological values and subnormal lows.
High oral estrogen doses are necessary because liver passage results in pronounced estrogen metabolism.
What is the importance of ultrasonic analysis of the fetus and newborns in diagnosis and therapy planning of meconium hypertension.
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, thindarmatia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia and psychomotor retardation with a partial monosomie of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The measurement of the physical load capacity of patients with mucoviszidose and the detection of load-dependent changes in oxygen saturation were the objectives of the present study.
The reason for updating the WHO classification ofurotheliar lesions or tumours of the bladder was to better meet the biology of the different lesions and to achieve a sharper separation between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The importance for diagnostics and clinics in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistory findings, is considered critical.
Papillaryurothelial lesions include papals, papillar urotheliar neoplasms of low malignant potential and papillar carcinomas.
Flaturotheliaous lesions include flat hyperplasia, atypia (reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision finds its eligibility.
The present study seeks to establish links between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammation of patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by intervention on the sympathetic nervous system.
You then talk about a sympatheticly entertained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), territorial neuropathic pain syndromes and acute herpes zosters.
There is a significant link between sleep quality and mattress quality for people with chronic sleep and back complaints.
The diagnostic routine work-up for renal cell carcinoma staaging includes a multiphasic abdominal spiral CCT and a thoracic crown.
In the case of unclear spiral-CT findings in the questioning of intravenous tumour expansion, the contrast-reinforced MRI can constitute a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications of renal MRI represent patients with absolute or relative contraception for non-ionic X-ray contraceptives, patients at the stage of compensated (but not dialysis required) renal insufficiency and patients with symptomatic polycystic renal infarction.
The conventional cavity is obsolete in the age of (multi-line) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common injuries to the eye in childhood are estimation, burn, lid injury, erosio corneae, cornea, cornea, augapfels, bllow-out fracture, perforating eye injury, endophthalmitis and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is around 12 to 100,000 residents/year.
This represents the most common cause of unilateral inheritance in childhood.
The risk factors for an eye injury in childhood include age (<5 years), gender (male > female), and parental care.
In addition to rapid and adequate therapy, the forecast for visual rehabilitation after eye injury is also influenced by psychosocial factors (compliance in the use of visual aids or adhesion of the eyes for amblyopie prophylaxis).
Defects and dysbalances of the spinal column stabilizing muscles are considered important somatic risk factors for the appearance of back complaints.
Therefore, the preservation and restoration of the full performance of the spinal stabilizing muscles must be the aim of prevention and rehabilitation in addition to the training of coordinative skills and the learning of corrugated behavior.
In addition to the various pain therapeutic measures, physiotherapy techniques including neurophysiological procedures, physical-balneological measures and complementary behavioral training, medical training therapy is an important procedure for the treatment of lubal syndromes.
Medical training therapy covers the use of principles and methods of practice-oriented training and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
In its phase structure, various therapy objectives are presented, but in particular the positive adjustment of the neuromuscular system according to the rehabilitation course.
Indication and monitoring of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
According to the underlying disorder and the course of the therapy, therapy goals and treatment concept are adapted in cooperation with physiotherapists and treating doctors.
The surgical indication of invertebral glides results from pain, progressive glides and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radial dysfunction.
The posterolateral merger in situ is a low-risk process, but deformity persists and in the case of spondyloptosis, a plastic deformation of the ossary spondylodese mass can occur with further progrence of glides.
With the external fixer as a repositioning tool and the internal fixate for stabilization, the reposition of heavy sliding processes and the restoration of a normal spinal and hull form with a reasonable neurological risk is also possible today.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed, that in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, the anatomic reposition of the glide vertebra is also the aim.
Depending on the extent of the slide, reposition and stabilization should take place in 1, 2 or 3 surgical steps.
A single dorsal or ventral merger is sufficient for Grade 1 dislocations.
Combined dorsoventrale spondylodesis is recommended at Grade II and above.
The aim of the evaluation study, which reports on the selected results of this paper, is to assess the impact of a Gerontopsychiatric Centre (GZ):
for the first time, an empirical examination of a combination of outpatient services, day clinics and old-age counselling on the subject of an empirical examination of the transformation process required by the experts’ commission of the Federal Government and the detailed reasoned process of change from "intramural" (stationary) to "extramural" (day clinic and clinical outpatient, i.e. home-based) regional supply structures.
On the basis of extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, changes in the regional supply parts structures of gerontopsychiatric (subsystem A), general medicine (subsystem B) and old-age aid (subsystem C) are analysed by comparing the supply region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ) changes in the regional supply parts structures of gerontopsychiatrics (subsystem A), general medicine (subsystem B) and old-age aid (subsystem C).
The investigation results in subsystem A, that a GZ has significant impact on the intended structural form of intra-to-extraural care without segregating its clientele according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
An effect of the GZ on the system of old-age aid (subsystem C) may be reflected in the fact that in the goods-loh supply region, the home-initiation rate is much lower after clinical-stationary treatment than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis on the right arm with system signs (fiber, leukocytosis) and massive movement limitation in the right shoulder joint.
In addition to an oedema of skin and fat tissues, extensive accumulations of fluids around the deep muscle muscles, in the interstitiates and - less pronounced - in the shoulder joint were also detected.
Systemic corticosteroid therapy quickly cured skin lesions, and later also restored mobility in the shoulder joint.
In the described case, for the first time, the involvement of joint-related structures in the context of eosinophilic cellulitis was demonstrated using modern imaging procedures.
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide enables brute-resistant treatment in larger tumours that are primarily unfit for breast-sustaining treatment.
The tumour can be traced with mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
For the mammography speaks the good reproducibility and availability.
Mathematically non-delimitable tumours can usually be represented as sonographically.
In MRI, tumour expansion is independent of the structure and density of the mamma parenchym.
- Determination of the extension of tumour residuals after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is restricted by all available methods, as microscopically small invasive and especially non-invasive tumour residues can hardly be detected.
These also don't form when the invasive tumour is recreated and typically display intraductive, non-invasive tumour residuals.
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease is clinically presented with symmetrical paralysis, area flexibility and pronounced vegetative disorders.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for transferring a patient with GBS to the intensive care unit.
This report discusses the treatment of the pronounced GBS at the intensive care unit using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
In the case of morphologically suitable stenoses, stent implantation without pre-strengthens appears to be able to immediately create an emerging dissection and thus prevent it.
Neurosurgical therapy procedures for Parkinson's disease (PK) experience a worldwide renaissance, based on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a double-track functional model clarifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal cores, making them potential target locations for neurosurgical procedures.
His pathological disinhibition is caused, among other things, by overactivity of the nucleus subthalamicus (north).
Successfully, experimental lesions of these cores were tested in the MPTP-damaged patient. - Both lenient and restorative and stimulative procedures are used in the clinic.
The previously applied techniques of pallidotomy and Thalamotomie have become more precise thanks to better neuroradiological and physiological destination.
The former technique is used to treat Rigor, hypokinesia and drug-induced dyskinesia, the latter method has proved to be used to treat the tremor.
Only in the transplantation of fetal cells is a new prosthesis of dopamine neurons and increased striatal dopamine distribution is documented;
However, the procedure raises ethical and immunological problems.
The high-frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal passages is the latest method and is characterised by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most common is the stimulation of thalamus nuclei for treating the tremor;
In the animal-experimental approach, Xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells stand.
However, long-term comparisons between the individual procedures are required to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic al-coholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcoholic disorder in addition to more common diseases such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal cramp, Wernicke-Korsakow syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits (heemiparesis, hemianopia or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures and periodic side-stressed steep potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chroni-schemical alcohol abusus was taken after several secondary generalized focal seizures of the right body side under the suspected diagnosis of encephalitis.
Laboratory tests showed higher levels of Gamma GT and MCV.
In CCT and cerebral MRI, microangiopathy and brain atrophy were shown.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and triple anti-convulsive therapy, epileptic seizures and a worsening general condition were observed.
Several EEG investigations revealed periodic steep left parietookzipital waves.
Three months after the onset of symptomaticism, the patient died of pneumonia.
The clinical picture described corresponds to the criteria of SESA syndrome.
Solitary Basaliomas in childhood and adolescence without association with basal cell naevussyndrom (BZNS), an Xeroderma pigmentosum, an organoid naevus or after radiotherapy are very rare (up to 86 cases in world literature).
Etiologically, it could be an abortive form of the BZNS or the result of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Investigations into repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage are not yet available in these patients.
A 10-year-old boy is reported with a solitary nodulal basaloma of the right infraorbital region.
Neither the history nor clinical examination gave evidence of a genetic disposition on basalioment formation.
In 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), an immunohistochemical and morphometrial study was performed to compare morphological and clinical findings and assess the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
On the basis of the morphometrial analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megacardiocytes could be calculated with the fiber density of their foreshore cells.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between the megacaryopoesis and the fibroblasts in relation to the complex patho Mechanism of myelofibrosis.
This was observed in approximately 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
Similarly, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of ret40f+ nucleus-containing erythropoetic foreshore cells, which can be associated with the integration of this ceiling line into the iron metabolism, the Hאmoglobin synthesis and the dismantling of the extruded normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl residue-exploring) pseudo-smoking cells were shown in 30% of biopsies before treatment.
In addition, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoesis or an increase in fibrillation with clinical parameters such as Hאmoglobin, the proportion of myelo and erythro normaloblasts in peripheral blood and the migraine could be calculated.
These variables obviously mark more advanced stages of the CML.
According to our morphometrial evaluation, a classification was made into three different histological subgroups:
This simplistic histological classification was assigned to corresponding hאmatological data.
Sequence biopsies in 173 patients receiving monotherapy with IFN, Hydroxyurea (HU) or Busulfan (BU) showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN, unlike a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main cloves during treatment were best illustrated by a calculation of indices.
These included the breakdown of quantitative differences between the individual variables in the repetitive withdrawals and the assigned time differences.
For example, in patients with a complete remission to IFN-Gabe, the regeneration of erythropoesis together with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages had to be observed in their activated subpopulation.
The histological subgroups detect a ‹mountain of both a (non-fiber) granulocyte and megacaryocyte subtype in a myelofibrotic group in about 40% of patients.
This phenom was in contrast to a number of reductions in myelofibrotic type, especially in patients with HU therapy in 17 cases (36%).
Collectively, the striking heterogeneity of the bone marrow findings in the CML requires a carefree morphological evaluation of biopsies using suitable methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain a better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 patients taken in a medical-geriatric department should be diagnosed with a naturalistic design regarding mental disorders.
On the basis of the clinical examination and the values in the Mini-Mental State Examination (2), 51 patients were considered not to be inspectable.
The other 74 patients were clinically and with screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Demental developments may have been detected or excluded by neuropsychological testing.
In 41 patients, mental disorders of disease value (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found, with over half of them relevant to overall treatment at the clinic.
The screening tools used proved reliable, so they can be recommended for further use.
However, it remains clear how the mental disorder therapy required after this outcome in every 5th to 6th patients can be ensured in the setting of a medical-geriatric department.
The inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliacal joints is the key symptom of spondylarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
The conventional visual diagnostics of sacroiliitis are considered problematic in the early stages because the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very small here.
The magnetic resonance tomography of the sacroiliac joints is capable of capturing both acutely inflammatory and chronic changes in all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method are search dependency, so far lack of standardization and the still relatively high costs.
Therefore, the "Working Group for Imaging Diagnostics in the Rheumatology of the Regional Rheuma Centre Berlin", composed of experienced Rheumatologists, Skelettradiologists and Orthopaedics, has developed an overview of the imaging diagnostics of Sacroiliitis, in which in addition to the clinical background, technical details are executed and radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness are taken into account.
Hyperimmunglobulin E syndrome (Job's Syndrome, Job Syndrome, Buckley Syndrome) is a rare disease of the immune system that can show characteristic manifestations in the NO area.
The disease is characterised by recurrent urticary exanthemums, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphatic organs and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Diagnostically, strongly increased serum IgE concentrations are concomitantly lacking signs of allergic and parasitic disease.
Therapy with high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) proved excellently tolerable and well effective.
More than a year after once-in-a-lifetime therapy, symptomaticism has been continuously improved.
The current state of knowledge and available therapy options for hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In hyper-IgE syndrome, an IVIG therapy should be the first choice option.
This thesis presents the results according to laparoscopic "floppy Nissen" findoplicatio in 70 patients based on quality of life data 3 years after surgery.
The individual subdimensions of the GLQI show corresponding scores.
More than 98% of all patients assess the success of the surgery with very good or good results and would undergo new anti-reflux surgery if necessary.
Continuous, but not adverse, adverse effects of surgery were reported by 4 patients.
No patient needed further antireflux therapy.
Laparoscopic refundoplicatio was necessary due to persistent dysphagia in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months.
The effectiveness of the surgical therapy of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease can be documented and proven in the longer term not only by objective findings but also by the subjective assessment of the patient and by measuring quality of life data.
Clinical symptomaticism with neuroglucopenia is evidenced by inappropriate high insulin and C peptide secretion in hypoglycaemia in the hunger test.
Standard surgery is the enucleation of the tumour or, depending on size and location, the resection.
Problematic is the treatment of multiple tumours and isle cell hyperplasia, which are loaded with a high relapse rate.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be superior to selective tumour removal.
In malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastasis, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are available.
Any form of active death aid is punishable in accordance with Article 216 of the German Civil Code (StGB).
Even from a medical point of view, she is ethically unjustifiable.
The diverse trends do not change anything to tighten the "kill on request" as in the Netherlands under certain conditions.
Nutrients and nutrient-independent trophic factors affect both proliferation and differentiation of different cell components of the gut wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be mentally distinguished from immunologically effective cells of the colon-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and is an essential supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine is particularly apparent in seriously ill patients.
The amino acids Arginine and Ornithine are particularly important for the eutrophic of immune-competent intestinal cells as starting substances of NO and polyamine synthesis.
Fermentable carbohydrates are bacterially categorized into the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate in the lower intestinal sections.
These exert a trophic effect on the colon mucous membrane, among other things, through an improvement in blood flow.
Among the food-independent substances, it is mainly the hormones Gastrin and Enteroglukagon as well as different growth factors that contribute to the preservation of eutrophic mucous membrane.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stresses on physical and psychological sensitivity.
By applying a diary as a measuring instrument, individual evaluations of situative influence factors of care and, on the other hand, load-enhancing factors in the care process could be identified.
The results show both large individual differences in the assessment of stress factors and their impact on physical and psychological sensitivity.
Continuous fractures of the valley are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis for acute and chronic pain in the area of the leap joints.
Early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus significantly affects the long-term outcome.
Computer tomography (CT) is essential for the definitive diagnosis and indication of the therapy to be taken.
Dislocated fractures lead conservatively treated, as far as presented in literature and according to their own experience, pain and movement limitation and thus in the long term to arthrotic reconstruction of the subtalar joint.
However, in the indication of an operational approach it can be recognized from the sparse literature that large fragments should be refixed anatomically to allow for a follow-up cure.
Rugged fractures and small dislocated fragments should be recreated, although the long-term course cannot be estimated due to possibly changed joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still far from clear, there are a number of recent findings about the basic patho mechanisms and causes of the disease.
Thus, the propagation of dermal mast cells and a high regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines is also detectable in uninfested skin and increased P-sectin in the serum, indicating a systemic activation of the acute inflammation system in urticaria.
In acute mast cells, we were also able to demonstrate activating dot mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lenient skin mast cells in indolent mast cells but not in childhood forms.
In contrast to the general assumption, acute urticaria is rarely based on IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, on the other hand, pseudoallergies on food (73%) and rare chronic inflammation of the gastric intestinal tract (11%) play a role, with long-lasting remissions in Meiden (diet) or elimination of the triggers.
In the case of chronic urticaria, autoantibodies are mainly considered secondary rather than disease-induced.
A capulothoracal dissociation (SD) is a complex injury to the shoulder belt, most of which socialises with vitally threatening injury patterns within the context of polytraumes.
The 3 case reports are intended to represent the variability of possible injuries along with capulothoracal dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare and mostly only treatment in trauma centers.
The three cases are reproduced in the temporal process of polytrauma management, as well as the differentiated possibilities of care.
Reports from previous working groups in the context of multi-center studies with only a small patient group show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus define as standards, the current guidelines are explained, with cross-references to management together with patients who are most often polytraumatized and therefore vitally threatened.
In a retrospective study, the predictive relevance of e-Cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed.
Of 74 of these 78 patients, the postoperative course is known over 2 months to 35.2 years (median 3.6 years;
A weak or negative e-cadherin expression (<=20%) was found in higher T-states, with increased synchronous lymph nodes and remote metastases.
In statistical analysis, e-cadherin expression (<= 20%/ > 20%), synchronous remote metastasy (M0/pM1, cM1) and the radicality of intervention (R0/R1, 2) proved to be predictive.
Our data speaks for the predictive importance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measuring, mumps and roasting are becoming more and more a danger to adults as the age peak shifts.
With the MMR combination vaccination, an effective method for preventing this disease and its consequences is available.
2-time consistent MMR vaccination can eliminate measles and mumps and make ruble embryopathy a condition of the past.
The aim of the interdisciplinary longitudinal study of adulthood (ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and satisfied ageing in both middle and higher adulthood.
A comparison of age groups showed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness and compatibility.
In regional comparison, personality differences were shown in the areas of neuroticism, openness and conscience as well as subjective wellbeing.
Meaning interactions between the age group and the region resulted in openness and in some under-tests of cognition measurement and doctor judgment.
Intraabdominal abscesses occur in more than 80% of an intraabdominal organ and arise mostly after abdominal surgery.
The anatomy is divided into intraperitoneal, visceral and anterior retroperitoneal spaces.
The sonographically or CT-controlled percutaneous drainage is a low-complication and effective procedure with a success rate of about 80%.
Liver abscesses are mostly interventional, pancreatic, spleen and crohn's abortions are treated almost always surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intraabdominal absessive conglomerate tumours (uberculosis, actinomycose, amoebiasis) are diagnosed late due to their rareness and offer pathological-anatomic, diagnostic and therapeutic features.
From the mid to late 80s, different groups of researchers tried to improve the predictive of premature birth in premature birth through immunological diagnostics - particularly through cytokine proof.
However, this prenatal diagnosis has proved to be detrimental to date only from the fruit water, i.e. by amniocentesis, but not from the serum of pregnant women.
The reason for this is that the placenta cabinet for cytokines is almost impermeable, as demonstrated in the placenta fusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokind diagnosis is the high fluctuation width of the individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts were made to establish other methods of detection or to develop a cytokine pattern.
Possibly the cytokine proof from the pregnant women’s cervix is a viable way for the future.
The strain of the fixater internal for the spine was measured with instrumentated implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest loads were found during walking and lateralflexion during standing.
During the ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant load only changed slightly.
No higher fixate loads were measured in sitting than in standing.
It therefore speaks little about allowing patients who have been stabilized mono or bisegmentally to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand up.
The additional ventral stabilization with bone chips has often significantly changed the load of the bisegmental implants.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often much higher than before after ventral stabilization.
A corset or migraine did not reduce the implant load.
It is therefore not necessary to provide patients with a corset after mono or bisegmental stabilization of the breast or lumbar column.
Meningeoms are among the most common intracranial tumours in adulthood.
The so-called atypical meningema was added in 1993 to the revised version of the WHO classification for tumours of the central nervous system and is said to refer to meningeomas with an increased recurrence compared to common meningomas.
Since the same qualitative-histological criteria are given for this meningosome as for anaplastic meningema, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be subject to certain uncertainties.
We searched for other predictive parameters:
With the help of the morphometrically determined core surface-related Ki-67 (MIB1) index, 95% confidence intervals were calculated for meningeoms of all 3 degrees (N=160), which were shown to be valid compared to the "recidive"-free intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningeoms are characterised by a little structured, "synzytial" growth patterns and large prominent nuclei.
Nucleomorphy, necrosis and mitotic figures were optional.
Cytogeneticly, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningemas, apart from the typical loss of chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, showed a distal loss in the short arm of a chromosome 1 (1p-) in 50% of cases.
Histochemically, we were able to show that the tissue-unspecific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structure is at 1p, can be used as a progressive and relapsed brand receptor (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediary and 8/8 anaplastic meningomas).
Instead of the concept of "atypical", which is ambiguous in clinical everyday life and may cause misinterpretations in connection with tumour grading, we propose the term Meningeome of the intermediary type between the usual and the anaplastic meningomas.
Due to the special anatomic situation, the joint fractures take a special position within the lower jaw fractures.
Computer tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnostics.
The indication for surgical treatment is for strongly dislocated or luxurious fractures.
As operational access, pre-auricular, sub- or perimandibular, retromandibular and oral access are established.
To fix the fragments, only functionally stable processes such as the mini plate or pull screw should be used.
Analyzing the diagnostic value of contrast-reinforced, biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO reinforced MRI in patients with V.a. focal liver lesions prior to any liver surgery.
We report the manifestation of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basaliomas as well as palmoplant arthritis after treatment of a psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic liquor Fowleri (Fowler's);
As a side-effect, Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was also diagnosed.
Background and questioning.
Despite the great importance of dermatoses in Black Africa, dermatology is completely inadequately represented in the basic health services established there.
The long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the Primary Health Care system should be examined in relation to the prevalence of skin diseases.
The growth speed and the potential impact of cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are shown.
The aim of the study was to determine the acute and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary reanimation (CPR) within and outside a single hospital of priority care.
The PhotoDermVL enables a large selection of individually selectable treatment parameters through the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy density.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential teleangectasis, naevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, Spider Naevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertricoses can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Mamma carcinoma metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumour in the woman.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, identification of risk factors regarding occurrence and the evaluation of the benefits of early treatment of this primarily asymptomatic tumour manife station.
The systemic Lupus erythematodes is a potentially life-threatening condition in acute thrust.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic gradient forms are often hardly masterable.
In addition, numerous therapy-induced adverse reactions occur over the course of the often high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants.
We report 2 cases of acutely exacerbated systemic lupus erythematodes, which were hardly to be controlled by the administration of high doses of prednisolon and cyclophosphamide/Azathioprine.
Both fakes were treated with high dose intravenously administered immunoglobulins in addition to immunosuppression performed with IgM-approved patients.
In both cases, the immunosuppressants that were originally high-dose (prednisolon, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) could be excreted up to minimal maintenance therapy.
After 9 cycles of therapy each, patients with minimal immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with prednisolon remained uncommon during the 1-year period of post-ocular therapy.
Our observation shows that IgM enriched immunoglobulins are suitable for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematodes.
10-25% of all children in school age complain about recurrent abdominal pain, which is one of the most common complaints images in childhood.
Nevertheless, our knowledge of this syndrome is still very gaping in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp (340-450 nm, Max.
365 nm) is primarily used in the diagnostics of dermatitis associated with typical fluorescence (Tinea capitis, Erythrasma, Tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyries and pigment changes).
In addition to the detection of systemically administered medicines (tetracycline), fluorescence under wood light has been used by adding fluorescence markers in application control of topics.
In the case of induction of hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms in the context of programmed ventricular stimulation, endocardial mapping is possible.
The most important building block of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the circulation through stimulation manoeuvres (“Entrainment mapping”) and the analysis of the post-Pacing interval.
In clinical occurrence and induction of only singular chamber tachycardia, an acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in approximately 60-70% of cases due to high frequency catheter ablation.
This success rate is significantly lower for multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases, recurrence must be expected.
In the case of incessant ("incessant") chamber tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia after implantation of cardiovascular defibrillator, the indication for early catheterrablation exists.
Currently, ventricular tachycardia is a complementary therapy procedure for drug treatment and the implantation of cardiovascular defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future through new mapping and ablation techniques.
From 1 to 31 December 1995, 386 patients with rectumcarcinoma in UICC stage I-III were retrospectively studied in 386 patients with rectumcarcinoma in UICC stage I-III after conventional surgical interventions and R0 resection of the tumour of the influence of the dissected lymph nodes on tumour staging and local recurrence rate.
In the univariate analysis, we found a significant link between the number of dissected and the number of infested lymph nodes, and consequently a significant increase in the UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and the pTxpN2 category (p = 0,000).
A significant decrease in the local recurrence rate depending on the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be detected for UICC stage I and II.
In the overall disease and in multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no effect on local recurrence rates.
Our results show that the lowering of the local recurrence rate in UICC stage I and II is due not to a therapeutic effect, but to a shift in stage in the context of a more accurate tumour stagnation.
This points to the impact of other surgically affected factors, particularly the total mesorectal excision for the emergence of locoregionary recidivism.
So far, echocardiography lacks uniform standards for finding documentation.
However, these standards are necessary to ensure comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic findings communication, so that the demands for quality assurance in echocardiography are met.
Decreasing incidences of active tuberculosis in industrialized countries have displaced this disease from the consciousness of many.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis remains the world’s leading infectious disease.
In industrialized countries, factors such as immigration movements, increasing impoverishment and the increase in immune-uppressed patients, particularly through the HIV epidemic, contribute to maintaining a reservoir for tuberculosis.
The scarring pemphigoid (cicatricial pemphigoid, CP) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with sub-epidermal bladder formation and scarring that manifests to the skin and mucous membrane.
Approximately 70% of patients are affected.
Aortic root abscesses have long been known as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18) in literature.
The discovery of these abscesses through echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
As with other diseases asymptomatic processes (18, 19, 20, 21), clinical asymptomatic abscesses have not yet been reported.
The abundance of insights that have accumulated over the Interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since its first description are increasingly touching areas of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 is particularly apparent in 2 areas of dermatology:
Firstly, there are enough knowledge that makes IL-7 appear as an interesting immunotherapeutic agenz especially in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study with IL-7-modified tumour cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore currently initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and seems to significantly affect the stay and growth of normal T cells and lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
In this overview, molecular, immunological and preclinical properties as well as perspectives for applications of the IL-7 in dermatology are to be outlined.
The high-dose dose of Gd-DTPA-BMA (Gadodiamide, Omniscan) is suitable for contrast-assisted magnetic resonance tomography of malignant bone tumours and whether dynamic studies at this dose allow an assessment of response to preoperative chemotherapy.
This thesis aims to make a conceptual contribution to the concept of everyday competence.
After the introductory discussion of reasons for increasing attention to everyday competence in gerontology, six research flows with relevance to everyday competence are outlined in a first part:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those by Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an inclusive conception of everyday competence is presented, which aspects of the six research flows intertwine with essential elements of the two everyday competence models.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumour control with increased overall treatment time of fractionated radiation therapy.
The most likely cause of disparate time factor is proliferation of clonal tumour cells during therapy.
Therefore, a targeted inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment could potentially achieve significant advances in radiooncology.
In a short overview, the options for minimizing the time factor are discussed.
Inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic tumour cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation stimulating signal transduction pathways or by pharmacological inhibition of tumour neoangiogenesis is scientifically interesting, but has not yet been established in its effectiveness in minimizing the time factor to the results of radiation therapy.
The only currently secured method is the conduction of radiation therapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g. through accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating unplanned treatment interruptions.
The acute inflammation reaction is likely to play an important role in pathogenesis, but also in diagnosis and forecasting of acute coronary syndrome.
We studied 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.5 SD 13.9 years) within an hour of intake and at the 4-24h interval with respect to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were observed to 6 weeks after discharge with respect to primary endpoint death or renewed acute coronary syndrome. Results:
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% for patients with positive CRP and TnT 42 days after redundancy compared to 35.3% of TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
The logistical regression regarding the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (each after 4-24h), age, gender and diagnosis revealed an independent impact of TnT (Cutoff 0.1μg/L, p=0,048, Odds Ratio=7,5) and CRP (Cutoff 0,862mg/dL, p=0,026, Odds Ratio=5,3).
Sensitivity/specificity for AMI diagnosis were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP in 4-24h.
Highly sensitive CRPs are little helpful in addition to troponin T for acute infarction diagnosis.
However, the assessment of patients’ forecast by TnT is significantly independently supplemented by CRP 4-24h after intake, and thus substantially improved.
A 51/2-year-old girl with an optic gliome and a resultant hydrocephalus internus developed a progredient astute 7 months after implanting a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content was found in the liquor and ascension fluid.
For the first time, the blood-liquor barrier disorder was found as a cause of the elevated liquorice white by means of liquor protein electrophoresis.
The Ileumconduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urination with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, liver damage with portal hypertension increases the risk of recurrent, peracute and transfusional conduit bleeding.
While the diagnosis is simple, different therapy options are available.
Mostly, the source of bleeding lies in variably extended vessels in the stoma, so that local sclerosis with 3% ethoxysklerol or the suppression of the bleeding vessel offers itself.
The resection of the vari-borne conduit is an option for life-threatening bleeding or if the source of bleeding cannot be localized.
For frequent recurrent bleeding, the lifting of the conduit must also be considered.
A malignant must be excluded as a cause for any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumour cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-related genes - protooncogenes and tumour uppressors - which can provide novel diagnostic and predictive parameters.
Meningema and gliome are among the most genetically characterized solid tumours:
A number of specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known to be associated with clinical parameters such as recurrent inclination of meningomas or malignant progression of astrophysics.
The focal progression, particularly typical for gliomes with the consequence of intratumoral heterogeneity, is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumour cells, which are also co-determined by radiation or chemotherapies.
A 48-year-old woman imagined with increasing dyspnoea due to thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
In the patient, a coral valve set (St. Jude Medical) had been performed 6 years before due to coral stenosis III.
Three years later, there was a flap detombosis that required a flap exchange (St. Jude Medical).
In the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumour progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become increasingly understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the release of carcinoma cells from the epithelial association by loss of cell-cell adhesion, the invasion of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis and by entering the blood or lymph system.
The intravastation of tumour cells is encouraged by angiogenetic factors that can lead to degradation of the basal membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, leaving the vascular system and induction of angiogenesis constitute further important steps in the metastatic process.
In addition, a tumour cell will survive only when entering circulation if it escapes immunological defense.
With the systematic identification of tumour antigens, new possibilities for immunotherapeutic measures have opened up.
Multiple endocrine neoplasm type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumour disease of the neuro-endocrine cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in ancillary gland, pancreas, duodenum and hypophysis, rarely also in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 11.
It is thought that this gene belongs to the tumour suppressors, whose all-elic loss triggers the development of neoplasia.
The tumours in pancreatic, duodenum and thymus can metastasize, but usually have low malignancy potential.
Clinically, the MEN 1 manifests most often between the ages of 20 and 35, especially through hyperparathyroidism and/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical trials concerned the reduction of endothelial cell density after perforating keratoplasty using different conservation methods of donor tissue.
In spite of long known dynamic cell loss, very variable follow-up intervals were summarized.
The aim of this investigation was to conduct a long-term endothelial finding at the same dates, taking into account 2 different conservation techniques.
Patients with oral long-term anticoagulation with cumarine products have a differently high risk of thromboembolism, which requires prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of cumarine and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of clotting inhibition (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In the case of selective interventions, cumarine is pre-operatively discontinued 2-3 days, in case of emergency interventions the need for vitamin K or Fresh Frozen plasma substitution results.
Operations in patients with heparin therapy or prophylaxis are more unproblematic, as the heparin effect in discontinuation will decrease within a few hours.
Results from various epidemiological studies are available for the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany.
In the transmission of the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies to the overall population of Germany, estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients are estimated.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be due to problems with patient analysis, the epidemiological area and the structure of the respective population.
To avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was recorded by a representative survey in doctor groups relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The detriment of this method of survey is the lack of explanation of the diagnosis.
The high-calculation and subsequent combination of the results of the survey of individual doctoral groups showed a number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 to 100,000 inhabitants and is in the range of Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category " MS in question" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
It was examined here how the emergency care is performed and whether relevant findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopaedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells that produce increasing growth factors in the area of fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be considered as a new promising technique of situ Tissue Engineering, which can be expected to be used clinically in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are sufficiently diagnosed by the GP.
The quality of the doctor-patient talk is crucial for diagnosis and therapy.
While in the 70s the doctor's style of conversation was considered a personality variant, current empirical studies into the doctor-patient talk suggest that the doctor's conversational behavior is understood as an interactive process by both communication partners (pharmacy patients) align their conversation behavior.
Training programs to improve baseline psychosomatic competence often show little success because they do not reflect the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the center of the Düsseldorfer training and training program on basic psychosomatic care.
The concept of training as well as experience with this one are finally presented and discussed.
Data for the prediction of heart failure has so far been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies and clinical intervention studies.
All these sources are limited to clinical routines.
Programming the language processor of a "cochlear implant" (CI) in young children, specifically the determination of the stimulation strength that corresponds to the maximum acceptable volume (MAL), is often difficult.
Over-stimulation must be avoided, as this can have traumatic effects in the child.
The aim of this study was to analyse the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds triggered by the CI and the MAL and hearing thresholds defined in postoperative speech processor adjustment in 27 carriers of three different implant types.
In practice, an applicable objective instrument for simplification, refinement and acceleration of language processor programming has been examined.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants irritated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as percentiles of the average ESR threshold current level via all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated based on the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex thresholds showed, for example, large deviations to the thresholds effectively determined by behavioral audiometrics.
Therefore, no safe and easy calculation of the MAL and the hearing threshold was possible due to the intraoperative SR threshold.
However, the intraoperative identification of the ESR threshold may contribute to a computational limitation of the area to be examined alongside intraoperative function control.
However, the exact MAL will have to be determined in a different, temporary behavioral audiometric way.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swelling in the red proportions of a multi-coloured jewellery tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammation reaction could be distinguished from real lymphoma by electron microscopic, immunohistochemical and molecular biology.
Evidence of numerous dendritic dendritic cells in the infiltrate may result from a dermal allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
Therapy of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Presentation of new diagnostic possibilities in the kidney through rapid magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old patient, a chicken-sized boneless or wart-less overcounted breast gland had developed during 8 years in the left front ash line.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desirable.
In the context of endoprothetic surgery, damage may occur from the joint adjacent artery vessels.
On the basis of 4 case studies, both high-acute and masked complication options and applied therapy are described.
A vascular status of extremes should be raised before and after endoprosthetic surgery.
Under delusion, inter-subjective beliefs are understood with a tendency to subjective certainty that, as the subject of psychiatric experience with knowledge of their reliance on mental disorder, lose the alien character.
Immaginations from which madness arise are dynamically expressed in the structural context according to their position.
The pressure of updates on imaginations and increased in psychotic constitutions is the precondition of madness.
Moreover, the failure of the deformation caused by the psychotic disorganization of the structure must be supplemented.
Explained by a casuistics, which stem from the initial stages of schizophrenic madness, these considerations are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of chronication.
The inflammatory pseudotumor usually occurs singularly and is a naming tumour that was first described in the lungs.
The case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nose breathing disability is described as a result of thickening the front septum.
Macroscopically, a flowery kohl-like tumour was shown in the area of the front septum cartilage, which was completely resinated.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Differential diagnoses are discussed on the basis of an overview of relevant literature.
The therapy of choice consists of a complete surgical resection of the tumour.
In the presented study, we therefore introduce the possibilities of finger and finger cap arteries in healthy subjects with color-coded duplex sonography.
The question was whether a standardized representation of such small vessels with the color doubler system we use is technically possible.
As a result, we found that the presentation was possible in all subjects examined (n=10).
It is also shown in a patient with endangiitis obliterant that pathological variations in vessels of this magnitude can be detected with the method - with corresponding equipment and testing technology.
The aim of this retrospective investigation is to assess the need to re-implant a cardiovascular/defibrillator generator (ICD) in patients with battery exhaustion of the impulse generator and not clinical arrhythmia during the function duration of the first implanted system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instruments as well as the use of intrathoracal visualization systems enables the execution of operations at the mitral flap via a limited right-anterolateral thoracic.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses.
These are aggressive, locally infiltrating but non metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% relapse rate.
Dreams, endocrine and genetic factors play a leading role.
Preferred localizations are the tribe and the tribal extremes.
By combining various imaging processes, the number of differential diagnoses can also be limited to a few in addition to the size and extension of the tumour.
In the past years of surgical resection, adjuvant therapy such as irradiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy have become increasingly important.
Mutilating interventions and interventions with subsequent loss of function are only justified when repeated, unmanageable relapses occur.
The treatment concept of atopic eczema includes continuous basic topical dermatological therapy in combination with limited exacerbation-oriented anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, system therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response to topical therapy or to achieve remission during therapy-resistant processes.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and aciclovir are used in microbial superinfections.
Exacerbation can often be successfully met by phototherapy, especially by UVA1.
The use of systemic immune therapeutics such as glucocorticosteroids, ciclosporin or azathioprine can usually be waived in the treatment of atopic eczema or, in a few exceptional cases, constitutes a therapeutic alternative.
The present casuistics describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented himself with a watery nasal secretion, recurrent epistaxis and a slowly progressive, left accented nose breathing disability in the NO section of the BwK Ulm for clarification.
The clinical examination and the CT of the nasal cavities showed a tumour filling in the full left nasal cavity and apparently starting from the middle nasal passage.
The tumour was resealed via a midfacial degloving in toto.
Histological treatment revealed the diagnosis of neurinoma.
On the basis of this casuistics and an overview of literature, the diagnostics and therapy of this rare nose tumour are presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversially assessed treatment method for lumbal disc prolapation.
Statistically, although rare complications occur after chemonucleolysis than in surgical therapy procedures of lumbal disc prolapation, they sometimes lead to significant impairments.
The most serious complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal bleeding and transverse myelitids.
This must be taken into account in indication of chemonucleolysis and in patients’ education.
Six patients with Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were treated cryptically with success.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy constitutes an effective and little burdensome treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as a therapy alternative against systemic treatment with Dapson.
Based on the questions as needed, the use and effectiveness of psychosomatic consiliar/liaison services, the effectiveness of psychosomatic-dermatological consiliary activity was for the first time examined more closely in this study.
The extent of compliance according to the treatment recommendation was recorded and their connection to potential impact factors such as frequency of contact, preset and satisfaction with consultation, as well as clinical and demographic characteristics was reviewed.
Two years after the consultation, cataract questionnaires were sent for this purpose and the sick records were evaluated.
In a sample of total n=69 patients with a recommendation for action, a compliance rate of 78.3% was found, with a rate of 69% for the subgroup with a psychotherapy recommendation.
There was no significant association with clinical or demographic characteristics, nor did the frequency of contact with the conversation have had any impact.
Only one conversation was held in 70.5% of cases.
A positive preset for consultation and a pleasant conversation experience had an impact on compliance.
Overall, with relatively little time and workload, high efficiency could be achieved.
A 29-year-old patient with an unusual face pigment is reported.
In the clinical context, pigmentation corresponded to a naevus spilus, in histological diagnostics the existence of multiple blue naevi could be secured, alongside a lowly pronounced lentiginous component as well as a dermal melanocytosis.
Immunochemically, the melanocyte cell elements showed expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change proves to be the unusual combination of a lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nuevi and a dermal melanocytosis.
Patients who have to undergo vascular surgery often need far more fluid intraoperatively than is expected through preoperative soberness, intraoperative fluid loss and ventilation.
Changes in starling forces - particularly vascular permeability - may play a role here, with no further analysis of them so far.
In the past, the discussion of the results of the open surgical procedures on the spine, particularly on surgical complications such as post-discotomies syndrome, has led to the search and use of less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of the lumbar disc incident.
The percutaneous nucleotomy processes are techniques that build on different intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal disc windowing or chemonucleolysis.
The mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, the automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser processes and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed for the 70 years as a clinical step.
The results in patient treatment vary from about 30% good and very good to nearly 100% good and very good results depending on the author and study.
It is striking that the prospective randomized studies that compare groups - whether conservative or surgically treated patients - are very rare.
Here, the results of the intradiscal treatment procedures are more critically and with lower success rates than the sometimes retrospectively studied representations of individual techniques, which, although they often have very large case numbers but cannot withstand hard scientific criteria of the study design well.
It should be noted that the percutaneous nucleotomy processes can only treat a part of the lumbal disc disease, since limited indication is required for successful therapy.
At this point in time, the percutaneous nucleotomy processes must be limited to a lower number of cases compared to endoscopic and microchirgis.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial closure systems have become an essential part of invasive cardiology.
This overview compares the four closure systems VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their priority when used after coronary interventions.
The published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC and DU are 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% each.
Haemostase times are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14' with mobilization times of 6-9 h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.
Smaller complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems were able to show a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, everyone has documented a significant decrease in haemostase time.
The increased wellbeing of patients is essentially based on lock removal immediately after coroner intervention.
Arterial locking systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by shortening the duration of stay.
For the treatment of pervasive macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the rear glass body bark and, if necessary, epiretinal membranes from the retina to relieve the macular from the suspected intravitreal forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also deducted the membranea limitans interna (MLI) from the retina for some time.
The clinical results and ultrastructural findings of distant MLI are reported.
The randomized studies for the comparison of thrombolysis and primrose dilatation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left thigh block, non-diagnostic first electrocardiograms, pr-hospital time of >= 12 h or an unknown pr-hospital period.
In order to describe these patient groups and compare the impact of Lyse and Primאr dilatation, we examined the data from the "maximum individual optimized therapy in acute myocardial infarction" (MITRA) study.
Drug addict who died of fulminant viral hepatitis in liver coma 5 days after the first symptoms occurred.
serological diagnostics revealed hepatic hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and a superinfection with Delta virus (Delta hepatitis only postmortal detected).
This has resulted in protracted fat eboly (over days) into the lung flowway with consecutive extravasation and deposit of the fat in alveolar macrophages.
In 40 Alzheimer's patients, 5 patients with dementias of other causes and 36 cognitively inconspicuous control persons, the Tau protein was determined in the cerebrospinal liquor.
Among Alzheimer's patients, 19 were at a very slight stage of the disease (small in the mini-mental state test 25 to 28 points).
A significant increase of Tau was also measured against the control persons.
A less pronounced increase in Tau was shown in patients with other dementias.
In Alzheimer’s patients, there was no quantitative link between the elevation of Tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficit, determined with SPECT.
The results are an indication that Tau may also be elevated at the predemental stage of Alzheimer's disease and is suitable as a biological indicator for early detection.
In the last decade, an unusual amicrobular intertriginal dermatosis has been described in a total of 16 patients suffering from autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was sterile pustulous dermatitis, especially in intertriginal regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically impossibly impossible sub-corneal partial spongiform neutrophic pustulations.
This thesis describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restoration remains an important problem after reconstructive vessel interventions.
As underlying pathogenesis mechanisms, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodeling processes are accepted.
Decreased programmed cell death (apoptosis) could also contribute to residualosing by extending the survival time of intimate cells with the result of cell accumulation and the emergence of hyperplastic lesions.
To this end, human atherectomy samples of 25 primary and 14 residual lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were obtained through TUNEL test (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimate hyperplasia correlated more with re- than with primary stenosis and was due to increased density of smooth muscle cells (median cell density:
As a key finding of this study, hypercellular residual tissue showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Ultrastructural studies interestingly showed a significantly lower proportion of intimate plaque cells, particularly smooth muscle cells, with distinkant morphological characteristics for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
In the incidence of necrosis, however, there was no difference between both plaque types (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/cell;
In this way, our data point to apoptosis and not necrosis as an underlying cell death form with differences between both types of lesion with significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich remains.
The available findings suggest that reduced apoptosis constitutes an important mechanism of regulation that results in intimate hyperplasia, as is usually shown in human remains after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic Lymphomes are peripheral T and Naturaliller cell lymphomas that can manifest either primary or secondary in the skin.
cytotoxic lymphocytes follow a detailed description of clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of acute cytotoxic Lymphomes.
The current incidence of microbial (infectious) endocarditis (IE) is to be assumed with seven cases of illness per 100,000 population per year and has been continuously increasing for years.
The forecast is essential for rapid diagnosis and the introduction of adequate therapy.
In the case of unconfirmed endocarditis suspected transesophageal echocardiography is essential in addition to the most diagnostic clinical examination.
Cultural-negative endocarditis requires either cessation of untargeted antibiotic therapy and testing of blood culture techniques used or the use of serological/molecular biology techniques to identify the causal pathogen.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with potent toxic effects are used.
Large (> 10 mm) vegetation at the mitral flap is associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, which usually constitutes a standalone surgical indication, especially if the minimum bacterial concentration of the cheapest antibiotic combination is greater than 2 μg/ml.
In the first three weeks after the manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolism is associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebrale embolism does not constitute contraindication against surgery with the heart lung machine when a primary cerebral bleeding is excluded by using a crane computer-tomogram and surgery is performed early before post-apoplectic blood-brain barrier disorder (< 72 hours).
A significant prognosis improvement due to early surgical intervention is also evidenced for illnesses that are complicated by myocardial insufficiency (especially in the wake of acute flap failure), by the occurrence of acute renal failure, a rash infection of primary aortic flap vegetations on the front coral sail or a more than 48 hours of persistent sepsis despite antibiotic therapy.
The embryonic brain can be investigated particularly well with transvaginal ultrasound, as the large, "cystic" brain ventriculars can be photographed relatively easily.
Sonoembryology describes not only normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of malformations.
2. Modified appearance of cerebral ventriculars with disproportionate of the brain sections in which you find either an increased or a reduced amount of fluid.
4. Improperity of the contours of the back.
The Infection Protection Act provides a new basis for the system of reporting diseases in Germany.
Both certain symptoms of illness are reported in the event of suspicion, illness or death (in essence by doctors) and laboratory diagnostics of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates what information must be provided by the reporting authorities with the notification.
It also specifies which information may be transmitted by the health office.
In the case of suspected reports or the notification of pathogen proofs, not all information subject to transmission will always be available through the notification, so the health office must itself conduct investigations in such cases to be able to provide the corresponding information.
The health offices are also responsible for bringing the incoming reports from doctors and laboratories together and transmitting them as individual messages.
For this, case definitions have been developed. The Robert Koch Institute also provides an electronic definition of data, which facilitates the compilation of information required for transferring information to the health office.
The transfer to the RKI will then be done through the competent state authority designated by the country.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there is an increase in the number of tumours and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, nearly 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of malignancy.
Cancer sufferers usually suffer from a large number of physical and mental dysfunctions that lead to a significant loss of quality of life in the event of inadequate or missing treatment.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly serious effects on patients and their relatives.
Although there are therapy concepts for sufficient pain therapy from various organisations, these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
Therefore, pain therapy is a crucial cornerstone in palliative medicine.
Due to the central importance of the liver as a synthesis site of essential haemostase components and their functional role in the retikoendothelial system, liver disease results in laboratory-analyzed levels of hepatic synthesized haemostase factors and signs of increased plasma clotting and fibrinolysis.
In the case of compensated haemostase disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic therapy of haemostase disorder.
If this labile condition is further disturbed by various noxies, clinically usually bleeding with more or less consumable coagulitis or hyperfibrinolysis-like findings constellation and only exceptionally thromboembolism occurs.
Avoid astigmatism induction after seamless coronal cataractchirugy.
In the context of fall prevention, a routine review of medication is required, among other things.
A random sample of 276 over 75-year-old hospital patients examined how frequently medicines are prescribed, which can increase the risk of falling through the potential trigger of dizziness.
Between the individual heart centers, the amount of bleeding varies up to 8 times from the same median drainage after heart surgery in adults.
Excess follow-up results in increased blood transfusion rates in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce the perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed.
By avoiding preoperative anemia, tolerance of low haemoglobin, the use of autologous blood and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol, the use of allogeneous transfusions is reduced.
The perioperative maintenance and rapid restoration of the normothermal system significantly improves haemostase.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent subject at European level depends on its inclusion in the European Union's medical directives.
Mund-Kiefer face surgeons in the EU have achieved this goal with a strong commitment and with great efforts in 1989.
The UEMS section on Stomatology and Mund-Kiefer Face Surgery was the forum for the discussion of the factual problems among the representatives of the Member States and the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to its work, MKG surgery is recognized as an independent area of expertise in 11 European countries with about 3800 specialists at the end of the 20th century.
The emergence of otomycose, particularly after local antibiotic therapy, is not rare.
However, a deportation of mushrooms into the central ear can lead to serious complications.
Preoperatively, the outer ear canal must be refurbished.
All anti-mycotic ear drops currently available on the market do contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous miconazole solution.
Three comparative solutions, "E 153" (3), a full electrolyte solution for i. v. infusion, as well as Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), 2 balanced solutions for surgical interventions on the eye, have been reviewed for their potential impact on postoperative inflammation after cataract texturing.
From February 1991 to May 1998, a cardiovascular/defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 340 patients.
The average age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 female.
As a basic cardiac disease, 60% had coronary heart disease and 31% had dilatative cardiomyopathy.
Ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
Indication for an implantable cardiovascular/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia at 57% and survived reanimation in chamber fibrillation at 43%.
In 298 patients, a single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted, in 42 patients an AV sequential or two-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted.
In 25 patients, the implantation of a subcutaneous patch or array system was performed and in 2 patients of an epicardial patch system, in 92 patients, the place of implantation was abdominal and 248 pectoral.
33 patients (9.7%) experienced a total of 34 heart-related complications.
18 of the patients with an abdominal complication had an abdominal aggregation, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with abdominal aggregation.
In patients with a pectoral aggregator, the rate of heart-related complications was three times higher for two-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators at 12% than for single-chamber cardioverters/defibrillators at 4% (p = 0.05).
In more than half of patients (55%), the diagnosis was primarily based on routine X-ray testing, with a quarter (24%) clinical (inadequate therapy doses, pain) and a fifth (21%) based on electrical parameters.
The effectiveness of radiosynoviorthesis was studied in the therapy of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, particularly chronic polyarthritis.
In contrast to conventional computer tomography (CT), an X-ray does not rotate mechanically around the patient in electron beam tomography (EBT), but an electron beam is directed on semicircularly around the patient, where the actual X-ray is then formed.
With this ultra-fast technique, it has become possible to produce axial cutting images of the heart at 50 and 100 ms respectively and to accurately map all the structures of the heart with a place resolution <0.5 mm2.
Acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered cut images (layer thickness 2-3 mm) in short breathlessness allows the complete, three-dimensional image of a patient's heart.
Proof of coronary alkaline with the EBT must be regarded as the most emphatic non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for assessing the course after angioplasty and aortic bypass surgery.
The key problems and limitations of the method can be seen on condition of a stable sinus rhythm in respiratory and movement artefacts, as well as the transfer of coronary arteries through veins and through pronounced coronary qualifications.
Nevertheless, clinically assessable, non-invasive representations of coroners have already become possible with the EBT, which may be optimized by further technical progress.
The use of the Arteria thoracica interna for coronary revascularization has established itself as a vessel of choice in the past 25 years.
In addition to the established procedure of angiography, in recent years, duplexsonography has increasingly been used as a non-invasive imaging method for investigating this vessel.
In the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, a consistent result was found compared to angiography in a high proportion of patients.
While in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile is dominated by a high systolic proportion according to the arterial supply of a skeleton muscle, postoperative adjustment to the coronary arterial current bed results in increased diastolic flow.
These non-invasive findings of transthoracal duplex sonography could be confirmed by invasive intravascular doppler measurements.
As with preoperative comparison, a high degree of consistency between angiography and duplexsonography results in the evaluation of the revascularization result.
In view of the increasing use of the arteria thoracica interna as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly important.
Dissektions of peripheral arteries particularly affect male hypertensive patients aged over 60, who characteristically exhibit cystic medianectosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmic ciphers of intracranial arteries are a pronounced rarity.
This is where young patients with or without immediate trauma outweigh prehistoric history.
In the light of a case of traumatic dissection of the A. cerebri media in a 7-year-old girl, the etiology, pathogenesis, symptomaticism and morphological findings of aneurysmic ciphers of intracranial arteries are discussed taking into account the cases described in literature.
The contribution shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adjustment of old and care homes.
The adjustment is aimed at increasing the customer orientation of the homes, profiling their core competencies and forging the management of the core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposed ideal models, but it is up to the management bodies to develop and enforce home-specific solutions taking into account the respective framework conditions.
It is reported that a phenotypically female newborn of the 37th SSW died under the picture of renal failure on the 14th day of life.
The child showed a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and an unusually pronounced, diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic studies ensured the diagnosis of Drash syndrome.
Since the late 60s, accidents in Western industrialized nations have been among the most common causes of childish morbidity and mortality.
While accidents in older children and adolescents usually occur in road traffic and are consistently recorded or documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infant and toddler age that prefer to occur in domestic activities.
As part of a study on the effectiveness of a cellular pertussisvakzine, between 1991 and 1994, we were able to survey and analyze the frequency of accidental hospitalizations in 10,271 infants and young children in Germany.
There are 2 cases (female, 37 and 47) of sacred intradural arachnoid cysts that had caused a long-standing lumbalgiform complaint.
In both cases, mication disorder was present in the sense of pollakisury.
Both cysts were complete and had no communication with the other subarachnoidal space.
The imaging magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) can prove the passage of the blood enriched with contrast agents through the heart muscle and even enables a quantitative evaluation of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical use of this method is delayed on the one hand by the difficulty of the image evaluation, on the other hand by the fact that conventional techniques can only show one layer per heartbeat.
New developments in both core spinographs and accelerated image capture strategies allow the assessment of perfusion across the entire heart muscle with a resolution of 2 mm.
As an example of such imaging technique, a rapid gradient echoplanar sequence segmented (130 ms per image) is discussed with the preceding saturation pulse and results presented in an infarction patient.
The clinical benefit of the MRI-assisted identification of perfusion for the diagnosis of coronary diseases is reinforced by the multiplicity of MRI methods for determining heart function parameters.
Since the blood circulation conditions for ruptures constitute an essential parameter in particular regarding the chances of success of surgical care, the vascularization of the knee ligament should be shown in this thesis.
The specific circulation situation was studied by microangiography on 21 bodies.
There was a proximal supply of 1 or 2 main vessel strains, which were preferred in the ventral band proportions.
The vascular density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
Given the lower vascularization of the distal band proportions, we would recommend band reconstruction by fibrillation, which allows an atrucmatic restoration without the risk of seam-related vascular strangulation.
Every year, around 75000 patients with coronary heart disease (approximately 75% of all heart surgery) are treated surgically in Germany.
Arterial grafts and autologist veins, mainly the Vena saphena magna, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive vein removal techniques revolutionize bypass surgery, but today the sephenectomy is largely done through continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin for the open preparation of the Vena saphena magna.
Wound healing disorders after open saphenectomy are repeatedly discussed and are the subject of any heart surgery after coronary surgery and the reason for the upgrading of new, minimally invasive withdrawal techniques.
The presented technique (modified "bridge" technique) shows desired results, in particular a very high patient satisfaction regarding the cosmetic outcome and the limited limitation of the sapphireectomy wound(s).
Poland syndrome is characterised by one-sided malformation in the area of the ventral thoracic wall with aplasia of the sternocostal proportion of the M. pectoralis major, a ipsilateral symbroydactyly, and occasionally associated other defects of the Thorax wall, Mamille and Mamma.
According to us, a total of seven cases of the common occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been described so far.
We report another patient with this rare combined malformation.
In this study, sICAM-1 and sE-selectin levels should be examined to predict an imminent sepsis and the severity of sepsis early on.
The range of ophthalmological journals in the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very comprehensive.
However, the online offers of different magazines and publishers are very different in quality and quantity.
In contrast to traditional publications, online publications offer many advantages, such as low production costs and rapid, location and time-independent availability of the information.
It can be assumed that the online publications will not replace the print versions but constitute a useful addition to the previous information.
We report a 61-year-old patient who had come to the rare form of sheer lateral elbow luxury after a "police grip."
The present casing shows the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a second aortoenteral fission type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after implanting an aortic tube prosthesis.
The surgery was performed by top endoscopy and abdominal computer tomography.
The value of pr-operative diagnostics and the 2 alternative surgical procedures, in-situ reconstruction and extra-anatomic revascularization will be discussed.
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not performed in Germany.
The Embryon Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics, according to opponents of the PGD in Germany.
Advocates believe that under a certain legal perspective, the embryo protection law would not be contrary to a PGD.
Against the backdrop of this situation, a PGD has not been carried out in Germany so far.
The discussion, which has been fiercely held in Germany for a long time, is difficult to convey in scientific circles abroad.
Due to casuistics, it was suggested that the muscle-relaxing potency of atracurium is reduced when an intrathoracal herd is present.
In a prospective, clinical investigation, this hypothesis should be reviewed.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined the fever of unclear genes (FUO) as a disease that develops over three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C on at least three days, which remains ambiguous even after a week of inpatient explanation.
A quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most often due to hidden abscesses, endocarditis lenta and tuberculosis.
This thesis presents the profile geometry, a modern method for determining the skin surface structure.
With the help of a fast-hardening plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measuring area, impressions are produced of the skin that correspond to their negative image.
In the following measurement technique, the "roughness" of the skin imprint is measured with the "Profilometer" and the result is recorded as a diagram.
Using a statistical program, the measuring data can be analyzed, stored and compared.
We tested this method to demonstrate possible improvements in skin surface texture after the application of oestrogenic creams in the face.
Summary The distribution ratio of the water between serum and whole blood has been set at 1.2 in the guidelines for blood alcohol determination for forensic purposes for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol.
In an extensive multicentre study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the circle of people, where blood collections are ordered in connection with alcoholic offences, a mean distribution factor of 1.16 was measured with extremes of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of cases, the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19. Regarding the average, the quotient difference in 96% of cases is less than 3%.
Paradoxic embryos are well known in theory, but rarely in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right-to-left pressure and consecutive right-left shunt through an open foramen is typically based on oval or a forecourteptum defect.
Polymorphic disease images of children changing during growth through reinnervation, lexusch surgery and replacement surgery are hard to classify.
A significant comparison of the different forms of therapy is only possible through the use of generally recognised evaluation standards.
The vascular injuries were diagnosed after clinical delivery by palpation of wrist pulses, clinical evaluation of vascularity and by dissipating the doppler signal via wrist arteries.
The emergency surgery in all 10 children involved fragment repositioning and fixation in the first step with cross-sectional K wires via a stretchy access.
The subsequent evaluation of circulation revealed a pulse recurrence in 2 of the 10 children (passager, dislocated vessel closure).
In 8 of the 10 children, the pulse remained away, which is why the vessel had to be explorated.
Intraoperatively, we saw a vascular spasm with functional vascular closure in 1 of these 8 children.
In the case of adventitious strangulations (2 of these 5 children), the pulse transfer to the hand occurred immediately after the binding tissues were separated.
In the case of intima damage (3 of these 5 children), the affected vessel section was reconstructed and reconstructed, usually in the form of primary end-to-end anaesthesia with vein patchplasty.
We saw a combined vessel closure (mechanical-functional closure) in 2 of these 8 children.
During the follow-up, the wrist pulses could be scanned in 9 children, 9 children had a physiological signal, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal above the A. brachialis, A. radialis and A. ulnaris.
None of the children were ashamed of any later damage (cold intolerance, Klaudikatio, Volkmann contract).
The assessment of elbow joint mobility revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees), and a side-like, normal pro and supination.
The supportive joint axis was normal in all children compared to the sides.
The cultural evidence of Bordetella pertussis is a little helpful for pediatricians, as pathogens can only be grown at 30-60% of cough patients and the result is at the earliest after 3-5 days.
Regional deep hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep tumours.
In a randomized, double-blind parallel group comparison, the effectiveness and tolerability of high dose vitamin E (3x400mg RRR--tocopherolacetate/d) was assessed against diclofenac sodium (3x50mg/d) in stationary patients with secure chronic polyarthritis.
After a three-week treatment, a significant improvement in all clinical parameters was observed in both vitamin E therapy (n=42) and diclofenac treatment (n=43).
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90min to 68min under vitamin E therapy, with diclofenac intake from 68min to 30min.
The joint index according to Ritchie declined from 56 to 46 (Vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (Diclofenac).
The grip thickness increased in both the vitamin E group and the Diclofenac group.
Similarly, a significant reduction in the severity of pain was observed in both groups, assessed by a 10cm visual analog scale.
The overall judgement of the doctor and patient on the success of the therapy was similarly positive for the two medicines.
In the light of the risk profile of NSAR in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, taking high-dose vitamin E is a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be air-filled or even overblown if there is a fission to the oesophagus or stomach.
Such an observation is shown in the newborn.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary frontal darmanoma.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystical lung processes.
The diagnosis can be preoperatively secured by an oesophagus porridge and by dopplersonography.
Within a few weeks, a 24-year-old type I diabetist repeatedly got into severe diabetic ketoaziosis (serumbicarbonate 7.4 and 4.3 mmol/l) as part of intoxications with synthetic drugs ("Ecstasy" and "Speed").
In the case of decompensated diabetic metabolism (HbA1c initial 11.7%), insulin injections were not affected.
In addition, the patient had danced for hours while manifesting the first ketoaziosis without adequate fluid intake at a techno party.
The clinical picture showed peritonitic symptoms alongside excise and tachycardia;
Disorders of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and persecution are mainly related to drug intoxication.
The therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte and insulin substitution.
The gradients were straightforward.
A case of ball variance of a smeloff cutter prosthesis in an aortic position is reported 24 years after implantation.
Following previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiovascular shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed a pronounced degeneration with yellow coloration, groove and crack formation in swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in terminal prosthesis impairment with complete thrombosis of the flap.
As part of a prospective study, 36 patients were treated outpatiently for osteochondrosis dissecans of the talus roll and controlled after 4 and 12 months in accordance with a standardized protocol.
It was shown that the conventional radiological preliminary investigation allowed a statement about the stage of osteochondrosis and its localisation.
Although over half of the herds were in the dorsal sections of the talus, they could be reached without ankleosteotomy, piercing the tibia or distraction.
Arthroscopy also enables partial synovectomy in companion synovectomy and removal of osteophytes on the tibia front edge.
The low complication rate, the short duration of rehabilitation and the objective and subjectively good surgical result make the arthroscopy a serious alternative to the arthrotomy of the upper ankle.
Acute heart failure, in addition to decompensated chronic heart failure, includes acute cardiovascular edema and cardiovascular shock.
The former must be treated with relatively low therapeutic effort, while it is already larger in lung edema.
In addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used.
Nevertheless, the mortality of a cardiac shock, the cause of which cannot be treated, is >85%.
In a double-blind study in 31 subjects, cognitive performance disorders were quantified by using a standardized and validated test procedure (SKT) after one-off oral absorption of a therapeutic dose of 15 mg midazolam.
The disorders were partly in line with the clinical picture of moderate to severe through syndrome or organic psychotherapy.
In addition, all subjects experienced complete anterograde amnesia without brightening.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly apparent by the proof of a coarse rotary nystagm, which was extended in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the first 3 to 6 hours after midazolam intake.
Presentation of the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions through internet technology for image and findings distribution and video conference applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems enables a very good representation of the extracranial carotid current trajectory in magnetic resonanzangiography (MRA) and is used in the clinical routine.
With the preferred time-of-flight (TOF) technique, vessels can be represented without contrast agents.
The use of ultra-fast gradient echo sequences (GES) enables a first-pass display of the carotids from the aortic arch to the skull base in less than 30 s measurement time for intravenous bolus injection of gdolinium.
This thesis discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast-assisted MRA (CE-MRA), consideration must be given to the correct time of the quantity and flow rate of contrast medium (KM) injection and the matching of sequence parameters to the relatively rapid blood return from the venous sinus to the Vv. jugulares.
At first, the optimal time of data acquisition regarding the presence of KM in the arteries was determined on a model and in a computer simulation.
It was shown that 90% of the contrast is defined in the average 16% of symetrically acquired k room lines.
By progressive variation of local resolution, measurement time and KM injection parameters, a measuring protocol was developed for subjects and some patients, which enables the clinical use of CE-MRA in the area of extracranial carotid current trajectory.
The best quality results were achieved with a double dose technique at 2 ml/s injection speed.
The temporal reserves of ultra-fast sequences should be invested in improving resolution.
Further investigations into the optimal KM application are still pending.
Various pre-, intra- and postoperative measures are used to prevent this complication.
Preoperative measures include the delay of the surgical appointment until the end of the inflammatory phase after initial trauma, a preoperative health gym program, and an appropriate patient selection and explanation.
Intraoperative measures include the exact placement of the drilling channels including an arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of transplantation vaccination.
Furthermore, too large transplantation tension must be avoided at the time of tibial transplantation fixation.
The postoperative measures include the immediate passive fracture of the knee joint, the early onset of a movement program and regular clinical checks.
From the experience of the clinic, the development of arthrofibrosis can be largely avoided after surgery on the front cruciate cruciate ligament, taking into account the actions mentioned.
In the context of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for the palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasia, surgical therapy options are essential.
The focus is on restoring passage, ensuring secretion and reducing pain.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic processes are isolated or used in combination with the integration of all conservative therapy options.
In many cases, unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization can be avoided.
This thesis describes and discusses the current surgical and endoscopic techniques for palliating patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in sick people is one of the most common and least considered illnesses in hospitals, care homes or domestic care.
Depending on the type and composition of the studied patient group, prevalence of malnutrition is reported up to 60%.
This results in energy shortages, especially in times of increased energy demand, such as acute or chronic illness, combined with general malnutrition.
To accurately diagnose malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical dietary parameters.
These enable tailor-made dietary therapy.
The most important deficiency rates in sick people concern proteins, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition extends hospitalization, causes huge healthcare costs and comes with a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase in the number of people who have died, the problem of malnutrition will intensify.
More attention should therefore be paid to malnutrition by taking it seriously as a standalone disease and being integrated into the curriculum of training doctors and care staff.
The multivariate Hazard analysis according to Cox identifies the ELND as an independent prognosis factor alongside tumour thickness (Breslow) (alternative pT category), tumour location and gender of the tumour carrier.
In the Stratification according to the above forecast parameters, the "observed survival curves" differ significantly from each other according to Kaplan Meier "with" and "without ELND" in the following risk groups:
Women with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on the head, neck, chest and acronyms;
Men with >1.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the same localization as well as >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on the arms, legs and abdomen (apart from acral and genital localization).
The limits of the risk range with predictive benefits can be further clarified by testing concrete risk constellations taking into account additional parameters for the indication position.
Driving permit applicants require not only an adequate vision, but also, legally, their "reliable use".
The nystagmus patient strives for this by taking, for example, a head-to-view coercion or using other compensation mechanisms.
However, these are not allowed to him in accordance with the applicable investigative guidelines (Appendix XVII, §§ 9 a ff. StVZO).
Eruptive Vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retinated Vellus hair in children and young adults.
A 23-year-old patient with symptomless comedic papals is reported in the face, neck and chest.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts found in the middle corium with obtained strategic granulosum, centrally retinated keratine and numerous Vellushaare.
Despite some common clinical characteristics, eruptive Vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex differ histopathologically and thus represent standalone symptoms.
Bazillary angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease, which is mostly found in HIV-infected patients.
Using molecular biology, both rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana were identified as potential pathogens.
The bacteria can be represented histologically by warthin starry coloration or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was marked by acutely or subcutaneously located, e.g. ulcerated nodes.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bone, liver or spleen may also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with a BA in which multiple cutaneous nodes as well as noxious changes were present.
Treatment with erythromycin led to a re-education of all symptoms of illness.
In 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries, stabilization and spondylodesis of the ventral column were performed in thoracic technique.
Experience increased operating times significantly.
At the beginning of the series, 2 patients converted to an open procedure.
Its own experience shows the fundamental feasibility of a minimally invasive supply.
Essential advantages over the open method are reduced access morbidity, reduced painkiller needs, early functional recovery and a shortened inpatient stay.
Operational objective Exercise stable osteosynthesis of humerus with solid, intramedullary locking nails in non-drilled technology.
A mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to a narrowing of the subacrural space is considered a possible cause of supraspinatus-outlet syndrome.
The aim of this study was to develop a method for the improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and to assess the acromion form in three-dimensionally reconstructed computer tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal cuts and compared on the healthy and sick side.
The acromion form was compared to the classification according to Bigliani in the conventional X-ray.
The concept of primary chronic osteomyelitis summarizes various symptoms that should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often bacterial, no pathogen can be shown in the 2nd group.
Especially the multifocal forms (chronic recurring multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to the relapsed, long course and may also show skin participation (SAPHO syndrome).
Biopsy is primarily used for the exclusion of tumours and material extraction for bacterial analysis.
There are no histological distinctions between these chronic osteomyelitis forms.
Social ageing is not per se justified in a demographically ageing society, but must demonstrate its societal usefulness in the changing circumstances of age structure change.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding demand according to professional orientation and in the areas of action of the social old age work the search for a more consensual and attractive performance profile triggered.
With the method of direct immunofluorescence, we managed to detect linear deposits of IgG-lambda-L chains, an early component of the C1q complement and discrete C3 deposits along the obtained elastic fibres in the dermis, particularly in the strategic papillare, at the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and sebum glands and in the walls of the small vessels.
In this context, our case can be considered unique in literature.
The hand is extraordinarily exposed in daily use and thus also exposed to high levels of injury.
In addition to vitality and sensitivity, the diverse functions of the hand require undisturbed motor and stability.
In the event of serious injuries, only residual or replacement functions are very common.
The complex trauma of the hand results in a combined, extended damage to the soft tissues and the ankle skeleton with acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
Basically, a comprehensive initial care is sought.
Due to the multiple damage, an extended débridement is the focus.
The destroyed tissues are primarily reconstructed as far as possible.
The microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves follows.
In the case of exposed bones or tendons, the skin coat is replaced by a stalked or free microchirugic skin flap.
For a long time, this concept is derived from this concept so that circulation is restored.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are clearly presented.
With the healing result of a complex hand injury, every recovered or created function counts the hand.
It is therefore not responsible to provide a special department without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local requirements.
Treatment of symptomatic coronary multi-valve disease with balloon dilatation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible according to the results of 5 large randomized studies with comparable clinical success and risk.
However, according to PTCA, the number of reinterventions is much higher.
In the long run, after the BARI study in diabetic patients, lethality in the surgical group was lower.
The individual therapy recommendation by the treating doctor has also proved to be an important factor in the patient’s prediction.
The impact of newer techniques (stents) is currently under investigation in further large-scale randomized studies.
A 34-year-old patient with the rare disease of parakeratosis variegata is reported after a period of 4 years following a Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta.
In order to investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship between these diseases from the group of parapsoriasis changes and regarding their relationship with the low malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the T cell type, we performed histological, immunohistochemical and molecular analyses.
While both diseases had characteristic histological changes and a predominant lymphocyte epidermotropic T cell filament, monoclonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor could not be secured within both changes.
Thus, we interpret both diseases as their own entities and in this case without reference to the low malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the T cell type.
A histological statement about the location of a tumor-suspected lesion in the biopsy and its relationship with the resective edge (R 0 or R 1) must be as accurate and undoubted as possible.
We report on 2 technical tools that, according to our experience, are particularly useful for mammals:
1) Radiopake threads, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsat.
When contacting sevoflurane with the CO2 absorbers of the narcose circuit parts, Compound A arises, which may have nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have been carried out recently in volunteers to analyse the effects of compound A on renal function.
A total of three studies in subjects explored the effects of 8-hour narcosis with a sevoflurane concentration of 3 Vol.%, using fresh gas flows of approximately 2 L/min each.
The first published study of Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from the renaltubulus cells in the urine of the subjects after sevoflurane.
The following studies then found either not relevant or even no changes in the renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined 3 Vol.% sevoflurane in subjects who had been administered for 4 hours with a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
In transferring these results to clinical practice, the experimental nature of the narcotics performed in these studies must be taken into account in any case.
Although the subject of low-fluid narcose is still controversially discussed with sevoflurane, the studies in volunteers, as well as the results of new clinical studies, suggest that renal function behaves similarly after surgical interventions in low-fluid conditions as per isoflurane.
Until now, there are no published experiences in the therapy of paraphilia (pedophiles, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse acts with LHRH (leasing hormone) agonists.
In this investigation, we describe 11 patients treated with LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate in a period of 12 months.
In the treatment period, there was no further sexually aggressive activity and, according to patients, a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urge conditions and fantasies.
One patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists, combined with other therapeutic methods, seem to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its potential carcinogenic effects.
Therefore, we examined five different intraoperative heat measures for their effectiveness.
Baker and his employees first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the Ultrapulse CO2 laser, an advanced device is available that enables other applications in ophthalmology.
Diagnostics of thrombosis in peripheral veins is now possible through both phlebography and duplex sonography with almost 100% safety.
It is tied to the high qualification of the investigator.
In Germany, both procedures are fully available.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnostics, but due to their lack of invasiveness, duplexsonography has gained outstanding significance.
When it comes to specific questions, phlebography must not be missed.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication of phlebography.
In many institutions, the application of the two procedures is practiced as a "gold partnership" when it comes to comprehensive documentation.
The chronic repellent response today represents the most important still unsolved problem of kidney transplant.
The aim of the present study was to clarify whether the transplantation results in reendothelialization or reepithelialization by extrarenal cells or if the transplantation remains allogeneous.
Against this background, we studied 9 grafts of against-sex donors using non-radioactive in-situ hybridization (NISH).
In another step, mono and polyclonal antibodies were used against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, actin, factor VIII and UEA to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in transplantationvasculopathy.
Our study showed that several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells maintained the donor’s gender.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplantation were the inflammation cells composed mainly of T-lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, the dopplersonographic finding of cerebral circulatory breastfeeding was recognized as one of the shortening methods for the final diagnosis of the brain death by the Scientific Advisory Council of the Federal Medical Chamber.
A survey should clarify the extent to which dopplersonography has been used in this context since and what experience has been gained.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurologists (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments of Germany.
In 71 departments, dopplersonography is also used in the sense of decision-making aids to determine brain death, usually in conjunction with other methods.
When asked if false positive findings were found, 5 times "yes" were ticked.
The meeting revealed that the investigators were aware of border situations where, at times, the conditions were not fully met.
In none of these cases was the ultrasonic test used to determine the brain death.
Dopplersonography is used by a non-essential number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory breastfeeding and as a decision-making tool for the diagnosis of the brain death, mainly to further safeguard the diagnosis, rarer than alone, the waiting time shortening method.
For the endogenous formation of CO is exclusively responsible for microscopic haemoxygenase (HO), which is present as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) as well as in an inducible isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32).
In this thesis, the organ-specific expression pattern of the strand inducible isoform of the enzyme after haemorrhagic shock and volume therapy was examined.
Glycerin results in the conversion of crystalline lipid structures in the horn layer lipids into fluid crystalline states.
It improves horn layer hydration particularly when used in O/W emulsion to a significant and significantly above the urea effect.
It also promotes the resolution of dismosomes in the upper layers of the horn layer and thus the horn layer relief.
Especially for long-term applications, the deformation of the skin in the suction test can be reinforced by glycerin.
The roughness of the skin surface is also influenced by glycerin-containing preparation in the sense of smoothing.
Glycerin also protects against surfactant and lipophilic pollutants when used in O/W emulsions.
This may be due to the hygroscopic effect of glycerine, which results in a Flux from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, glycerine may lead to an improvement in drug penetration similar to urine.
Operational objective Operational objective Stabilization of back shoulder instability in adolescents through a back bone block and a capsule plastic.
Complications of the long-term history resulting from the degeneration of venous grafts can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to extended surgical times and increased surgical trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have only been used in exceptions so far.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletalization of arterial conduits/T-graph configuration).
Materials and methods:
Between 3/96 and 7/99, 405 patients with coronary multi-vascular disease were completely revascularized in our clinic.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletal grafts, in 105 patients (25.9%) bilateral artery thoracicae internae, in 299 patients (73.58%) Arteria thoracica interna and radial artery, and in 1 patient (0.3%) 1 radical artery.
In 346 patients (85.4%), the two arterial grafts were implanted in T configuration.
In the mean, 4.1 +/- 0.9 coronary vessels per patient were anastomosized.
Hospitality was 2%.
Starvation disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
Complications after taking radial artery were not observed except for temporary paresthesia.
In angiographic control 1 week postoperative, 96.7% of coronerastomoses were free from stenoses >50%.
The complete arterial bypass surgery with the use of skeletal arteries and the T-Graft technique is a safe procedure for the therapy of coronary multi-valve disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow for routine use.
The different treatment procedures for periprosthetic thigh fracture after endoprothetic replacement of the knee joint are discussed.
A new method of supplying such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS (LISS, Synthese) is described and first clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has obtained a key position within neuromonitoring, although the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron cannot be registered directly or only in time.
Requirements for reliable brain pressure measurement are specific characteristics of brain pressure probes to be examined in the following.
These are to be analysed and categorized from a measurable point of view in order to gain a better understanding of their different functioning and measuring properties.
Partial sphincterectomy is practiced in cataract surgery in very tight pupillary (< 3 mm).
We assume that the tight pupilla is mainly conditioned by a fibrosis ring of the M. sphincter pupillae.
While the health-related quality of life of adults is increasingly researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
In this thesis, work published in literature on the health-related quality of life of children is evaluated with regard to priorities and methods of research.
The overview shows that empirical work has so far been rare, the existing measuring tools for the quality of life of children are described.
Reinforced research activities are necessary to detect the quality of life of children in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were recorded during the last 5 days prior to the onset of acute renal failure and compared to a control group.
Due to skin changes that must be considered as starting rhinophyme due to the present biographical material, Andy Warhol underwent a dermabrasio in 1957.
Throughout his entire stage of artistic creation, an artist’s work with aspects of plastic surgery can be demonstrated particularly in the nose area.
As a founder of the pop art, Warhol has significantly influenced the modern society with his entire work and has also influenced our claims for aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the program HepaVision (MEVIS, Bremen) developed specifically for 3D liver visualization was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extended liver sections and liver liver liver donations.
Experience with the program has so far been available for >50 volume data sets of biphasic spiral CCT investigations.
After active unspecific immunotherapy has had an adjuvant and palliative effect on the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It includes gene transfer that can be done viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma we offer:
Vacancy with tumour-specific, HLA-associated antigens by peptides or "naked DNA," vacancy with melanoma cells transfected with cytoking or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with in vitro propagated specific T cells, transfected tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells in vivo with tumour suppression, whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The impact of distortionary tendencies on the evaluation of therapy results has not yet been accurately assessed.
At 309 patients treated with conversational psychotic therapy in hospital and patients examined a year later, it is shown to the extent to which raters in the CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES scales can be influenced by patients' defensive attitudes measured with validity scales of the personality tests MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gießen test:
the tendency to put yourself in a favourable light ("social desirability"), and the tendency to appear inconspicuous-normal.
Their relative improvements (effectual strengths of ratings) are less severe to the extent to which their openness increases (validity scales). - Stationary conversational psychotherapy strengthened defense in aggravating and reduced them in dissimulating patients.
Despite early conservative and then timely surgical therapy of the congenital clumpfoot adapted to the severity of deformity, approximately 25% relapses and residual deformities are reported.
The main cause seems to be the lack of concentrated reposition and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
The most common deformity is forefoot reduction and supination.
The age-dependent surgical procedure is presented from the experience of 94 operating relapse/residual lumps (patients < 10 years).
Beyond the age of 8th to 10th, middle-footosteotomies, correction after Ilizarov with the fixater externally and as an ultima ratio the triplearthrodese are used.
Nävuszellnävi show a pronounced variability of their clinical morphs.
We report a 77-year-old patient with a stalked, lobulary, intradermal Nävuszellnävus on the hull.
For this traubular appearance we propose the expression "Nävus corymbiformis".
For ethical and socioeconomic reasons (cost explosion in transfusions, patients’ fate), the advancement and consistent use of non-blood-saving measures in medicine represents a challenge for anaesthetists, surgeons and transfusion doctors.
The combination of various processes, such as preoperative intraoperative blood donation, preoperative haemodilution, choice of anaesthesia, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics and machine autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, allow patients with large intraoperative blood loss to save the transfusion of allogeneous blood.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kieler Gebärhaus and the Midwife's School, is considered one of the founders of scientific birth medicine.
He studied research and teaching at the empirical level.
His main work on the narrow pelvis summarises his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determination of the pelvis dimensions and inspection of the Michaelis-Raute named after him provided him with a safe forecast of risks of birth.
His research was distinguished by his honesty and conscience:
He self-critically published medical failures, critically examining new theories.
For the first time in Germany, he confirmed the teaching of Semmelweis for the prevention of puerperal fever.
As a result of the death of many patients in the child's bed, he died in 1848.
In one case, the tumour is likely to be responsible for a long-standing pathogen pipeline disorder (AV block) and for sudden death entry.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can trigger temporary irritation in humans in encrypted cortex areas.
New applications for functional anatomic questions about speechlateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Due to theoretical considerations and previous experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations for safety of application are given.
Neurinomas of the N. facialis are rare, benign tumours that usually occur in the course of the distal intratemporal section of the nerve, pre-grow after extratemporal and then become extracranially noticed as space demand.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral fazialisparesis.
The patient complained of diffuse dizziness, a progressive sound sensation disorder on the left and a slight peripheral fazialisparesis with no deficit of tear secretion.
The neurinoma was detected by computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance tomography (MRI).
Using an extradural "middle fossa approach," the tumour was removed without injury to motor N. facialis.
This is the first report of an isolated neurinoma of the N. petrosus major without affection of the motor nerve facialis.
A status epilepticus (SE) is present if there is continuous seizure or multiple seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, the current treatment strategies are based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
Initial treatment is done with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients, phenytoin and phenobarbital are used for insufficient success.
The therapie-refractory SE has a poor forecast and must be treated at a specialized intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the most appropriate approach is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are alternatively applicable effective substances.
For the therapy of an outdated rupture of the tendon of the M. tibialis anterior, either tendon transposition or tendon transplant is recommended.
On the basis of a case study, the surgical supply of an augmented reverse plastic is described;
3 years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively trouble-free with good functional outcome.
The reverse plastic has the advantage that there is no functional loss compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance provides valuable information regarding forecasts and treatment strategies in many diseases.
For the detection of this parameter in intensive patients, the analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity are primarily used, which are well-defined and tested in large prospective studies.
The ventilation and cardiovascular chemoreflex sensitivities, however, as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and the prognosis of chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the statement of these symptoms.
Sepsis and MODS as particularly relevant for intensive care are also associated with an impairment of autonomous function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
The limitation of heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ("Uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems increasingly attractive in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report 3 patients with an acquired green coloration of the head hair.
The history revealed that all 3 patients regularly bathed in the private swimming pool.
The analysis of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed an excessively high copper content as the cause of green discoloration.
On the basis of our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic linkage of this exogenous hair coloration with the intake of copper by swimming water in-house swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different times after heart transplant (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific questionnaires, assessment of global quality of life, Munich quality of life dimension list (MLDL), expected or experienced changes according to HTx.
In the evaluation, individual measurements were shown by median (Me), average (M) and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of terminal heart-sufficient patients considered their quality of life very bad;
Already 6 weeks postoperatively, these parameters improved, and 74% of the transplants felt their quality of life was very good to excellent.
Patients were also very unhappy with the physical performance (87%) and the health condition (80%).
Six weeks after transplantation, these areas improved significantly, 76% of patients showed a high level of satisfaction with the health condition and 51% with physical performance.
Although patients considered their mental sensitivity to be good before HTx, these parameters improved postoperatively and achieved significantly higher levels (preop.
Range (R)=3,78 vs. 12 Mon. postop.
Quality of life was best correlated with the state of health before HTx (r=0.61, p<0,01), 6 months after transplantation best with satisfaction with the health condition (r=0.76, p<0,01).
According to HTx, the areas of sexuality, professional situation and recreational design improved only in about 28% of patients.
90% suffered from one or more symptoms after transplantation, mostly adverse reactions to immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal heart failure, 6 weeks after HTx, all areas of quality of life significantly improve with the exception of mental sensitivity.
Despite high expectations and postoperative discomfort, heart transplants are significantly more satisfied with their postoperative life situation.
A 36-year-old man suffered an insulated skull-brain trauma (SHT) with skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hemorrhage and contus bleeding [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The room-demanding hematomas were evacuated by crane.
High ICP values required a barbituratcoma over 10 days.
The patient developed septic lung failure on day 8 of trauma.
The patient showed a protracted course and could not be moved to neurorehabilitation until 57 days after the accident.
Following this, the patient developed a massive restriction of mobility in both hip joints (extension/flexion:
0 degree/10 degree/20 degree, left:
Abduction/Addition:
10 degree/0 degree/25 degree, left:
In the pelvis overview and computer tomography, ankylosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker type IV) were shown.
Two years after the accident, the HO were separated by a Smith-Petersen access.
HO recurrence prevention was achieved by one-time preoperative irradiation (8 Gy) and postoperative indomethacin (150 mg/day) for 3 months.
The movement mass on the hip joints is 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection as follows:
20 degree/0 degree/30 degree, left:
Abduction/adduction:
30 degree/0 degree/40 degree, left:
Radiologically, no recurrence of HO has been shown.
The patient may undergo slight activity as a farmer 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed.
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene that encodes for the small ribosome subunit (18S rRNA) of mushrooms.
PCR was used to amplify the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes, along with some yeast and mould mushrooms.
Hybridization with specific detectable oligonucleotides led to the identification of dermatophytes and candida albicans.
Restriction fragment analysis allowed the demarcation of dermatophytes towards yeast and mould mushrooms.
The specificity of the PCR for mushrooms was checked on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermis samples, as well as selected animal and plant-based DNA.
To assess the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were examined with the PCR and culture.
With the PCR, dermatophytes were detected in 35 and with the culture in 28 of the 38 positively rated patient samples.
The sensitivity of the PCR (92%) was higher than the culture (73%).
The result of this investigation shows that PCR has advantages over the culture when detecting dermatophytes.
Wrist arthrosis has helped to develop a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic area for radiocarpal and mediocardial inflections is the evaluation of kinematic stability.
Wristarthroscopy is crucial in this context alongside functional radiological procedures.
The injuries to the discus ulnaris and the skapholunary ligament are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
The analysis of mitochondrial DNA was increasingly used during the last decade in legal practice, archaeology and evolutionary and population genetic studies.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA with special consideration for non-coding hypervariable regions is described.
It also discusses the importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biological studies.
The forensic value of sequence databases as well as requirements for their scope and structure are explained.
Results of experimental work with the aim of collecting mitochondrial DNA from floor-bearing teeth, hair shavings and contaminated traces are shown.
Finally, three trace cases are presented, which could be determined using the mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the present work is to present the findings and observations reported in literature.
Microperimetric investigations after surgical extraction of chorioidaeal neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep skotome arises in the area of the resulting pigment epithet loss.
The surgical effort must be weighed against the possible functional results of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) with its high soft contrast is the imaging method of choice for displaying the intraarticular structures and the surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, Nativ MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labrum lesions of the hip joint.
The MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint enables direct presentation of labrum lesions through the distension of the joint space and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences allow for evaluation in crucial cranioventral sections.
Labrum lesions can be classified with the MRA into different clinically relevant stages.
In addition, it is also possible to display companion lesions (intra and extraossary ganglias, straddling oedema).
In a study conducted by us with surgically verified cases, the MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and meeting safety (91%).
No complications have been found in over 100 arthrographies.
Based on these experiences, the MRA represents the method of choice for imaging labrum lesions.
In this overview we present the technology and results of the MRA method we use.
It was revealed that the vein wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, of which the vein wall was also affected below an intact vein flap.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in the tensile strength was in the vein wall and here in particular on the components of the extracellular matrix.
The theory of primary flap degradation and the subsequent varicose remodelling of the vein cannot be confirmed in the summarization of mechanical tests and immunohistochemical results, which results in a change in the vein wall and thus also flap failure.
Artery injuries as a direct trauma result in bleeding or ischaemia.
In the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries, acute ischaemia may be missing.
Hypothenar-hammer syndrome represents a closure of distal A. ulnaris as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical start is usually sneaky and only a targeted duplexsonographic or angiographic examination results in diagnosis.
Proven therapy recommendations are not available.
Diagnosing the closure of the arteria ulnaris as an accident consequence is important for the patient and makes a therapy approach possible.
This study aims to review medium-term eye pressure regulation after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery.
The direct anti-emetic effect of propofol is already known.
Combinations of anaesthesia and anaesthesia with propofol results in total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to other anaesthesia medicines or techniques.
This article shows how best to exploit the advantage of the anti-emetic effect of propofol.
The potential effects of propofol on the cortex cerebri and its interaction with the dopamine and serotoninergic system are discussed through results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the pros and cons of Propofol are discussed regarding the incidence reduction of PONV in clinical practice.
Preoperative planning rarely involves predicting postoperative soft tissue aesthetics, combined with the extremely atrophic toothless upper jaw treatment of the extremely atrophic toothless upper jaw with a conversionosteotomie with sinus lift and insertion of enossal implants.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept was defined in 23 patients based on the preparation of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile forecast with video imaging, taking into account the frontal tooth aesthetics.
The surgical and/or prosthetic treatment concept has been modified in 8 patients due to preoperative planning.
All patients were very happy with the functional and aesthetic outcome achieved.
The profile forecast with video imaging means a useful decision-making tool in planning the rehabilitation of the atrophic upper jaw to take into account the mutually impacting factors - the extent of the upper jaw pre-location, the direction of insertion of enossal implanates and the type of supraconstruction.
A large-scale multicentre juvenile xanthogranuloma is reported, whose unusual clinical and histological aspect initially did not allow diagnosis.
Spontaneous regression during more than 2 years with the change in the primary monomorphic fibrocytic towards a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storage giant cells and the lack of specific cell organelles could ensure the nature of the disease.
Thymus preparations are offered for the treatment of rheumatic forms.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with poor and partly ethically questionable study design, as well as studies that do not allow a scientifically justified statement due to short study duration and low patient numbers.
A medically acceptable therapy recommendation for thymus preparations for rheumatoid arthritis (e.g. for rheumatoid arthritis) cannot be derived from this basis with sufficient positive benefit-risk assessment, taking into account the potential risks associated with treatment.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral ast of the A. hepatica dextra in a 64-year-old patient.
After initially uncharacteristic upper-building symptoms, repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding had occurred to the shock symptoms, the causes of which were hampered in the case of a condition after Billroth II magene resection.
The superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising therapy option.
Investigations into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic insult have shown that optimal conditions exist when the early symptoms of stroke are detected quickly and treatment is initiated within 3 h of onset of initial symptoms.
Between the onset of symptoms and the onset of therapy, valuable time is often lost.
The symptoms are not noticed or bagatized by patients, relatives or witnesses.
The increase in this number can be achieved through increased training, which both the public and emergency medical staff take into account.
The valid standard of treatment in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxidation, heart rhythm disorder treatment, blood pressure management and hyperglycemia and hyperthermia therapy.
As part of maintenance therapy with synthetic opioids, the effectiveness of sublingually applied buprenorphine in tablet form was compared with oral methadone in 40 opiate-dependent patients over a period of 24 weeks.
In the randomized study, the retention rate (=percentage of patients who stayed in the study program for the entire duration of the study and ended as planned) was defined as the target parameters, additional consumption and retention duration.
A mean daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and a mean dose of 63 mg methadone showed a tendency for retention rate (p=0.06) for the methadone-treated group.
The failure rate in the group treated with buprenorphine (n=20) tended to be higher in 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated group (n=20).
There was no significant difference in the additional consumption of opiate, benzodiazepines and cocaine between the two during treatment.
Methadone was considered the more successful substance (p=0.04) in terms of the duration of the study.
How important and meaningful are clinical parameters and locoregionary therapy failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharynx carcinomas for the likelihood of occurrence of haematogenetic metastasis?
Between 1,8,1990 and 1,10.1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharynx carcinomas were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and were examined for clinical parameters, reflexotalgia, prevailing structure of tumour growth, T-category, lymph nodes infestation and enjoyment habits.
29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In 25/139 patients, a radical neck dissection was performed according to the therapy concept after complete radiotherapy.
10/139 patients were later treated with an "opération de rattrappage."
The median follow-up was 24 months (ranges 4 to 74).
At 77/139 (55%), suffering could be controlled locoregionarily.
The tumour was not ruled in 62/139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local therapy failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumours, were comparable to Karnofsky index, age, gender, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pre-therapeutic diagnosis, total dose (Gy) and the number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.
The tumour control was significantly determined by the parameters reflexotalgia (p < 0.0078), growth structure (p < 0.012), T-category (p < 0.03) and smoking (p < 0.005).
The median survival time of patients with locoregionary therapy failure was 17 months.
At that point, 81% of locally controlled patients were still living.
In 23% (14/62) of locoregionary non-controlled patients, remote metastasis was detected, but only 4/77 (5%) of loco-regionally cured patients (p < 0,0026).
Local control probability and remote metastasis, the most common lung metastasis, reached a plateau after 24 months.
Locoregionary tumour control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a crucial indication of the likelihood of remote metastasis.
Failure of therapy has its cause in the biological aggressiveness of the tumour.
With the introduction of multi-line detector-CT (MDCT) into clinical practice, a new dimension is achieved in volume acquisition and location and time resolution in the CT.
However, the MDCT's new technical options require a redefine of investigative strategies to improve existing CT applications and unlock new scopes of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated according to symptomaticism and current therapy of cross-otter bites (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect is the development of sometimes threatening edema;
If there are no signs of poisoning more than 2-3 h after the event, the likelihood of severe poisoning is very small.
Part II reports the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of reparative and reconstructive interventions on the distal strain of the knee joint.
In 44 patients, the MPT fixer was created in assembly form A and in 23 patients in assembly form B.
4 patients experienced a deep infection caused by the fixater in 2 cases.
The 63 patients treated with the MPT fixateur carried the system on average 7.3 weeks.
5 patients with partial patelletomy and transossary refixation of the league were examined. patelle in cadastral debris fractures and 12 patients with transossary close-trefixation of the league. patellae in abrasion and outbursts at the lower patellapol or seam adjustment of the league. patellae in intraligamentary rupture, where no other care on the knee joint took place except for the stretcher surgery.
In 2 patients, the result was classified as normal after IKDC score, at 10 as almost normal and 4 as abnormal.
Isocinetic, only 5 of the 17 patients experienced a force deficit of the stretch muscles on the surgery leg of 10-20% compared to the opposite.
To summarize, the EPTT has proven itself with the MPT fixator in continuous restorative interventions on the distal stretcher of the knee joint and represents a powerful alternative to patellotibial decomposition with wire or synthetic tape material.
Thromboembolic diseases of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Newer diagnostic options and diagnostic algorithms can now reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of lung embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic lung embolism and describes diagnostic strategies that have been studied in clinical trials.
Based on the casuistics of a 6-year-old boy, Hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis triggered by UVA exposure with potential turnout in children, is presented.
In light-exponized areas, numerous haemorrhagic bladders occur at the beginning of the bright season, recurrently until adulthood.
As part of a field test, we gained experience in the use of the MEDICUS teleadiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiological department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynecology.
The central recording method in the X-ray diagnostics of mouth, jaw and facial surgery is the panoramic layer image.
The reduction in dose requirements has continued to be made possible by advances in equipment technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such as sensors or storage films.
Diagnostic inadequacies of conventional recording methods make imaging necessary for numerous clinical issues of oral, jaw and facial surgery through computer tomography and nuclear spinography.
Although the core spintomography is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now allows to map out changes in corticalalis due to the shortening of the measuring times.
For certain questions, such as changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclei-medical procedures allow for map-assisted function analysis.
Body-oriented psychotherapy is now used in hospital and outpatient, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are particularly important for patients whose body feels reduced, which are restricted in their emotion or, due to character resistance, difficult to achieve in verbal psychotherapy.
Today's most common methods are cited with short examples, and other methods are pointed out.
Acting factors include the connection of the affects to the vegetative and arbitrary nervous system as well as the close connection between psychological and physical processes, which connects with the ever experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological effects.
In the further development, the body and certain body regions also get a symbolic and important importance for therapy.
The relationship between the body-oriented procedures for verbal psychotherapy, especially psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.
Psychotherapists live in a tension between family idealism and reality, which have been influenced by various current and past experiences.
The role and function of their own family of origins often influence career choice and personal life plans.
Although psychotherapeutic activity gives the individual a lot of room to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy for psychotherapists to realize a family model corresponding to them and their partners.
Three models are shown and described in their effects.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic activity are discussed on their own couple and family relations.
Psychotherapists should pay the same attention to their personal relationships in their education and training as to therapeutic relationships with patients.
Advanced heart failure is gaining increasing importance within the cardiovascular patient group with a prevalence of 0.1%.
The 6 to 12 month survival likelihood is significantly limited at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunocompression with cyclosporin, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplant has been considered the therapy of choice for drug-refractory heart failure.
However, the growing mismatch between supply and the need for suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive list for heart transplant.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical approaches have developed.
Conventional drug therapy has been improved by the use of angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors and anti-congestive beta blockers.
The surgical therapy of advanced heart failure has been extended with the introduction of high-risk dysfunction, high-risk collapsing surgery, mechanical assistant hearts, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricular reduction plastics, cardiomyoplasty and multisite patching.
These therapy options are either used as bridging or as medium and long-term alternatives to heart transplant.
Treatment success depends crucially on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
This requires the creation of risk scores based on national and international patient registers.
In the example of a 30-bed station of the Orthopedic University Clinic Bochum, the emergence of TLA procedures is compared to manual therapeutic handles in the period of one year.
On the other hand, 122 manual therapeutic handles were performed on HWS, BWS and LWS by the respective station doctors with completed training.
While the TLA focused on the main predilection site of the respective disease (pseudoradical HWS and LWS syndromes), manual therapy was primarily focused on incidental findings in other spinal days in patients with the mentioned diagnoses or postdiscotomies syndrome.
The hike of a retinated lower jaw tooth from the site of its facility to ectopic areas is usually described for corner teeth.
With this case report, we present the case of migrating a retinated lower premolar to the Processus muscularis documented over a period of 14 years.
Migration along the ascending lower jaw until the muscle progression took place after the end of the root growth, after the patient's 20th year.
Neither radiologically nor clinically did this patient find any concrete causes of such an extensive hike.
The incidence of prostate carcinoma and curatively treatable cases through radical prostate esculectomy is increasing.
The exact pathological examination of the surgical preparations determines the stage classification and thus the evaluation of the forecast and the further clinical procedure.
Since a standardized method for processing the preparations is missing internationally, the comparability of various scientific studies is more difficult.
The rational preservation of the preparations we have proposed, which is precisely defined, is designed to fix these problems and improve interdisciplinary dialogue.
The flush increase in requirements for documentation, performance detection and quality control require the use of computer tools at the clinic.
Since 1992, a client server based surgical planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been used in the Orthopedic Clinic of Justus-Liebig University, Gießen, which has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, the clinical and scientific claims of the clinically active doctor have been taken into account.
The basic functions include patient master data management, surgical planning (termination of interventions, resource planning), surgical documentation (coding of diagnostics and interventions), quality assurance, clinic communication (e-mail, information systems), and clinical text processing.
By simultaneously integrating the WEB server into MedXS, content and functions can be accessed from the intranet or internet via any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM).
With the use of the application, important clinical reliefs have been achieved and far better conditions have been created for budget negotiations with health insurance companies.
The phenotype of the interstitial Deletion 4q- is characterized by unspecific neurological symptoms and, above all, facial dysmorphic signs.
However, the presence of congenital leukodermias (Piebaldism, Partieal Albinism) is considered relatively typical and mostly directional.
Arrhythmogeneous right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT), particularly in young patients.
The focus of the therapy is on the treatment of chamber tachycardia and the prevention of sudden heart death.
In individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM, there is manifest heart failure, which is being treated medications according to normal therapy guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method that can be used to investigate a tumour for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and yield a genetic pattern that captures ageing at chromosome and subchromosome levels.
The question of a necessary patella replacement in the context of knee-total prosthesis is generally very controversially negotiated.
In this context, we need to get more information about the spontaneous development of an unreplaced Patella in the prosthetic environment than only compared to the prosthetically supplied Patella.
The fact that we have only done the patella replacement in special cases for almost 5 years has made us available a patient’s product where this question can be studied.
On the basis of 30 total prosthetically supplied knees with 2-year follow-up, we focused on the natural and then the prosthetic femoral Patellag conduction bearing, and the results of the movement range achieved after 2 years and the persisting pain symptoms.
Regular adjustment of the knobling Patellasilhouette to the prosthesis guide bearing was observed with compression of the edge-resistant bone contact zone with or without fibrous placeholder layer;
7 patients were assigned a "rest problem group" due to their clinical follow-up as they had residual complaints (n = 3) or a mobility of only 90/0/0 degree flexion/extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were cases with postoperative shift above 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with postoperative tit above 15 degrees (n = 3).
Within this group, also with significant differences from the problem-free collective, complaints correlated with a pronounced preoperative tit and reduced mobility with a severe preoperative shift.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the knee disc history (16 mm/39 degrees) due to aseptic tibial prosthesis.
After axe-correcting the tibial components, this patient became trouble-free and well-moving again, without having a surgical intervention on the Patella and although a considerable residual remains.
The conclusion is therefore close to the fact that a greater effort appears to be allowed for the correction to reach a residual shift below 5 mm:
In addition to common surgical steps influencing the knee disc history during implantation, for example, a high quadrizepse relocation or a medial offset refixation of the replaced tubrositas may be required.
On the other hand, a residue is well tolerated up to 15 degrees, since the non-prosthetically supplied Patella has an amazing adaptability to the prosthesis conduction bearing by remodeling bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative maladministration, where we had not made a replacement due to good peroperative bone quality, we had to accept more late problems even in the case of normalized knee discs.
Whether there is an extended indication of the patella replacement in such cases remains open.
The quality assurance program of the VDR and the publications for the quality assurance of the DGRh provide the framework for external quality assurance measures.
Introducing comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic allowed the quality to be measurably increased.
The improvements were achieved through the implementation of targeted measures and changes in clinic structures.
Up to now, the focus has been on patient needs and internal treatment.
In order to increase employee satisfaction and qualification, rehabilitation-specific training series were carried out.
New forward-looking perspectives could be developed together with other partners.
Operational objective Avoiding or removing compression on the nervous structures.
This thesis provides an overview of oncocytary metaplasia and neoplasms.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that defects of the breathing chain occur in oncocytary cells of the auxiliary gland and the liver in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unresolved.
It is believed that oncocytary metaplases are pathogenicly different from oncocyte neoplases.
There are also organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocyte neoplasia.
For example, oncocytary carcinomas are preferable in thyroid gland, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
What molecular genetic mechanisms are responsible for is still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis-enteropathica-like skin changes in a longer-term parenteral diet.
Similar to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, this patient’s skin changes are also based on a zinc deficiency in the organism.
Substitution of zinc results in impressive improvement.
53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with neurodermitis and a skin-healthy sample of 52 people are compared to each other regarding their sexual behavior.
As test procedures, questionnaires on sexual behavior were used according to Arentewicz and his own questionnaire on sexuality and partnership.
The examined skin sufferers are significantly different from skin-healthy ones in the sense of an impaired sexual life.
The exchange of tenderness is in both sexes, and the ability to orgasm is greatly reduced among female patients.
Psoriatics feel more affected compared to patients with neurodermitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with neurodermitis have never been addressed to their sexual lives by their treating doctor.
However, for all problems of addressing this intimate area, the doctor should be a competent partner for issues concerning skin disease and their consequences for sexual life.
The conventional X-ray image must still be considered as a baseline for clinical questions of inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential not only covers inflammatory destructions, but also assesses their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image can indicate a clinical thrust situation through the collateral phenomena and represent the inflammatory volume multiplication of the joints and tendon separations directly and indirectly.
In addition, the high-resolution computer tomography, particularly through the detailed representation of cortical ankle structures - complementary to the MR - offers highly specific information, in particular on the tribal skeleton and on individual large joints, partly for definitive diagnostics, partly for surgical planning.
This applies, among other things, to the cross ankles, the star ocular joints and the upper HWS.
The supply of open lower leg fractures II and III degrees with concomitant soft tissue damage today includes a wide range of surgical possibilities of primary osteosynthesis.
Through the external fixater, the undrilled mark nail to the primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this happens under the primate of soft tissue coverage.
In recent decades it has been possible to significantly reduce the high rate of invalidating amputations and infections due to the associated successes.
If only individual cases were observed, then the signs grew that these patients had soft tissue problems on the lower leg from recurrent swelling to ulcer cruris.
A clinical examination using vein closure plethysmography in 80 patients from the 1985-1994 injury years and compared to 50 healthy subjects showed that more than 50% of all patients suffer clinically relevant damage to the vein system through the accident.
The severity of this damage can be seen from a simple swelling tendency to the Ulcus cruris, which is gaining significance in their clinical relevance with increasing temporal distance to the accident event.
To avoid further, also iatrogenic, damage, stringed attention to surgical guidelines in primary care is required, postoperative prevention is indicated.
Operational objective Correction of meta-epiphysical defects of the tibia by cortitomy and progressive distrasion.
Recovering the shape and function of the limbs.
Muzines are strongly glycosylated glycoproteins that exhibit a large number of carbohydrates and/or peptide sequences of existing antigen determinants.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry provided extensive insights into their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in antigen profiles could be described during the neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues.
A number of recent findings also suggest that muzin-associated antigens play a significant role in tumour biology, such as metastasis and as forecasters.
This thesis provides an overview of gastrointestinal muzin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology, including own findings.
In recent years, the development of rheumatoids in Germany has led to a networking of outpatients and inpatients with the specialists, internalist and orthopaedic specialists, health care specialists, ergotherapy and psychologists, as well as acute and rehabilitation clinics.
Rheumatological control points can further improve the cooperation between doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatological patients and ensure continuous and long-term treatment and care for chronic rheumatological quality management in a quantitative and qualitative manner.
Despite the increasing frequency of medikolegal problems, knowledge of the type and frequency of treatment errors after thyroid surgery is low.
The analysis of a collective of 21,515 complaints cases from 1975-1998 in the room of the doctors' chambers of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg revealed 222 complaints (1 %) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the observation period.
In 36 cases (16%), reviewers' commissions found treatment errors.
The complaint concerned surgeons in 95%, in 2% the anaesthetists, in 3% both disciplines and once an ENT doctor.
Of the complaints, 90% were related to complications after routine thyroid interventions.
Typical complications such as recurrencies (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), follow-up (3%), and late recurrence (1%), together accounted for 63% of treatment errors, but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), left nodes (4%), scar problems (5%), made up 37% of allegations but 70% of treatment errors.
Defects of reconnaissance were only 11% of treatment errors identified.
Treatment error was particularly common when re-operation was required (p < 0.001) if the surgical target was not reached (p < 0.001) or if complications followed a follow-up error (p < 0.001).
The area of "environment and health" is characterised by an interdisciplinary nature and a high level of communication.
What is more serious is that there are sometimes significant problems with the procurement of information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this area has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform for this area.
Recognized indications are bilateral renal tumours, renal tumours in patients with functional and anatomic individuals and patients with renal impairment who are at risk of dialysis following tumour nephritis (imperative indications).
Operational improvements - such as perfusion in hypothermia and workbench surgery - can also preserve patients with multiple and advanced renal tumours at over 95% from nephrectomy with subsequent dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-saving renal tumour surgery in imperative indications, more and more centers are increasingly recommending expanding parenchym-saving renal tumour surgery to a selectively healthy kidney (elective indications).
However, the benefit of selective resection appears low in the incidence of bilateral renal carcinomas of only 2%.
The forecast for local recidivism is infuriated in most cases.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has so far been most commonly described in small cell bronchial carcinomas.
We report 3 patients with CAR in the presence of Mamma carcinoma or a carcinoid of Cervix uteri.
Background and questioning.
For the development of rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterial skin diseases was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognized standard method for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regime is not only effective, but also low-impact.
Below, a patient is reported with pronounced, long-lasting hyperpigmentation in the cured psoriasis herds during this combination treatment.
Extracorporeal shock wavelithotripia (ESWL) is the standard therapy of urolithiasis.
Different lithotriptors have been developed with largely the same technical principles.
In the current discussion are the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the likelihood of recurrence, which further make sense of the corresponding metaphylaxis.
While the adverse reactions are known and predictable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL are still pending alongside other forms of therapy.
Following treatment of fibrine reaction in the front of the eye by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), clinically isolated acute corneal calcification was observed.
The previously unknown patho mechanism led us to the following investigations.
The common occurrence of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF-ET) and active tuberculosis may have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our cascading, we represent the symptomaticism, diagnostics and therapy of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis according to IVF graft.
Various options are discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] using the polymerase chain reaction.
By using two primer pairs, all-specific sequences can be amplified and displayed on a polyacrylamide gel by silver color after redistricting digestion.
The following allel frequencies could be determined in a south-west German population group:
Allel A = 0.2704, Allel B = 0,0741 and Allel 0 = 0,6556.
In 10 out of 280 subjects examined (3.57%), the selected method of analysis, which takes into account only the nucleotide positions 261 and 703, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, since differentiation between the A and 02 alpha is not possible.
Chondropathia patellae usually do not require arthroscopic explanation.
That exceptions must apply is to prove the following casuistics.
A 12-year-old boy complained about pain at the proximal/lateral patella facet after a football match.
Arthroscopic was a solid, nodule-shaped, binary tissue converted hematom that effortlessly with a Hol :
At the football match, it was obvious that a bleeding was caused by pregnancies or patella subluxation.
The boy was trouble-free after arthroscopy, muscle atrophy rapidly formed.
Two thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during their illness.
Glucocorticoids have a quick and sustainable effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data is presented that suggests a longer-term effect (longer than a year).
More recent studies clearly show a corrective effect on joint destruction at RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of inflammation from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these recent studies give additional insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical trials support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes, which are only loosely connected by the underlying causes of the RA but develop independently to a certain extent.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids could relate to different mechanisms, represented elsewhere at this symposium.
Ejaculated sperms and sperm genera express - and chains of 1, 3- and 4-integrins as well as their ligamenting fibronectine and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show a pronounced intra- and inter-individual variation and different localizations on the sperm surface.
The "nested" polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human permias.
To this day, it is unclear whether the AM is functionally relevant to the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells, or only "biological redundancy" or only the last binding insurance (final insurance).
The marking of the sperm-AM was modified by progesterone, human follicle fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-Acetyl-5-methodoxytryptamin) is a hormone produced and secerated under the influence of the Glandula pinealis.
The spread of the hormone follows a circulating rhythm with low, even mirrors during the day and an evening surge and nightly peak between 2.00am and 4.00am.
In addition, irrespective of a receptor system due to its strong lipophilic properties, melatonin has the ability to diffusion freely through cell membranes and act as a radical catcher in the extra and intracellular space.
The affinity for the heavily damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly large.
In dermatology, melatonin provides perspectives for some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The impact of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
In topical use, melatonin has an suppressive effect on the formation of a UV erythema.
The penetration properties of the skin and the oral availability are some findings that can be supplemented by further analysis of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear diagnostics in chronic inflammation is on the one hand due to the availability of high-sensitive radiopharmaceuticals, which allow for the localization of an inflammation stove when the focus is unclear, given the possibility of full-body interest rate and the SPECT technique, and, on the other hand, the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals, such as proof of leukocyte infiltration.
Both method approaches are complementary to red-gen morphological processes, which may specify a focus that has been found or which result in inflammation interest rate when the findings are unclear.
Background and questioning.
Kryochirurgy has been established as a method for the treatment of capillary infant hemangiomas for a long time.
Unsurprisingly, however, detailed studies have so far been missing that show their effectiveness in the tumours regularly subject to spontaneous regression.
The patient's prediction depends on both primary, mechanical brain damage and the development of secondary brain damage.
The causes of secondary brain damage are discussed alongside the intracranial space requirement due to post-traumatic bleeding and edema formations, as well as the resulting ischaemia, inflammation processes.
Both insulated SHT and polytrauma with and without brain damage, an inflammatory "system reaction" (SIRS) with the involvement of cytokines and other inflammation mediators can lead to single or multiorgan failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and dysfunctions are usually overliveable, but can end fatally in your combination and cumulation.
Hypermetabolic conditions according to a SHT are also considered as interactions of the CNS with the overall organism with the participation of the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of an SHT on the rest of the organism can be compared to the impact of multiple injuries to the brain function of a polytraumatized injured person, with shock-related perfusion disorders that can cause forecast-limiting hypoxies of the brain.
In addition, the generalized "total inflammation reaction" affects blood clotting, metabolism and fracture healing.
The knowledge of the trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the overall organism as well as the impact of the therapy measures currently used are still insufficient and need further education.
Finally, from this point of view, the choice of the right time for secondary interventions, which do not directly serve to maintain life and lead to an additional burden on the patient through surgical trauma must also be considered.
This work seeks to summarise important aspects in this area.
The molecular forms of the PPE and, more recently, human calculus 2 (hK2) have proved valuable decision-making aids to improve the definition between benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate carcinoma, but also for the early detection of prostate carcinoma.
Children with facial gaping are at increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems may be affected.
The literature on the incidence of heart defects varies considerably.
46 psychotherapy breakers have faced 599 full patients and have been examined for striking personality traits.
They were also questioned by questionnaires about their personal reasons for the cancellation.
Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin was described as an early childhood manifest, dominant hereditary dermatose with partially circulating horny erythema especially among families from the South African district of Oudtshoorn.
The seasonal attachment to the winter half and the characteristic histologically multiform finding distinguish these dermatoses from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histological and first immunohistological findings of a 4-year-old patient that fit well with the erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area were not found.
17 studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondarthropathies (SPA), Lupus erythematodes (LE), localized and systemic scleroderma (SD) were examined regarding their results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the work is clearly visible.
In this study, it should be examined whether visual sharpness decreases depending on performance time, and whether normal people and nystagmus patients are disadvantaged by these regulations in the driving evaluation.
Sudeck syndrome affects extremity after microtrauma or surgery.
Currently, there is no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptomaticism of Sudeck syndrome was caused by an excessively strong inflammation reaction to an injury or surgery of extremity.
His theory found no followers because most of the doctors think that Sudeck syndrome is triggered by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We conducted various clinical and experimental investigations and also captured the effects of anti-inflammatory therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory set up by Paul Sudeck.
In this thesis, methods for the application of the rapid multi-layer spiral CCT for cardiovascular imaging by means of EKG-synchronized spiral acquisition are presented.
Computer tomography, in addition to the conventional radiological examination procedures used in dentistry, enables an overlay-free representation of upper and lower jaws.
In addition to the already established application of the CT in malignant diseases, their use has proved to be helpful in further questions.
If the examination is carried out with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of retinated teeth in the jaw bone and the damage caused by the retinated teeth can be assessed, so that early therapy is possible.
If the periodontal fission of the retinal tooth is separated, an orthopaedic classification is possible.
In the case of inflammatory dental diseases, horizontal and vertical bone degradation must be precisely determined.
The morphology and extension of cystic space demands can be captured with the CT.
Prior to intended implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by taking into account the remaining bone substance and the position of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the place, shape and number of implants can be determined.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of all patients with sepsis.
Case studies show the symptomaticism of the SE.
Control symptoms are a consciousness-strong exercise up to the coma.
Cranial computer tomography is usually also normal, a generalized brain oedema can occur.
In the electron encephalogram, a general change is shown, the extent of which correlates with the degree of the SE.
Mediator-mediated defense reactions of the organism to bacterial products as well as bacteriemia itself are essential aetiological factors.
Due to an amino acid metabolism disorder, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is changed.
A large number of other factors such as electrolyte shifts, hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, shock and ischaemia, as well as liver and renal failure may be involved in the emergence of encephalopathy.
Since early adequate sepsis therapy is of crucial predictive importance, the SE is particularly diagnostic as a possible initial symptom of sepsis.
Endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general diseases and reduced general condition has poor prognosis despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy.
Movies tell stories.
This is particularly true when people are confronted with conflicts of decision.
Medical ethics conflicts arise not only in doctor series or ill ills, but often in genres where this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedy, Western, love movies, gangster and crime films.
By staging such conflicts and providing solutions, films draw on moral values and are also seismographers for the social relevance of medical ethics issues.
However, in the film ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical case meeting and represents a helpful complement to the mediation of analytical and communication skills.
Decreasing the residualose rate compared to conventional PTCA led to stentimation becoming the most frequently initial intervention.
Therefore, in-stent stenosis - especially the long-lasting form - nowadays represents a significant clinical and economic problem.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty regarding these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuser in-stent restenosis.
The pre-clinical management of amputation injuries places great demands on rescue.
In addition to the initial care of the injured person, the initial supply of the amputee in the event of amputational injuries does not rarely decide on the success of the restoration measures.
The primary objective of larynx imaging is to analyse submersible structures that are not accessible to laryndroscopic evaluation.
Therefore, it is considered a general rule to carry out the imaging diagnostics of the Larynx with knowledge of the findings of endoscopic diagnostics.
The topographical and anatomic conditions of the skeleton, the inland structures and the surroundings of the Larynx will be synoptically represented.
Through transpedic stabilization with a screw ring band system, the instability was lifted with segmental function maintenance.
In recent years, new findings have been gained on post-traumatic changes to skull-brain trauma (SHT) and related pathophysiological relationships.
In addition to the corresponding changes in neurotraumatological-intensive management, this has led to the development of pharmaceuticals to reduce the occurrence of secondary damage in the brain-injured patient.
This thesis addresses the new findings of pathophysiological changes according to SHT and the principled pharmacological intervention options.
While some of the medicines are already in clinical use, others are in differently advanced experimental and clinical trial stages.
Background and questioning.
Melanom patients at stage IV with progressive disease are a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of this thesis was to check the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with Trofosfamide on the course of therapied melanoma patients.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had taken prophylactic minocycline for over 3 years due to lung silicone before symptomatic black spots occurred in the face.
In the other patient, after only 6 months of taking minocycline due to folliculitis, grey-black spots on both thighs occurred.
A sample treatment with the ruby laser led to re-education in the treated area in this patient.
The various clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed on the basis of case studies.
Operational aim to eliminate the deformity of a Digitus quintus superductus et varus.
Microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the face in recent years.
A key factor is the recovery of neural abilities.
As part of this study, the sensitive regeneration capacity of the N. alveolaris inferior was examined after tumor surgical partial resection and reconstruction with the vessel-shaped N. thoracicus longus.
Feeling of pressure and pain could be felt after 3 months, touch and vibration at the earliest 5 months and thermal stimulus at the earliest 7 months postoperatively.
The vascularly stalked N. thoracicus longus therefore represents a suitable nerve transplant for bridging resective defects of the N. alveolaris inferior in tumour patients.
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) is the most common cause of conscious overdose in the United States and the United Kingdom, but a large number of overdoses only lead to severe complications.
Severe liver toxicity must be expected in any patient who has exceeded the standard dose and the hepatotoxic minimum dose of 125 mg/kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, treatment with N-Acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
Furthermore, in any patient where the strength or time of overdose is unknown, complete treatment with N-Acetylcysteine should be performed regardless of their serum levels.
In all cases, treatment with N-Acetylcysteine must continue when liver function deteriorates.
For starting signs of severe hepatic toxicity, a specialist should be consulted to ensure optimal therapy or immediate relocation in case of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplant has significantly improved the fate of a so far incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be made through closer cooperation between the in-depth hospitals and the special facilities for liver disease.
Background and questioning.
Itching is a difficult-to-advise occurrence of numerous dermatoses and inner illnesses.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid from the paprika plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
Capsaicin blocks unmyelinated, polymodal C and A nerve fibres during topical application after an initial phase of neurogenetic inflammation and selectively suppresses itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents both diagnostic and therapeutically problematic urological disease.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low at 55-73% and 10-40% respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicle denervation as an operational alternative to therapy refractory testalgia.
12 patients were surgically treated by seed strandurolysis after adequate environment diagnosis:
The M. cremastericus is separated by bipolar diathermia, the adventitia of the A. testicularis is replaced under microsurgical conditions at a length of 2-3 cm.
For a median follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) are trouble-free.
Intra and postoperative complications have not been observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical seed strandurolysis should be included in therapeutic considerations in patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our surgical procedure can only be maintained if the indication is accurate, so that an accurate environmental diagnosis for the exclusion of a specific gene of the testalgia is essential.
In neurosurgery, too, the trend towards less and less invasive surgical techniques goes to avoid major Trepanations, minimise the preparative trauma of the brain, spinal cord and nerves, thereby keeping the risk of neurological and mental disorders as small as possible.
Hospitalization and inability to work can be shortened so frequently.
Essential "minimally invasive" procedure is neurodoscopy.
The brain offers good conditions for the use of the endoscope with its preformed cavities, brain chambers and subarachnoid space.
The most common indication of neural endoscopic intervention is the closure hydrozephalus.
But also arachnoidal cysts, cystic tumours and smaller intraventricular space demands can be effectively treated via a small hole.
With the use of special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even strongly vascularized processes, e.g. cavernouns, can be completely removed.
Endoscopes are also used in a number of spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome and adjuvant in microsurgical surgery.
The aim of the thesis was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) by diffusion weighted (DW) MRI in invertebral metastases and in MR-morphologically inconspicuous vertebrae.
The DW-MRI measures the specific ADC for a tissue, which corresponds to the own diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
High ADC is expected in cell-rich tumour tissues with numerous intra and intercellular membranes (i.e. diffusion barriers).
In a 53-year-old man, a melanotic lung tumour had completely closed the left main bronch and the base was localized in the bronch of the left underlapp.
After laser therapy, cuff resection of the left lung underprain was performed.
Due to histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumour was classified as malignant melanoma.
In the history, there was no evidence of an earlier removal of skin, mucous or eye changes.
Also, the targeted investigations of the skin and the eye did not indicate a primary tumour locally located there.
Thus, the new formation is to be considered as the primary malignant melanoma of the respiration tract, of which 21 cases are considered secure so far.
The patient is tumor-free after a relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
There are no experiences of dawn at LASIK yet.
We therefore examined the twilight fore and after LASIK to correct myopia.
In recent years, dobutamin strechocardiography has been etched as a standard method for non-invasive ischaemia diagnosis.
With ultra-fast magnetic resonance tomography, identical pharmacological strut protocols can be performed, as is currently used in echocardiography.
HLA-DR antigens of the Kornea are lost as part of an organ culture storage.
This thesis examined whether this is down regulation of the HLA-DR antigen or loss of HLA-DR-positive coronal Langerhans cells (LZ).
DNA cytometry has evolved into a routine diagnostic technique, preferably used in mamma carcinoma to assess ploidism and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
The static cytometry (microscopic cytometry) is inferior for reasons of lower statement force of flow cytometry.
Flow cytometry requires standardized and methodically flawless technology with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The extracted parameters, in line 1 the S phase and the proliferation index, in the 2nd line also the ploidy, represent predictive and important factors for therapy planning.
An accurate knowledge of the method and the errors is essential for interpreting the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for the determination of proliferation ketics provide equivalent information must be considered unresolved at the moment.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric research and the improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measurement values.
Injection therapy is important for cervical syndromes.
This contribution deals with general requirements and the various practical methods for injection.
Summary The costs of post-exposition prevention (PEP) for HIV by statutory health insurance is unclear, with the issue of private health insurance not to be considered.
As legal bases for the transfer of costs, the regulations on the prevention of illness (§ 20 SGB V), medical precautions (§ 23 SGB V) and the health examination (§ 25 SGB V) will not be eligible.
However, the special treatment form PEP has not yet been included in the regular financing of health insurance, as corresponding recommendations of the federal committees are missing.
It would be desirable if appropriate recommendations were adopted soon to remove legal uncertainty in this area.
A cost transfer obligation may be considered in accordance with the principles of the legal character of the so-called new methods of investigation and treatment.
However, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP must be concreteized in terms of indication and application and be exempted from confusion.
If a doctor does not use PEP for an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a treatment error, as from a scientific perspective there are still too many ambiguities.
HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplant immunity.
Organ cultural storage results in the loss of HLA-DR-positive Korneal Langerhans cells.
The preparatory work examines the importance of an extended coronal storage time for the success of perforating keratoplasty.
Based on his own experience with 3D echocardiography, an effort was made to reconstruct ultrasonographic transphonic studies 3dimensionally and to investigate their information content.
Hypopyon urveitis was described as a dose-dependent side effect in AIDS patients who were treated systemically with ritafobutin due to mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report a 37-year-old patient who experienced heterotopic oscillations after a total of 105 days intensive therapy with 72 days of ventilation on 5 large body joints with nearly complete stiffening.
In intensive therapy, double lung transplantation was associated with severe pulmonary hypertension.
Resection of ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and the equilateral elbow as well as both hip joints allowed a restoration of mobility.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur in particular post-traumatic, after injury to the spinal cord, after SHT, in intoxication and in the long-term coma.
Although the exact pathogenic mechanism is not known yet, a transformation of mesenchym cells into osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then condition the bone regeneration.
Diagnosis is performed with the help of imaging procedures.
Prophylactically, drug treatment can be performed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), irradiation or a combination of both procedures.
We report a patient with chronic diskoid lupus erythematodes (CDLE), in which we first used the Argon laser for local therapy.
The patient suffered from long-term skin changes that were not or only slightly influenced by established treatment strategies.
Following the use of the Argon laser, a complete and permanent cure occurred in the area of the therapy lesions.
Histological and immunohistological findings indicate that vessel-related effects of the argon laser are important for observed effects in LE-related diskoid lesions.
In the context of these case descriptions, the effectiveness of the Argon laser is shown for the first time in the treatment of therapy-resistant diskoid skin lesions in the lupus erythematodes.
Complications of viral hepatitis are the most common liver transplant indication.
For the affected patient, this is often the only life-saving option.
The prevention of HBV infection by polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analogue Lamivudine is effective but expensive.
Reinfection in hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a cheaper forecast compared to HBV infection.
Effective reinfection prevention in hepatitis C has not yet been established and needs extensive studies.
For hepatitis C, the prognosis for the transplant is more unfavourable after re-infection, while the 5-year survival rate is similar to other naming non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcoma are rare.
We discuss this entity on the basis of a case study and the existing literature.
The therapy of these tumours consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiation therapy.
One exception is the rhabdomyosarkomas, which also appeal well to chemotherapy.
Katheterablation in pre-excitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with curative entitlement.
Accessive lines between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomic requirements for orthodromes or antidrome reentrytachycardia of different incidence, duration and frequency.
The understanding of tachycardia and the role of the accredited trajectory in tachycardia, the identification of their topography, the function of the other structures of the pathogen conduction system and the detection of further paraspecific fibres are prerequisites for successful catheter rablation.
Anomalies of tricuspidal flap or coronary sinuses and coronary disease of the heart should be examined before intervention with echocardiography and, if necessary, at the beginning of intervention with contrast display.
In 300 patients with verse-hied variants of pre-excitation syndrome, their own genera of catheterrablation are presented.
In order to achieve a better recording of complication events in orthopaedics and to have comparable statistics for years, standardization of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is required.
Since 1.1.1997, the Heidelberg Orthopedic University Clinic has been running a full consensual register of all early complications of all patients in the hospital.
In accordance with a standardized nomenclature, the complications are prospectively captured by the doctors in a complication program and the information from the department of quality management of the clinic is controlled, corrected and supplemented and classified.
The guide will contribute to the discussion of a standard in the collection and evaluation of complications in orthopaedics with the aim of building consensus.
The acrobullious PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterised by the appearance of acrene bubbles at the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiology is likely to be based on an obligate impairment of dermoepidermal coherence, which is clinically manifested by mechanical stress in the form of pral bladders.
The acrobullious photodermatosis must be differentially distinguished from phototoxic reactions that occur as a result of high UVA radiation or high Psoral concentrations.
On the basis of two cases, the clinic, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this disease are presented.
In addition to autopathetically secured findings of a fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardiovascular myocardiovascular myocardiovascular myocardiovascular myocardiovascular myocardial replacement, there are currently no secure clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
In 1994, criteria for clinical diagnosis of ARVD were drawn up by members of the ISFC working groups and the European Society for Cardiology.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological specifics, which have been divided into main and secondary criteria.
On the basis of the following examination at a collective of 24 patients with histologically secured diagnosis of ARVD from Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, the value of the criteria developed is to be reviewed.
Global or segmental dilatations of the right ventricular in the sense of main criteria could be detected in 20 patients (83%) by angiography, or echocardiography.
4 patients (16%) only identified side-by-side criteria in radionuclide interest rate or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disorders of the right ventricular.
In all patients, the typical fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium could be discovered histologically.
T-inversions in right pre-coordinated derivatives were available in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS spread of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 was found as the main criteria in 8 patients (33%), an epsilone wave in 6 patients (25%).
A late potential analysis by signaling ECG was only available in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of ancillary criteria.
left thigh block chamber cycardia classified as ancillary criteria could be detected in 23 patients (96%);
Only one patient died without a proven arrhythmias from the progressive right heart failure.
An anaesthesia of an unexpected sudden heart death in the family as a side criterion could be raised in 3 in 19 patients (15%).
The task-force criteria for the diagnosis of ARVD developed led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, but the priority of a secure histological diagnosis was of particular importance.
Without the addition of histological data, clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains whether a purely clinical diagnosis is possible through a more favourable classification of findings in main and secondary criteria.
Unambiguous data show that severe hypoglycemia deteriorates the forecast of acute stroke.
In contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycemia in cerebral ischaemics is controversially assessed.
The contradictory results of clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained if different stroke types are considered separately and the time of blood sugar levels during the acute event is taken into account.
Hyperglycemia appears to increase neural damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischaemia if there is an insufficient collateral supply.
It also increases the risk of haemorrhagic transformation during this period.
In contrast, an acute blood glucose increase by improving substrate supply can protect nerve tissues from structural damage if there is only a moderate drop in cerebral blood flow.
This situation is in the area of penumbra and good collateral supply.
Therefore, we hypothesise that the negative and positive effects of acute hyperglycemia depend on local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgical diagnostics, according to which a selective epilepsy surgical procedure was performed in 50 of 173 patients with pharmacosal focal epilepsy.
The localization of findings of non-invasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), interiktal positron emission tomography (PET), and iktal SPECT (single photon emission computer tomography) formed the basis of focus localization.
78% (n=39) of all 50 patients became accident-free or had very rare seizures.
Extratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations when enclosed MRI lesions and the resections could be performed at sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our findings that non-invasive EEG derivatives in pre-surgical diagnostics are sufficient for a number of selected patients with pharmacosal focal, particularly temporal epilepsies, thereby preventing the risk of invasive EEG investigations.
History and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented herself in an external clinic with a newly-appeared tachyarrhythmia absoluta.
Echocardiography was initially suspected of an intracardial space requirement, which should be further clarified by transophageal echocardiography.
In the Ekg, a tachyarrhythmia absolutea with frequencies up to 146/min was found, intermittently a sinus rhythm was documented.
This could also be outstandingly confirmed in the X-ray examination of the Thorax as a large space requirement in projection on the back medianum, the right median edge after lateral.
Due to the surging growth of the cysts with the triggering of arrhythmia and the safe exclusion of malignant degeneration, the cyst was removed surgically via anterolateral thoracic disease.
The patient has been in the sinus rhythm ever since, and has only complained about single "suppressors" in the sense of single ventricular extrasystols.
Primary harmless arrhythmia may also be caused by rare causes such as thoracic, extra- or intracardial space requirements that require specific therapy.
There is an overview of the emergence of intrathoracal cysts.
Acute brain nerve paresis can have a wide range of causes.
Rare trigger of a paresis of a or multiple brain nerves is a division of the A. carotis interna.
Early detection of carotidation is important, even in cases of untypical symptomaticism, as early anticoagulatory therapy may prevent stroke as a result of dissectional embolism.
We report 2 patients with lesions of paracavernal brain nerves (Raeder syndrome) and cadastral brain nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of a division of the A. carotis interna.
In addition to the cranial and cadastral brain nerves involved in our cases, failures of the median brain nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so that any painful sudden brain nerve failure must also reflect carotid dissection.
The maladministration of right coronary artery from the arteria pulmonalis is one of the rarest coronary artefacts, often staying asymptomatic to high age, but can also become clinically manifest in infant age and lead to sudden heart death.
We report on diagnostics and surgical therapy in a 15 month old asymptomatic child, as well as the need for surgical correction.
The suspected diagnosis was coincidentally a result of echocardiography, the safety diagnosis by coronation.
The operation consisted of replanting the coronary arthritis without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated.
The surgical correction indication is also recommended in asymptomatic cases, due to the coronary heap and the associated coronary risk.
The surgical treatment of tibia head fractures with joint participation (AO classifications 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high requirements on traumatological management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the supply of joint fractures offers, among other things, the opportunity to achieve a good functional result through low, surgically caused soft tissue trauma.
The aim is to achieve at least exercise stability compared to standard procedures.
In addition to the small surgical soft tissue trauma, the exact intraoperative evaluation of the joint surfaces and the possibility of concomitant treatment of intra-articular concomitant injuries are of particular advantage compared to conventional procedures, in addition to the low surgical soft tissue trauma, the arthroscopy results in the exact intraoperative evaluation of the joint surfaces and the possibility of concomitant treatment of intra-articular concomitant injuries.
Out of a total of 54 patients with tibia head fractures, arthroscopic-assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients between September 1993 and January 1998 in our clinic.
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients showed overall good results, according to the Lysholm and Delamarter score.
In the case of a selected patient, we hold the arthroscopically supported minimal invasive osteosynthesis suitable for fractures of the AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report a 72-year-old patient who experienced a bilateral hypoglossusparesis after a moderate skull-brain trauma without any other neurological deficits, which was clinically regressive within 3 months.
Since computer-tomographically no skull base fracture was shown in the area of the rear skull pit, we discuss a double-sided breakdown of the N. hypoglossus as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a sick situation in which blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins in the conditions of daily life.
The resuscitation continues from the large lead veins to the smallest venols to the area of microcirculation and ultimately affects the metabolism of tissues.
As a basis for classification principles, typical clinical characteristics are best offered, which can be confirmed secondaryly with a simple objective measuring method.
Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is defined as an angiodermatitis that develops on the soil of arteriovenous short circuit connections.
In the area of lower extremities, usually unilateral skin changes occur that commemorate a caposi sarcoma (pseudo-capposi sarcoma).
These are accompanied by oedema, often severe pain and rarely hypertrophy of the extreme.
The disease is often rapid and results in ulcerative nodes with bleeding and infection.
The causal therapy is to eliminate the arteriovenous shunts.
Due to the large number and the often small calibre of the arteriovenous fistulas, an operational procedure is rarely feasible.
More suitable is superselective embolization, but with the risks of ischaemia and necrosis.
Successful, total 8 times embolization treatment is reported in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome.
So far, the exact diagnostics of the very rare primary histiocytoses of the skin were based alongside the clinic and histology at the H&E intersection on electron microscopy (Birbeck-Granula) and immunohistology on the freezer (CD1a).
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffinous markers now also allow for formal infixed material to be processed (also retrospectively) and precise classification of these diseases.
With antibodies against S-100 protein and by means of the lectin peanut agglutinine (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the classic cells of the Langerhans cell history (LZH) can be separated from other histiocyte cell systems.
In the so-called non-Langerhanszell history (non-LZH), there were no uniform electron optics and immunohistological characteristics.
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations of great importance for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophagi and dendritic cells).
Frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes/macrophagi and the dendritic cells and their reactions with the corresponding paraffinic immune-histological markers can vary widely within the different clinical entities.
Diagnostic pronouncing the delimitation of the Langerhanszell history appears to have antibodies against factor XIIIa (shown by the example of Xanthoma disseminatum) and monoclonal antibodies Ki-M1P (shown on juvenile xanthogranuloma).
Both markers show a positive response pattern with the epithelial cells typical of the disease.
The following we introduce a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of allopurinol administration and after re-exposition of this medication.
A susceptible carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner-Ulzera for 10 years.
In the world literature, 7 case reports of non- Bilharziosis-associated carcinoma of the urinary bladder have been published.
Although the development of a concomitant carcinoma of the urinary bladder has not yet been described as a complication of an IC, the patho Mechanism of the development of verdant carcinoma seems to be in chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
After exhausting the conservative therapy options, radical cystectomy and supravesical urination took place.
"NoToX Histological Fixative" is offered as a substitute for formalin/formaldehyde for fixing tissue samples for histological investigations.
Intraoperative tissue and autoptic organ samples were used to test NoToX.
Conventional histological dyes and accepted immunohistological dyes, particularly for tumour diagnostics, were used.
As a result of these independently performed tests at 3 different facilities, it was found that tissue samples fixed with NoToX had no differences in the reproducibility of conventional dyes or visibility of immunohistochemical reactions compared to formal infixed tissue samples.
NoToX has proved to be a viable substitute for formalin.
In order to describe the radiation exposure of the patient in computer tomography, dose sizes such as the computer tomography dose index (CTDI), the "multiple scan average dose" (MSAD) and the axis dose are usually used in air.
The CTDI and derived from the MSAD are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the volume of the investigation, but say little about the doses relevant from the point of view of the doctor and the patient according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs and the risks.
The axis dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose, which allows an estimate of the risk.
The indication of an upper indicative value for the axe dose should take into account the dose requirements of the study region to ensure acceptable image quality and, on the other hand, to avoid an unnecessary high risk.
As physical sizes, all 3 sizes are suitable for characterizing and differentiating different research programs and devices regarding radiation exposure.
According to a report by the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force defining and classifying cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory heart muscles was extended in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been reintroduced to this definition.
As a result, a number of infectious pathogens, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaly viruses and herpes viruses, appear to be involved in the emergence of inflammatory heart muscle disease and dilatation of the ventricular as important pathogenesis factors.
It seems sensible to allocate shame as a general human emotion in delimitation from guilt to a standalone place.
In addition to the defensive character, the "self"-preserving function of shame should also be taken into account.
The appearance of shame always points to the protection of the sense of value, even though it should not be apparent in the patient at the moment.
The signaling nature of shame is discussed and the question of whether symptoms of shame have a disease value.
The attention to psychogenesis and unconscious shame dynamics broadens the attention to potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This thesis provides a literature overview of the equally inhomogeneous treatment of acute psychosocial crises as well as of professional competence.
General treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, specific disorder and event-specific concepts and work for crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents from the last 10 years are described.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research as far as they are relevant for crisis intervention are presented with their findings.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammation and the potential participation of effectsor mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune system in their pathogenesis has been the subject of research in recent years.
Arteriosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome increase inflammation cells and lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
Increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronar atherectomy samples of 26 patients with unstable angina (Group 1) and 24 patients with stable angina (Group 2) were studied immunohistochemically (TUNEL test for fragmented DNA) and electron microscopic.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of plaques, detection and quantification of cell death events, and the delimitation of apoptosis and necrosis.
In a study in vivo and - according to the techniques developed by Thiel 1992 - special fixated bodies were examined to determine the position of the balloon and what happens to it when blowing up the balloon.
At the TEP, the fascie can at best be used lateral of the artery as a reinforcement of the back wall of the groin channel or as a repellant for fixing from the external material (net).
We introduce 2 patients aged 50 and 84 who imagined with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczema skin changes.
The detection of numerous mites in the shed crusts showed the diagnosis of a scabies norvegica;
an underlying condition could be excluded in both cases.
It is thought that eczema therapy for months has led to the exacerbation of the disease.
Haemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The effectiveness of haemoglobin solutions regarding O2 transport and, in particular, effective O2 delivery to the tissue is demonstrated in a variety of situations such as extreme haemodilution and haemorrhagic shock.
Genetic and chemical modifications stabilize the hemoglobin molecule.
This results in clinically viable intravascular half-life of approximately 8-24 h, adequate O2 affinity and lack of nephrotoxicity.
As a residual side effect of the haemoglobin solutions evaluated today, a certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned.
Nevertheless, haemoglobin solutions are also good for people.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are connections with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for transporting O2 and CO2.
This was demonstrated under extreme haemodilution, while extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation.
Perflubron, the most important agent in the group of fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of the artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also acute care for the injured.
An introduction is expected in the coming years.
It is based on clear physical laws and defined physiological laws.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally recognized indications for HBO therapy, in which it represents either the only causal, life-saving therapy form or an essential, often crucial therapy component of comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive therapy.
Among the potential side effects, the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication should be particularly taken into account alongside barot areas of the lungs.
The clinical use of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, adverse reactions and risks, targeted and critical indications, as well as the skills and skills to safely master complications with intensive or emergency medical measures.
The clinical use of hyperbaric oxidation with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive therapeutic character should therefore be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anaesthetist.
Our interest is the interaction of high-energy ultrasonic waves with biological tissues in relation to oncological therapy.
In this thesis the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give the hope that ultrasound could be used as an additional therapeutic technique for sound-accessible tumours due to its good depth focusability.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of applied ultrasonic parameters.
New results show that nuclear spinography is suitable for monitoring ultrasound-induced high temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive nuclear spintomographic temperature measurement can become an important instrument for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasonic therapy of human tumours be reviewed in carefully planned clinical trials.
In a group of extremely small premature babies, the long-term effects of premature birth on the avian and NO medical status should be demonstrated.
Since 1993, the orthopaedic university clinic Homburg/Saar has used an IT system for surgical and ambulance documentation as well as support for the general clinic organization.
As a hardware, a Novell network with DOS or Windows based PCs serves as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnostics and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since the introduction, the data of 31,500 patients has been recorded and 8,500 operations have been documented.
With the corresponding flexibility of the software, both the medical and management requirements can be taken into account.
Through further clinic-wide networking, the University Hospital Homburg also offers the opportunity to exchange data across departments and to use scientific networks and the internet.
As a result of a critical literature overview and a survey at German epilepsy centers on the usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following approach is recommended.
The aim of the study was to check whether Dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupil reaction.
It also points to non-medical reasons for the discontent of (mostly innocent) victims with current compensation practices.
In this research on the sheep, it should be clarified whether the intraarticular concentration of free sulphate and non-sulphurized glycosamine glycans shows a correlation with the extent of experimentally induced arthrotic damage, whether a temporal assignment results and whether the results suggest that the GAG is used as a prognostic criterion or arthritis marker.
21 sheep are randomized into 3 groups of 7 animals:
Controls are the knee joints of the counterlateral side and knee joints of animals from other approved projects (n = 54).
The radiological scores between groups TD vs. ME and MV are statistically significant (p < 0.01) different.
Compared to the control group, there is a significant increase in HA in groups ME and MV.
The CS results in a significantly increased level (p < 0.01) for the 6 months postoperative measurement in Group ME and a year after partial separation.
Clinical consequences:
The HA mirror allows - at least experimentally - a description of the degree of arthritis.
Concentration increases with a higher postoperative interval and a higher degree of damage.
The idiopathic long-QT syndrome can present itself in childhood with heartbreak, syncopes and cramps.
Treatment with blockers is considered standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
In the case of therapy failure, a pacemaker implant or surgical sympathetic blockade may be considered as an option.
We report the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardiovascular defibrillator in a 95/12-year-old patient.
These include supplements and use of an epidiascope, which is suitable for presentation of organ or organ discs in the courses of general and special pathology after minor modifications and saves expensive video installations with additional lighting, etc.
Narcissistic problems are common in higher ages and of widespread importance.
These issues are referred to the instance of the I-ideal here and examined under the angle of the increasing disparity of me and I-ideal in age.
In three aspects, pathological affections of the ageing process are shown, as they are often found in older patients.
Afterwards, narcissistic forms of transmission are described in these patients and options and objectives discussed in the treatment of older patients.
The treatment results of the muscle energy technique according to Mitchel are shown in spinal complaints.
Disorders of joint mobility on the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed with the muscle energy technique.
The therapy has a high success.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to surgical techniques with impulse.
We report a 26-year-old patient with a dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring known since the age of 10, who complains about arthritic knee ailments, recurrent diarrhoea and Sicca symptoms.
Clinical image, serological findings and the histologies of duodenal mucous membrane and lip biopsy as a diagnosis results in coeliac disease and Sjögren syndrome.
According to our findings, a common occurrence of these different symptoms has not been described so far.
The introduction of a gluten-free diet results in a rapid improvement of clinical symptomaticism, so that coeliac disease can be considered as the actual disorder in the fabric of individual immunological illnesses.
In industrialized countries, it is more medical conditions than lack of food that contributes to the emergence of malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly common in the older population and is found in 5-12% of independent residents, 30-61% of hospitalized and 40-85% of older people staying in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in age requires a structured differential diagnostic method for clarifying its causes.
A sharpened awareness of the doctor’s dietary problems and prompt risk assessment are essential requirements to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important for the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
The light microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 Junction/Compoundnävi showed statistically significant differences for 12 structural characteristics.
digitiform radial foothills, blue-grey rectangular patterns, opaque alabastergipse-like lacquers, brown/black dots against blue/grey background, pseudopodia-like edge zones and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
However, specific light microscopic phenomena are not known.
Therefore, a diagnostic evaluation of the malignancy of a melanotic tumour is based on several individual features that appear to be malignant in combination with malignancy.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of genetically therapeutic procedure in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Frequently related vectorial transport systems and strategies for integrating therapeutic genes into the respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, the gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation receptor antagonists provides new therapy concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
First clinical applicability studies in which such a gene (IRAP) has been transmitted are an essential step forward towards clinical gene therapy of arthritis.
In recent years, distractionosteogenesis has become an established treatment method for correcting hypoplastic lower jaws.
We report on our experience with uni and bidirectional distractors in both intra- and extraoral applications in 4 selected patients with lower jaw hypoplasia in syndromal disease images.
These included 1 boy with Pierre-Robin syndrome, 1 girl with one-sided lower jaw hypoplasia in Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with Nager syndrome, and 1 rare case of mid-line defect in 18p syndrome.
Distraction duration ranged from 6-30 days, with a bone gain of 6-28 mm.
Interested older people are increasingly recognizing the diverse possibilities the internet offers regarding information, communication and cooperation.
Further education and training facilities are required to facilitate access to the world of digital media through targeted group-specific offers, to support them in the acquisition of media expertise and to create interesting virtual learning opportunities for them.
Based on experience from the "Senior-Info-Mobil" information campaign, opportunities are described to give people over 50 access to the new communication technologies.
The example of the European network "Learning in Later Life" (LiLL) and other projects will further demonstrate how spatially and temporarily decoupled , research learning" of older adults could become the engine of a "new learning culture" in the sense of virtual working groups and networks, which also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or further education facility or cannot participate in local offers for health and other personal reasons.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnostics of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction aniography has been largely replaced by non-invasive MR angiography.
In recent years, the rapid development of MR tomography has opened up the possibility of new functional investigations.
The MR tomography of the heart is characterised by the combination of simultaneous detection of morphological and functional parameters by a non-invasive procedure without radiation exposure.
Due to the high spatial resolution and reproducibility, the Cine MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, there is now the possibility of clarifying many heart disease in an investigation.
MR spectroscopy provides the only way to understand the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed vascular presentation and flow quantification procedures complete the overall concept of MR heart diagnostics.
As the only diagnostic procedure, MR tomography offers the complete explanation of heart disease in an investigational course both as a first examination and for gradient control.
Due to the rapid development, existing restrictions will be resolved in particular in the field of MR coronarangiography in the foreseeable future.
There is an overview of 30 years of development of documentation and computers at the Heidelberg Orthopedic University Hospital.
Since its founding in 1967, 4 phases of development have been distinguished:
First medical initiatives, establishment of a basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, realization of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus control of performance.
Planning and realization were carried out in accordance with the framework plans and concepts of the University Hospitals of Baden-Württemberg.
We report the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of an extracorporeal heart pressure massage.
This is the first published case.
We report bacterial arteriitis after PTA and stentimation into Iliacalaritis with consecutive septic embolization, ipsilateral knee ankle embed and formation of an infected aneurysm spurium.
As a cause, the stent must be contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus.
The treatment was in the resection of the inflamed vessel section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem of six-year-old boy with one-sided split foot of type II with oligodactyly and second-toe clinodactyly.
This overview article deals with the current state of controversy regarding the indication of the back area replacement of the Patella.
The current state of knowledge in the experimental and biomechanical field is described as well as structural technical characteristics of the various implant types and specifics of patella preparation.
In addition, the author deals with the essential clinical studies on the subject of patella replacement and tries to give the reader criteria for the classification of the study results.
Finally, it is discussed why the indication of the back area replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication position could be formulated to replace the patella back area.
The biomechanical causes of the migratory and relaxing behavior of hip joint prosthesis are still unclear.
In particular, chronic mechanical overload of the boundary layers cannot be excluded due to changes in the stiffness and cushioning properties of the overall system.
Arterial hypertension is common after organ transplants in adults as a result of treatment with hypertensorin A, tacrolimus (FK 506) or prednisolon.
Little research has yet been undertaken into the behaviour of blood pressure in children after liver transplant.
The term "occult fracture" marks the lack of visible fracture marks in the conventional radiography performed at the first diagnosis, but still existing fracture.
Diagnosis is only achieved in the course of or through further diagnostics.
However, the Szintigraphy and CT (computer tomography) investigations carried out in this context only have moderate sensitivity and specificity.
With magnetic resonance tomography (MRI), a procedure is available that enables both early diagnosis of "occult fracture" and diagnosis of any choral and ligamentary companion injuries.
In the present study, we report 23 patients with traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomic regions where the diagnosis could be performed with the MRI for negative X-ray findings.
The athero-arterial embolism is an early described phenomenon.
Histological evidence of cholesterol crystals in small endstream railway arteries marked the concept of cholesterol embolism.
Due to the very variable clinical picture and the diagnosis to be secured only invasive or post mortally, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe aorta aorta aorta.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was more than 10% per patient year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, the aortic aortic aorta is caused by embolic complications in surgical interventions or catheters of the aorta.
Anticoagulants were shown to be effective in patients with a particular variant of aortic aortic aorta with stem and moving thrombodies derived from encrypted plaques.
Embolierezidives could be prevented and thrombin regression observed.
A 62-year-old patient with a pronounced valgus failure and an inhibition of the right knee as a result of a supracondylary thigh fracture, which had been provided osteosynthetically by dynamic condyl screw 2 years ago.
Here, the indication was placed to a variating and extending correctionalosteotomy and osteosynthesis by retrograde femur nail.
Within the 1st postoperative week, the patient was able to fully strain the lower right extremity with axe balance.
The principle of retrograde locking is an appropriate procedure to achieve good and stress-resistant osteosynthesis, even in the case of correction surgery.
Tear path surgery at the University Eye Clinic Münster of 296 children from 1987 to 1992 was studied.
The histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretions, crystaloids, luminal, basophilic mucus formation) are always suspective, but themselves do not prove to be carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (core size, hyperchromasis, nucleols, cytoplasma changes) must always be evaluated compared to pre-existing naming gland.
The immunohistochemical finding with basal-specific cytokeratins must be critically assessed in any case and can at best confirm a cancer diagnosis or (in case of positive proof of basal cells).
In this overview the various diagnostic criteria are compiled and their value for routine diagnostics is evaluated.
In another German study, maintenance therapy of 14 active 20mg TNFR55-IgG1 i.v. was compared to a monthly dose of 50mg.
Earlier, the 60 patients had received an inital dose of 100mg in this study.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed rapid and clear improvement of all measured parameters a day after the first dose.
Following the further administration of the test substance, the inflammation parameters increased.
In parallel, anti-TNFR55 IgG1 antibodies could be detected that accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
A 13-month-old patient who developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal haemangiomatosis is reported.
The combination of clotting disorder and spleen tumour already suggested the suspicion of vascular process.
The healthy newborn is also entitled to optimal care so that any disorder of postnatal adaptation is detected in good time.
The introduction of painless simple yet reliable methods such as pulse oxymetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has greatly simplified the situation for all those responsible.
Background and questioning.
In the light of increasing reports of resistance increases in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation should be determined for gonococcus strains isolated in Berlin.
Aquajogging is a technique used for years in sport and rehabilitation, in which in deep water, supported by a booster aid (west or belt), jogging - similar movements are executed.
In sport, aquajogging is used as a regeneration training and as a "low-impact alternative training" in strength endurance and endurance.
In rehabilitation, aquajogging is ideal for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and postoperative phase in diseases of the muscular apparatus and as endurance and light strength training in internalist diseases.
Operative therapy options for erect dysfunction are vascular surgical or prosthetic.
After the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery as the only causal therapy has its place in a selected patient asset.
The most important criteria are ages under 50, no more than 2 of the traditional risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
The long-term results had to be corrected from over 80% to about 53-55 %, contrary to initial short-term successes.
Venetian surgery has lost its place due to a sharp loss of long-term successes (average under 40%).
penile prosthesis surgery shows higher success rates at 85-90% long-term survival rates of implants and patient satisfaction of 89%.
Nevertheless, the irritability of the procedure often forces this therapy option to last in the therapeutic cascade.
Device type-dependent complications can occur such as cylinder defects and perforations with 5-year implant survival rates between 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbus transplants, which, however, are highly immunogenic.
We report on our 3 years of experience with the method of homologous central limbokeratoplasty developed by us.
Pentosanpolysulfate is relatively common for bladder instillation and significantly decreases nykturie frequency, while migratory frequnz remained unchanged during the day in a controlled study.
Heparin also lowered nykturie frequency in an open prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosanpolysulfate are virtually non-effectual.
The popularity of the internet is increasing in all areas of use, which is also true for applications in radiology.
Thousands of web sites with radiological information have emerged and are now available online, with competition from commercial offerings.
Following the initial experience, today the task is to critically appreciate the possibilities and risks of using the Internet as a distribution medium for radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are among the normal reactions of parents after a sudden child death (SID).
In the following, from a psychiatric and legal perspective, we report 2 cases in which mothers reacted with exceptionally severe depression after SID, accusing themselves of killing their child.
Finally, some recommendations for the care of affected parents are reported.
The review of the cases of 110 children taken within a period of 7 years with Burkitt lymphoma at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, showed an overweight of males compared to female patients (1.9 :
1) and an age of 5 years.
The areas first affected by the tumour, in the order of frequency, face and abdomen.
The spine, sprain and lungs were less infested.
It is thought that in the etiology of the tumour, a interaction between infections from malaria and Epstein-Barr viruses and malnutrition could play a part.
The most important drug is cyclophosphamide.
Combining this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in starting the recovery of the disease, but is better than the individual active substance in preventing systemic relapse.
Follow-up of patients showed a good survival rate.
The Zwickauer Klinik has been a widely known surgical center since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anaesthesia.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer have preserved, continued and complemented Braun's life.
From the Zwickau surgery important impulses for general and local anaesthesia, for hospital construction and clinic organization as well as for surgical teaching in word and image came out.
After a short overview of literature, the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania that have been little described in an adolescent patient are to be presented.
In the context of early fear of abandonment, the development tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness again threaten to be dropped.
The symptom that has so far served to regulate diffuse inner tension and anxiety can be abandoned like this.
seborrhoea eczema is a pathogenicly unresolved erythematosquamous skin disease with a prevalence of about 2.5%.
The often difficult to treat skin changes occasionally address the topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance that, however, as an undesirable effect depending on used concentration and individual sensitivity, can trigger pustulant dermatitis.
We report the onset of pustulotic dermatitis following the use of a false 50x to highly concentrated dithranol preparation of magistral prescription in a 30-year-old patient with seborrhoic eczema.
The renovascular hypertension is particularly important, because as a secondary hypertension form, it is successfully therapable and sometimes curable through interventional radiological or fertilizer surgery.
The frequency and history of intraoperative and postoperative complications according to LASIK should be studied.
An andrological patient is reported where the initial investigation led to the discovery of a high degree of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and a uranium plasma infection.
The increased FSH value and the size of the testicle, which was substantially below the standard range, spoke for a pronounced testicle parenchyma damage.
Proof of macrophages in the ejaculate strain can be understood as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
Following antibiotic pairing therapy with Doxycycline and subsequent 3 months of recovery with a combination treatment with vitamin C and E as well as the trace element Zinc, there was a clear improvement in spermiograms.
After another 2 months, an intrauterine insemination resulted in pregnancy with the subsequent birth of a healthy daughter.
At that point in time, the patient only experienced mild teratozoospermia.
As part of quality control, 239 patients were assigned four subgroups of surgical interventions and two different established standard anaesthesia.
Changes in retinal pigment epithet in the sense of central seroretinopathy in systemic therapy with corticosteroids should be described.
The X-ray absorption of the pelvis overview has its indication even today in the case of diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in toddler age alongside sonography.
The legs of the toddler must be kept in center position.
Side rotations and increased inclination of the pelvis must be avoided.
Looking back at 150 years, of which 50 years of personally experienced development of Septorhinoplasty, which most recently took a back-development into the 19th century in the "open approach" with flaps of the nose tip.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
Sublabial access to Septorhinoplasty in the sense of minimal traumatic surgery is recommended.
In the imaging diagnostics of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature newborns, the Thoraxröntgen picture is first.
Profound knowledge of the normal Thorax image and the possible physiological peripartal changes are prerequisites for the interpretation of neonatological thoracic absorption.
Childhood pathologies:
A large number of congenital and acquired changes the radiologist faces in neonatology are unknown in the adult patient's radiodiagnostics.
A lot of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or can affect quality of life in his further life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the paediatrician is therefore essential.
Here is an overview of the most important pathologies the radiologist can face in the daily routine.
The primary tumours were mammacarcinomas (n = 34), leiomyosarkomas (n = 20), pancreatic carcinomas (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinomas (n = 13), melanomas (n = 9), stomach carcinomas (n = 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinomas (n = 6), and 14 other tumours.
Extrahepatic tumour infestation (including synchronous primary tumours) existed in 69 of 140 (49%) cases, with the 120 initial resections having an extrahepatic tumour in 51% (n = 61).
Of the 120 first sections, 82 (68%) were ranked as R0, 13 (11%) as R1 and 25 (21%) as R2 resections.
Median survival was 20 months after initial resection, 28 months after R0 resections and 8 months after R1/2 resections.
After second-treatment (n = 14), median survival was 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without extrahepatic tumour at the time of initial liver resection, median survival after R0 resection was 32 months (5-year forecast 25%) and 7 months after R1/2 resection.
The available results show that the resection of non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases promises a predictive gain.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic relapses may even benefit from second or third-party liver resections.
In some cases, impressive long-term outcomes could also be observed in a rather unfavourable starting situation.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be reviewed in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He was unaware of his personality, for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, he suffers massive subarachnoid bleeding from a major aneurysm of the A. communicans anterior.
For the assessment of the guilt ability, this course of action in connection with the testimonial behavioral characteristics, shortly before the fact, therefore, makes the possibility of a sick mental disorder at the point of fact.
This may have been an epileptic twilight condition as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also proven itself, among other things, for elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens dislocated into the glass body.
Due to the high specific weight of PFCL, the IOL is blown up and can be repositioned in the front section of the eye, where it can be refixed for example in the Sulcus ciliaris.
What kind of contact PFCL enters with the IOL is unknown.
Since the biotoxicity of the PFCL is likely to remain longer intraocular, it will be completely removed at the surgical end.
The rare case of solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of chondrosarcoma is reported.
Metastase occurred after a seven-year postoperative interval.
As part of further investigations, no clinically apparatus detectable metastases were found.
However, taking into account the cases described so far, the forecast is very bad.
Developmental anomalies of the pancreas are due to the embryonic formation of the organ and are caused by malfusion (Pankreas divisum) or malrotation (Pankreas anulare) of the two plants.
Pancreas divisum and pancreatic anulars can ultimately only be secured by a gear representation of the pancreatic passage.
In congenital diseases, genetic defects are present, most of which affect other organ systems and where extra-pancreatic damage is usually the focus of the disease.
Both the developmental anomalies of pancreatic disease and congenital diseases lead to a wide range of morphological changes in the organ, which can be recorded with modern imaging techniques.
Books often don't just contain the fabric written by the author.
On the basis of the panel work of Bärensprung and Hebra, it is explained that at the second glance they also recognize some other medically historical facts.
Around 5% of all patients with congenital dwarf fur hernia/defects are asymptomatic at the time of birth and are diagnosed beyond the newborn period.
We report unusual findings in late-present congenital dwarf fur defects, namely association with primary funnel breast and a lethal course in acute stomach volvulus.
The probability of sonography in bacterial coxitis has been reviewed.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), Coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes disease (n = 92) and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) have been studied sonographically.
In the ultrasonic image, the joint capsule, hip head surface and periatric structures can be assessed in the standard sections of the DEGUM.
An intraarticular space requirement (synovialitis, exhaustion) can be captured sonographically as joint capacitance.
This capsule withdrawal was sonographically detected in bacterial coxitis, Coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis and early stage of Perth disease.
Since the joint capillary colonization has no significant differences in the individual illnesses, the sonogram is not possible due to the presence of capsule-distance without annoying changes.
Bacterial coxitis may therefore not be safely distinguished from coxitides of other genes;
Capsule resistance is considered an unspecific sonographical sign.
In case of clinical suspicion of bacterial coxitis, immediate diagnostic pointing is required under sonographic control if necessary.
The epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and the Perthes disease in the condensation and fragmentation stage can be distinguished from both bacterial coxitis and coxitides of other genes due to additional noxious changes in addition to capacitance.
The diagnosis of rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be summarized by clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
As in both cases of gliomatosis cerebri abnormally high degree of dedifferent tumour cells were present, diagnosis was made more difficult by atypical findings such as contrast median absorption in the MRI and clinical signs of intracranial pressure increase.
Clinical history, differential diagnoses and literature are briefly presented.
Various experimental designs such as cohort study, case control study and randomized clinical trial are presented, explained, and issues are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized studies are detailed and illustrated that they are the only way to obtain statements about causal relationships in empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements for clinical research cannot be met by the use of complex statistical procedures, but that good clinical research depends primarily on careful study planning.
The potential impact of anticoagulant therapy through tricyclic antidepressants has been assessed differently so far.
In particular, the anticoagulant phenprocoumone used therapeutically in Germany remains almost unregarded during investigations.
This retrospective study was conducted with a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumone and tricyclics.
Summary From 1.4.1996 to 30.6.1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 were treated with arteriosclerotic, symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenosis through transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
Simultan was performed in a case of thrombodarterectomy of the A. iliaca externa with profundaplasty, in another case angioplasty with stentimation of the A. iliaca communis.
Technical and clinical success was given in all cases.
In a period of observation of median 23 (7-33) there was no closure or clinical residualosis.
Transluminal angioplasty with stentimation in segmental abdominal aortic stenosis represents a little invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
A patient undergoing multi-year sterility treatment and getting pregnant is reported, although she actually did not want a child.
The various species of aspergillus are ubiquitous as pathogens.
Aspergillus flavus has been classified as more apathogenic to humans in the past.
The case of a 72-year-old patient was culturally detected after an aortic bypass surgery at the Aspergillus flavus intensive care unit in the tracheal secretion.
The serological test performed, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and (author:
is "monoclonal antibodies" correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) monoclonal antibodies covered in latex, have been negative several times.
A post mortal aspergillustration with a newer method, the antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive finding.
There was no evidence of systemic infection in clinical and reddening findings.
The patient died before using antifungal therapy, the obduction showed disseminated mycosis of both lungs by aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of more sensitive antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay can facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
Intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B should also be initiated by correct assessment of the pathogenicity of aspergillus flavus with unique cultural evidence of aspergillus flavus in trachea.
The epidemiological data show a decline in appendicitis and appendectomy in industrialized countries.
The age peak is 10-19, but the rate of perforations is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation - especially in young women - and the high rates of perforation among young children and old people show low diagnostic safety.
The analysis of epidemiological data does not allow a clear conclusion to the etiopathogenesis of appendicitis acuta.
After refractive surgery on the corneal and after cataract surgery, ocular image errors (butrations) may occur that cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are likely to be the reason that the maximum retinal-related visus is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
Recording these image errors under clinical conditions would be a first important step towards documentation and correction of these aberrations using modern photorefractive methods.
For both processes, only static unidirectional train load tests had been carried out experimentally.
In this way, Ecke and Hofmann concluded that flexible fixations with respect to rigid processes should achieve a comparable stability and that they should be preferred for the prevention of their ankylosing due to the preservation of mobility in the symphysis.
Through simultaneous multidirectional dynamic experimental analysis under gear simulation conditions, symphysical stabilizations were compared with DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire belts and PDS bandings.
Symphysical preparations were charged in Sagittal and Vertical direction with a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55 500 load changes (steps during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither the wire belting nor the PDS banding were sufficiently stable, with these processes allowing symphysical mobility to reach beyond the physiological limits immediately after the start of the trial.
In the further test course, the instability of the cervical layers and bandings in the bones or fractures of the wire cervical layers generally increased to total failure.
In the DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, however, the stabilization success was dependent on the primary stability of the screw anchorage.
When the screws are primarily rotated, the plate stabilization became increasingly unstable under a dynamic load.
For the primary stable anchoring of the plate screws, the fixation remained stable in full over 55 500 load changes with a load corresponding to the average half body weight.
For clinical use, it can be derived from these results that neither the bridging belt with wire clots nor the PDS banding sufficiently stabilize the ruptured symphysis for early postoperative mobilization under partial load.
If the DC plate or reconstruction plate can primarily achieve a secure stabilization of the ruptured symphysic by good anchoring of the screws in the non-eoporotic bone, the injured person can be mobilized with "open-book injury" with partial load corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOLs) have been implanted with good success for years.
Due to the light split between several focal points, a lower amount of light is available for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or scattered light effects through a capsule fibrosis may lead to visual deterioration early on.
In a 69-year-old patient, a 5 cm large, moderately pleomorphic spinal cell thyroid tumour was initially discarded as primary anaplastic thyroid cancer.
It was not until 17 months later that an anaemia declaration was discovered that a 7 cm-permeating duodenal leiomyosarcoma was discovered and resealed through duodenal leiomyosarcoma.
The reassessment of primary history led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of thyroid tumour as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died 6 months later of an apoplectic insult.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of tumour disease as an intestinal sarcoma, which was initially manifested by thyroid metastasis.
The drug-related therapy of erect dysfunction includes the oral and local application of Pharmaka.
Yohimbin is a centrally effective alpha receptor blocker.
Other oral medicines with a central point of attack include trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine acting significantly better than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both the intraurethral (MUSE) and the intracavernous application are available for local applications.
As a substance used, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely ousted other pharmaceuticals.
At present, several promising substances with a wide range of economic rates and various forms of treatment are present in development as a therapist for erect dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is shown, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They change the patient’s consciousness, contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, which is particularly important for severely disrupted patients who are not sufficiently reachable by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal and death experiences are within their natural reach.
One of the most important long-term adverse reactions of Medulloblastoma therapy in children is a lack of growth hormone.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemo, radiation and hormone therapies led to the establishment of a large number of different strategies summarized under the term immunotherapy.
Remission rates usually range from 20 to 40%.
In addition, 30-40% of patients experience a limited period of stabilization of the disease in individual cases.
Most of these are results of uncontrolled phase II studies.
Healings are usually not expected, long-term emissions are rare (5%), and high remission rates can only be achieved in selective patient groups.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotherapy patients against non- or chemotherapists.
A survival advantage is assured for patients with objective remissions.
Standard therapy cannot be defined at the moment.
Even with the assumption of a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life must be taken into account due to the toxicity of common therapy protocols and their high costs.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in remission rates at present and the survival advantage reported by some authors for immunotherapy patients [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential part of metastatic renal cell cancer therapy.
The use should usually be in clinical trials.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, 262 men (approx.
Calculation of the index includes alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides.
Significant correlations between laboratory indices and biological age arise only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters also correlate significantly with pre-ageing.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL quotient, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
A 2 cm large cystadenofibrome of the appendix epiploica of the distal sigmoid was discovered as a coincidental finding in a hysterectomy with adenexeectomy due to endometrial carcinoma in a 72-year-old patient.
It showed the same histology as analogue tumours of the Ovar and was associated with endosalpingiose.
Extensive increases also existed between the appendices epiploicae and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypes in the peritoneal flush fluid.
These findings are likely to date back to ocular peritoneal endosal pingioses.
Histogenesis, histology and localizations of the primary peritoneal neoplasms of the Müller type are discussed.
In addition to an optimized position of the Patellar tendon transplant, the process was initially hoped for advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, with the superiority of the endoscopic technique not yet proven.
Fifteen endoscopic patients and 14 openly operated patients were examined both preoperatively and postoperatively after 3 and 6 months.
The score systems were collected according to Lysholm and Tegner, ligamentary stability (KT-1000), surgery duration and proprioception based on angle reproduction testing.
The energy dose of spiral computer tomography and the Orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head area using thermoluminescence doses and a phantom head.
The tube performance recommended by the manufacturer of the computer tomograph for a dental CT has been progressively reduced.
A reduction in the radiation load by 76% was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured energy dose of computer tomography was 0.30 mGy (children’s gland) up to 29 mGy (skin surface in the beam) at 187.5 mAs and 1 mm layers (25 mm scanning distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
With reduction to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (child gland) was measured up to 6.9 mGy (skin surface).
Length measurements on sawed jaw preparations were compared with corresponding CT measurements at a workstation.
The average measurement inaccuracy was 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of the CT by about 76% had no effect on length measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the 76% dose-reduced CT scans are still by an average factor 10 above the energy dose of an orthopaedogram.
The importance of enteroviral infection in dilatative cardiomyopathy could only be objectiveized by introducing molecular biology techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in-situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histological and, above all, immuno-histological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in myocardiovascular disease, in patients with clinically suspected diagnosis dilatative cardiomyopathy, enables a division into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilatative cardiomyopathy (no evidence of inflammatory changes in myocardiovascular disease) in accordance with the WHO classification of 1995 (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammation reaction, which can be captured with histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques.
It was only through the combination of histological, immunohistological and molecular biology that a subgroup analysis of the frequency of the detection of enteroviraral RNA in the myocardiocardiopathy of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy was achieved that a subgroup analysis could be carried out regarding the frequency of the detection of enteroviraral RNA in the myocardiocardiopathy of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilatative cardiomyopathy.
In addition to bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic/postoperative), the bacterial endogenous (hematogenetic) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of bacterial, primary chronic sclerotic osteomyelitoids, which, unlike the others, manifests preferably at the keybone.
From the group of 17 patients with Claviculaosteomyelitis we treated from 1978 to 1996, 3 patients with primarily chronic sclerotic osteomyelitis are presented as casuistics.
Differential diagnostics must be taken into account, despite their rare occurrence, the primary chronic sclerotic osteomyelitis of the Clavicula, as it is a domain of conservative, drug therapy after biopneumatic diagnosis.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
Despite modern medicines and surgical treatments, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumours rests on the four columns of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
In the work, a literature analysis examines the role of the total duration of treatment and dose intensity in the optimisation of chemotherapeutic protocols using the example of three important oncological diseases.
Both tumour models and the resulting hypotheses as well as well-designed clinical trials can make progress in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumour diseases.
Castleman is a heterogeneous, histologically defined disease from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative substance, promotes the formation of abnormally stable and dysfunctional micro-tubuli, thereby changing cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration and signal transduction.
This thesis presents the in-vitro and in-vivo results from our research on Paclitaxel.
By comparing 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was favored for in-vivo application.
Based on coloring of the cytoskeleton and electron optics, the paclitaxel effect was detected in the smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall.
In the rabbit, locally applied paclitaxel led to significant inhibition of neo-intimate proliferation and expansion of the vessel diameter compared to ballon dilated control animals.
In additional experiments, a drastic reduction in vascular contracting force was shown according to paclitaxel.
In addition to an age-dependent storage of waste products between the cytoplamsa and basal membranes of the RPE cells ("basal laminar deposits"), various manifestations of early and late AMD such as Drusen, chorioidal neovascularizations and pigment epithet elevations show a breakdown of the fractured membrane between the basal membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer.
Since the various membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, an age-dependent regression of the adhesion apparatus has been established.
More recent research shows that vertebrae dysplasia and spondylolysis arise as a result of disordered spinal growth.
The symptomatic of rheumatic hand-flexor tendon disease depending on the place of lesion and the type of visionaffection to enable early surgical therapy with hand function through improved clinical diagnosis.
For the majority of common dermatoses, suitable animal models are missing.
The transgenic technology created in the 80s closes this gap.
She was initially an instrument in the hand of pure basic scientists, but has also been involved in clinically oriented basic dermatological research for the last five years.
With her, she was able to imitate HIV-associated illnesses as well as geneodermatoses on the murine model and gain insights into their pathogenesis.
Through targeted epidermally localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice had similarities with psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, such mice can be used to investigate the wound healing process.
The transgenic technology also enables the induction of acute tumours.
The presence of animal models of human dermatoses also enables targeted research into experimental forms of therapy, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) in carriers of artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication against the MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic questions, such as processes in the back of the skull, spinal abscess and discomfort inside the knee, can be examined better by the MRI than by other radiological procedures.
The MRI can directly affect patients with artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) Movement and dislocation of flap prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electrical currents, and indirectly by distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of the MRI in carriers of artificial heart valves does not seem sufficient.
Therefore, in 1998, a survey of twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves was conducted regarding compatibility, safety, or contraindication of the MRIs of their respective flap prosthesis.
Some companies relied on unfamiliar investigations, or transferred the responsibility to the doctor who performs the MRI.
Two flap manufacturers explicitly warned of the MRI in certain types of prosthesis.
Based on our survey, we provide an overview of the technical aspects, clinical circumstances and the conditions for MRI safety standards in patients with artificial heart valves.
In an experimental study, an intravenous CO2 or Argon embolism with 10, 20 and 30 ml gas was performed in 10 pigs weighing 18.9 (15-24) kg.
In the Argon group (n = 5), two animals died after 20 and 30 ml of bolus.
Another animal could be successfully revitalized after dose of 30 ml Bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5), neither one of the animals died nor was reanimation required.
Little soluble gases such as Argon should not be used in situations of increased risk of gas embolism.
We report a 56-year-old patient with disseminated granules anular in known diabetic metabolism.
In addition, there was renal failure, which allowed us to refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We performed balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methodoxypsoral full body baths using the foil method, which, after 30 treatments, led to a complete reconstruction of the lesions on the trunk and neck and a clear improvement of skin findings at the extremities.
Adverse reactions did not occur.
Balneophotochemotherapy can affect not only epidermal but also localized processes.
Cat scratch disease (KKK) is a little-known infectious disease in Germany.
Only a few years ago could the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, be isolated.
In most cases, a typical disease is found with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and naming lymphadenopathy.
Less often, further organmanifestations occur.
We report a 47-year-old patient who developed reactive spondarthritis with synovialitides of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the medium and large joints and inflammatory luminaires after a cat bite.
The rheumatic symptomaticism was limited in time and spoke well to NSAR.
To date, only a few cases of joint participation have been described in the context of a KKK.
However, as the disease of cats with bartonella henselae in Europe is high, it could be a more common cause of joint complaints than previously thought.
The diagnostics of the KKK have been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological testing.
We give an overview of clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Through continuous therapy optimisation in recent years, the forecast of Hodgkin has significantly improved.
However, this improvement in overall survival also results in an increase in a large number of possible long-term complications, which the caretaker doctor must be aware of.
Often long-lasting fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, thyroid underfunction, and damage to the gonadal system with azospermia and ovarian insufficiency, most young patients are sustainably affected in their quality of life.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasia is a significant problem after primary successful therapy.
Based on attachment styles as enscribed patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in bond-related situations (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990) was the aim of operationalizing these patterns in accordance with their original definition, i.e. as specific character configurations.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles "safe," "vast" and "ambivalent" were translated into self-descriptions of clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
Based on factor analysis results, three scales were formed:
374 inpatient patients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) filled the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
The cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as binding styles:
"safe," two variants of "unsafe-ambivalent" ("closed" and "sealing") and two variants of "insecure-vast" ("closed" and "ready to cooperate").
The discriminant analysis of these clusters revealed discriminant functions, which were observed by Collins & Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al.
The presence of clinical symptoms of progressive internal hearing loss, fluctuation and the simultaneous radiological detection of an absorbing room demand of the inner ear canal hardens the suspicion of the presence of an acous nerve nerve.
We report a 57-year-old patient with an amnestic known Sharp syndrome and the initially typical finding constellation.
The presented casuistics shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the small brain bridge angle, which expressed itself with a peripheral brain nerve loss in the NO area and initially a lack of central neurology.
Neither primary radiological diagnostics nor the failure of peripheral brain nerves preoperatively suggested the presence of lymphoma.
The fazialisparesis that occurred within a few weeks and the typical ocular cephalgia with radiation to the ear are more unusual for an acous nerve.
A suspective constellation of findings, as in the case we described, must challenge to obtain a differential diagnostic explanation despite current guidance symptoms.
The manifestation of solitary Lymphome in the small brain bridge angle is considered rarity.
As further therapy options, the women’s doctor offers balneotherapy and physiotherapy as primary or supplementary treatment.
In women’s medicine, Balneogynecology has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies as a natural healing procedure.
Balneogynecological and physiotherapeutic measures should be used mainly as supplementary measures.
Only in chronic conditions and acute muscular tension are they suitable for pain reduction and positive tissue influence as primary measures.
The conventional mycobacteria diagnosis requires an average of four weeks until the presence of a positive tuberculosis culture and subsequent sensitivity test.
Until a negative cultural outcome is reported, seven to eight weeks pass.
Faster results are achieved in individual diagnostic steps through new processes such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but they do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The globally disturbing epidemiological situation of the risk of infection for tuberculosis does not give rise to any doubt that the further development of methods is necessary to demonstrate, differentiate and test mycobacteria with high sensitivity and specificity and to test for their sensitivity to antibiotics.
As part of a prospectively randomized study, a non-directional assembly of the small fixater externally of the AO for the therapy of distal radius fracture (A2/A3 according to AO classification) is compared to the supply of percutaneous cherry-wire oesthesia with plaster.
The collection of donated women's milk has a long tradition in Germany.
With modern screening methods, the transmission of infections is excluded.
The incidence of necrotic enterocolitis is low.
Due to their favourable composition, the milk of donors who have children born too early is preferable to very immature premature babies.
In the last 20 years, a large number of daycare centres (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counselling centres (KBSn) have emerged as complementary day care facilities in Germany.
The wide spread of these facilities contrasts with the broad absence of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and their way of working.
In this thesis, 100 visitors were examined by TSn and KBSn in Berlin.
Characteristics of the social situation, psychopathological symptomaticism and the view of visitors were collected.
Almost all visitors had previously been in hospital psychiatric treatment.
The current psychopathological symptoms varyed considerably with a moderate degree of expression.
Two-thirds of visitors were pensioned, most of whom lived alone and had little or no friends.
As positive aspects of the facilities, visitors mentioned, among other things, contact with other people and day structuring.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was disruption by other visitors.
Visitors to TSn were on average younger and exhibited higher levels in the BPRS subscale Anergie.
In addition, visitors to the two facilities hardly differed in the characteristics examined.
The results indicate that both institutions actually provide chronically mentally ill patients with poor social integration, for which they are also conceived.
For these sick, they partly offset deficits in the social net.
Limits and consequences of the results are addressed.
Functional research of the brain was possible for a long time only with nucleic medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
Through the use of rapid imaging sequences, optimized contrast media applications and special reprocessing methods, it was possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes using magnetic resonance tomography (MRI).
With T1 and T2* weighted contrast-assisted imaging sequences, information about tissue perfusion, microcirculation and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be captured using specific models derived from nuclear medicine.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in the tissue can be presented with diffusion weighted MRI, the markrovasculars, dissolved in time, with MR-angiographic techniques.
With MR spectroscopic investigations, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissue can be recorded in several dimensional terms and metabolism processes can be observed over the course of the course.
Advantages of MRI are the low invasiveness, the possibility of three-dimensional representation of the data and any repeatability of the investigation in the absence of radiation load.
The functional methods that are already clinically usable are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of value compared to nucleic medicine methods.
In tumour diagnostics, the functional MR techniques provide important additional information for therapy finding, therapy planning and therapy monitoring.
Initial studies showed that the methods are capable of sensitivizing pathophysiological changes in dementias and psychosis.
It is the declared goal of the World Health Organisation (WHO), in the countries of the European region, even in the light of the constant political and economic change, to settle health protection as much as possible in the consciousness of all.
Health-related environmental factors are to be tackled or better prevented by concrete measures.
It is essential to agree on international standards in the field of environment and health, as well as coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
It is important to ensure that governments and their respective populations develop a Community perception of the important environmental problems.
In the summer of 1997, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a "WHO-Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health" with financial support from the Federal Ministry of Health in Bonn at the Robert Koch Institute.
A 30-year-old patient is reported with a right sided amaurosis fugax with concomitant frontobasal fracture following a fall event.
CT and MR angiography led to the closure of the A. ophthalmica as a result of a division of the A. carotis interna with ascending thrombosing.
Further neurological deficiencies did not exist as sufficient bleeding of cerebri cerebri ceriosus was ensured.
In the aetiological diversity of post-traumatic amauros, such a rare cause should be taken into account, if necessary, as an aetiological, diagnostic and therapeutic factor.
The suspicion of acute aortic elimination requires immediate explanation with appropriate imaging techniques, such as transesophageal echocardiography, computer tomography, nuclear spintomography or aorticography.
In an asymptomatic patient, an asymptomatic patient was echocardiographically suspected of aortic elimination.
Due to the discrepancies in the clinical picture, the angiography was also used alongside other pruning procedures to diagnose the detection of a hometrification of the aneurysmically extended thorta and to definitely exclude an aortic endpoint.
A 54-year-old patient was hospitalized for acute thoracic pain, increased dyspnoea and with the image of right ventricular cardiovascular decompensation.
In the further explanation via echocardiography, a ruptured sinus vasalva aneurysm of the right-wing coroner sail with left-right shunt could be detected in the right forecourt by non-invasive means.
The heart surgery went uncomplicated with the aortic flap.
Six months later, echocardiographically, the right heart sections were usually wide, no shunt was detectable in the color doubler.
Acute cardiac insufficiency may also be the result of congenital heart failure in middle age.
Through echocardiography and especially through transophageal echocardiography, a precise diagnosis could be made by non-invasive methods.
The signs of Nager syndrome are mandibulofazial and extreme malformations.
Lower jaw hypoplasia may cause respiratory obstruction due to concerns of the tongue on the throat background, especially in infant age.
We introduce a patient with Nager syndrome who received nose-CPAP and sedation for over 5 months due to persistent dyspnoea.
After the soft parts had been stretched through extension treatment, lower jaw distractionosteogenesis was performed at a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and cosmetic outcome are good.
respiratory obstructions and dyspnoea were no longer observed after treatment was concluded.
Successful thrombodarteryectomies (TEA) of the A. carotis interna lead to an improved perfusion in the electricity area of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular circulation during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors on the diagnostic-therapeutic approach in the treatment of a specific case of illness using modern telematics.
The practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (next to ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsulting in clinical everyday life is broadly defined, but it is still unclear that this standalone medical service is adequately honoured.
The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of these lenses on vision.
There is no doubt that a psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to a reversible effluvium.
Whether a scarring alopecia can be the immediate consequence of the psoriasis is controversial.
The following we introduce a 38-year-old patient who has suffered from a progressive effluvium in psoriasis herds of capillitium for years.
Histologically impossibly impossible strangular fibrosis in place of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocyte infiltrates in the upper dermis, which overlap in the epithelium of obtained hair follicles and signs of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical course and lack of evidence of another cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenic link between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
The knowledge of this potential relationship is important in that a consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and thus presumably the emergence of scarring.
A reduced production of wax hormones (GH) is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombined growth hormone improves various clinical symptoms including the number of major pain points.
The reduced GH secretion is likely to be caused by an increased tone of somatostatin release in hypothalamus.
The hypothesis is presented that this disturbed GH secretion is caused by intermittent phases of elevated levels of cortisol, which in turn increases the density of the -adrenergenic receptors in hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in the adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin with reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research points to the primary involvement of the dopamine and serotonerous system in the pathogenesis of self-injuring behavior (SVV).
Nevertheless, the efficiency of classical neuroleptics is questionable.
In open and controlled studies, serotonin 2A dopamine D2 antagonist Risperidone also effectively reduced SVV in the longer term.
With the present study, an osteoporosis model should be created by means of ovarianectomy.
Before and after ovulation, osteodensitomy measurements from the upper and lower jaw were performed by DXA.
A clear decrease in bone density after ovarianectomy was shown in both the upper and lower jaws.
10 patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic haemarthros of the knee joint were cleared and treated arthroscopically.
The causes of the bleeding were varied:
In addition to vascular anomalies such as hemangiomas and meniscus lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from arroded subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalasis.
The surgical, usually arthroscopic therapy yielded good results.
Toxic snake bites in children are almost exclusively conditioned by crossots in Germany (Vipera berus).
The crustaceans inject a poison from various enzymes and haemorrhagic and neurotoxic factors.
Crossot bites in children can be symptomatic but also cause severe poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings can be displayed extensively in their surroundings.
The transmission of the sonographical findings to the therapists not present at the examination and the control of a finding, e.g. a tumour, under therapy, are greatly improved.
Viruses have also become more mobile due to increasing human travel speed and activity worldwide.
At the same time, the rapid development of electronic communication technologies is receiving more and more news about epidemics and illnesses from around the world.
This thesis examines the factors that can affect early or late diagnosis of dementia.
We put the indication for surgery in all our cases.
The perforation site was primarily sewn and thoroughly washed and drained.
In 2 cases, the seam was additionally secured by fibrication or with an ovum plastic.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate consequences.
Due to these own results and the evaluation of the current literature, the following conclusions seem to us to be justified:
A definitive surgical procedure is indicated when securing early perforation.
A seam closure of the perforation site should also be tried in case of delayed diagnosis with advanced medianitis.
An additional backup is recommended in these cases.
Resettling procedures with or without concomitant reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high risk of surgery.
The standards and regulations applicable in the MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
Wilms tumours are observed 2 to 8 times more frequently in children with horseshoe kidneys.
Wilms tumours are malignant mixed tissue tumours that rarely exhibit larger fat tissue-containing proportions.
We report a 28-month-old girl with unusual Wilms tumour in a horseshoe kidney who could also have been a Teratom due to a large lipomalous proportion with inland calcifications according to radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in various cutting techniques.
Both differential diagnostics found their correlate in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumour.
Thoracal Actinomycose is a rare disease that is often discarded as malignant.
Due to the high lethality of the untreated actinomycose, this disease must be included early in differential diagnostic considerations.
It reports a 58-year-old patient with 6-month history, blood-sufficient expectoration and significant body weight reduction assigned to us on suspicion of thoracic sarcoma.
The diagnosis of thoracic Actinomycose could only be established through a diagnostic detour.
This was due to an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
With antibiotic treatment, the symptoms of complaint were quickly regulating and ultimately led to the patient’s healing.
Bronchoscopy is also an important part of diagnostics in the differential diagnostics of thoracic space requirements, which include inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcoma-related tumours and germ cell tumours.
In hereditary haemorrhagic teleangectasis (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber), arteriovenous malformations of the liver are rare malformations.
In addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, the systemic consequences, such as hypercircular heart failure, often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old patient in which percutaneous embolization was misused due to unfavourable vascular anatomy is described.
Instead, as a new treatment concept, the adjustable "banding" of liver artery was tested.
After minilaparotomy, an expander prosthesis was created around liver artery and an adaptive throttle of liver artery was performed through the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and heart time volume could be successfully lowered and heart failure treated.
The technique described is therefore an alternative to the ligature of liver artery if percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis has been put in 3% in biopsies of naming diseases in their own investigational material in 20 years.
While puerperal mastitis is presently around 1% in relation to the birth rate, the different forms of nonpuerperal mastitis have come to the fore both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as companion phenomena, most of the mastitides to be diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a broad spectrum of causes.
Only a small part is expression of pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoidosis or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a B-lymphocytic mastitis occurring in diabetes mellitus type I (diabetic mastopathy), in endocrine and rheumatoid diseases, with tumour-shaped fibrosis.
In cases without any characteristics of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and suspected of pathogen-related mastitis, bacteriscopic and microbiological studies should always be performed on the fresh material.
Infectious colitis with grampositive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs preferably in vulnerable or antibiotic treated patients.
We report 2 5 or 14-year-old boys with Clostridium difficile-related colitis, without the mentioned preconditions or a specific underlying illness.
The weaning process, if not organized carefully, extends the duration of mechanical ventilation.
More recent prospective studies show that the application of a corresponding protocol results in an earlier start to weaning and a signi-fiant shortening of mechanical ventilation time.
Both the daily screening of the breathing function as well as attempts at spontaneous breathing are valuable aids that should be included in a weaning protocol.
Once the condition and capacity of the spontaneous breathing is documented, the extubation of the beaten patients should be encouraged, as sufficient evidence shows that 65-70% of beaten patients can be successfully extubated after a spontaneous breathing test.
An excruciating suspension of mechanical ventilation can be taken in patients who have not been successful with spontaneous breathing.
Two randomized studies show that the strategy used to stop mechanical ventilation affects the speed and extent of the weaning success and that the SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
The secondary septohinoplasty in patients with lip-Kiefer-Gaumen columns is designed to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this investigation was to compare the baseline and the surgical result in 30 patients with single-sided LKG columns.
An open rhinoplasty was used to correct the nasal shape.
The soft tissue analysis of the nose was carried out by measuring standardized nose grid photos and the lateral remote crown absorption.
Differentials of the nose symmetry, the nose width and the nose wing approach line were determined by the ideal form.
Measurement of the nasofazial, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurt horizons and the angle between Columella and Frankfurt horizons was assessed.
Anterior rhinomanometry was used for the evaluation of air permeability.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined, and the flow of the gap and non-separation page was compared.
Investigations were conducted immediately before and 6 months after surgery.
In the frontal plane, a significant correction of the nose symmetry and an approximation of the nasal wing inclination comes.
A significant improvement in the tip nasofazial angle and the deep-standing nose wing was not achieved.
Through the intervention, the total flow was increased and a correction of the quotient of the flows of the gap and the non-column side was achieved.
The methods used to assess the aesthetically and functionally relevant findings and thus serve to control quality.
Studies and reports of incidents after manual spinal therapy from 1989 to 1996 were examined.
In literature, there are no correct prospective or retrospective studies of complications associated with manipulative treatment of the spine.
Due to the excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in the assessment of leap joint diseases.
The conventional MRI can be reliable regular and acutely injured ligaments.
However, at the subacute and chronic stage of the injury, the joint fluid is often missing, which is necessary for an exact delimitation of the injured ligaments.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases as the intraarticular KM application displaces the joint space with improved distinguishability of intraarticular structures.
This joint-distance with the MR arthrography is also helpful in the stage evaluation of the Osteochondritis dissecans, as in cases of unstable lesions, a KM flush of the dissekat can be more easily represented.
Finally, due to the high contrast and joint-distance, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intraarticular free joints, which often require surgical treatment.
The MR arthrography, although invasive, provides essential additional information in the investigation of the post-traumatic leap joint as well as various leap joint diseases.
The therapy objective of reanimation must be the social reintegration of humans after acute treatment, ideally the condition before the emergency occurs.
The current study examined the long-term outcome of patients who were reanimated due to an out-of-clinic cardiovascular stalemate of cardiovascular genes in a rural area.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of a strain variability of the V. saphena magna and/or parva type.
Ascension may lead to a migration of the thrombus into the deep vein system through the mouths of the tribal veins in the groin and kneels or via insufficient veins perforantes, which threatens the complication of lung embolism.
Type I covers the varicophlebitis of the veins without the involvement of the mouths of V. saphena magna and/or parva and the deep vein system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfascistly through insufficient Vv. perforantes into the deep veins.
Varicose is only surgically rehabilitated in these cases after aborting acute symptoms.
The surgery involves crossectomy, the extirpation of the tribal veins through separate incision, the exhaires of all various branches and the ligament of insufficient veins perforantes.
In type III, thrombektomy has priority over all other measures through the V.-saphena-magna and/or parva inflammation.
Pachydermodaktyly is an acquired symptomless thickening of the lateral fingers and almost only occurs in young men.
Formal pathogenesis is based on the condition.
Due to their own observations and a literature overview, exogenous factors in the form of forced acts seem to be the main cause of lesions.
Microangiopathic haemolytic anemia (thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purple = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, haemolytic uremic syndrome = HUS) often associated with central nervous system participations.
Typical symptoms include germany, restlessness, confusion, consciousness, cramps or focaleurological failures.
We report a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed acute local psychotherapy with progressive consciousness disorder up to the coma.
Initial cranial computer tomography showed discrete, general brain swelling, which declined regardless of clinical deterioration.
Cranial nuclear spinography was inconspicuous.
In transcranial dopplersonography, generalized flow speed increases (A. cerebri media, anterior and posterior on both sides and A. basilaris) were found.
The causal correlation between flow speed increases and consciousness disorders is likely to be made by observing that clinical improvement was analogous to the reduction of the flow rate increases.
Pathophysiology discusses disruptive prostacycline metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV and leukocyte activation as causes.
The continuous re-examination of the front cruciate cruciate ligaments confirms the accuracy of the patient-adapted procedure.
Although the gold standard for the supply of cruciate ligament injuries is the replacement plastic, reinsertion with autologous reinforcement represents an excellent opportunity for young people.
We report the rare case of a post-traumatic aneurysm of the Truncus brachiocephalicus.
Before that, a blunt Thoraxtrauma had occurred as a result of a traffic accident.
Computer tomography (CT) did not identify the vascular injury.
Patients with cranial rib fractures after stubborn thoracic trauma must be required to avoid a life-threatening vascular injury if possible.
The official German directives on the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now the Robert Cook Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are categorized for their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German directives and differ considerably in some cases.
This short description of the American guidelines aims to provide the clinician with an informed decision-making aid for their own practical activities regarding many everyday but by no means side-by-side problems.
In a 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma, prolonged therapy with Iloprost was performed for 21 days.
The dose was 2 ng/kgKGxmin for 6 days.
The therapy led to an improvement in inflammation parameters, lung function, diffusion capacity and pronounced bleeding disorder.
Due to its central position, the elbow joint is regarded as the most important joint of the upper extremity due to its central position.
Kneading and ligamentary injuries in the area of the proximal forearm confront the treating doctor with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions on the elbow joint, which are accompanied by chronic pain symptoms and movement restrictions, inevitably reduce the useability of the entire arm.
Today, there is little doubt that in most cases a primary definitive osteosynthetic care with exact reconstruction of the joint surface is as indispensable as an early start of physiotherapy exercises.
With the increasing understanding of the anatomic and biomechanical features of the proximal forearm, a major change in therapeutic principles has taken place in the last decades, the current state of affairs is presented in the present work taking into account relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrodes complications can cause fatal consequences.
Manipulation by the patient on subcutaneously located electrodes through the skin can lead to damage to the probe.
We introduce a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrodes and transmuscular subclavia pointing.
This medicine is a development of mycophenolic acid, which was successfully used in patients with psoriasis in the 70s.
The present overview summarizes the mechanism of action and the pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil and summarizes the current experience with this medicine in dermatology.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, the 3D technology today offers the opportunity to analyze structures tomographically in individual steps.
From electronic memory, image levels that are not represented with conventional technology can be reconstructed without problems.
Surface and transparency fashions also allow a plastic representation of stored structures.
With these different representations and the loss-free long-term storage of volumes, the transvaginal 3D sonography sets new standards in the foetal diagnostics of early gravidity.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of a 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbal epidural catheter within 3 h.
Following temporary paresthesia, burning pain in the legs stopped as a result of accidental infusion, combined with motor and sensory innervation loss to segment TH 11. The disease was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications such as the described are usually based on errors, which may not be impossible, but which can be made more unlikely by appropriate measures.
Such measures include the color marking of cables, filters and infusion solutions as well as the use of syringe pumps with a larger drug reservoir to reduce the frequency of the syringe change.
The consideration of alveolar comb profiles and clinical experience show that the transversal dimension in dental implantology has so far been neglected.
In view of a basic evaluation of the impact of jaw height and width, the analysis of 95 toothless ankles from collections that were standardized sawed, measured and classified took place.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length), 1076 implants were simulated on 269 cross-sections and differentiated by implant type, cross-sectional and atrophy class.
Similarly, 24 consecutive implant patients with toothless upper jaws were treated in clinical trials.
An implant insertion on the body jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross-sections, but at sufficient pine height was actually expected in an additional 4.5%.
implant length reductions were additionally necessary in 6%.
This was mainly due to the atrophy class.
Anterior cross-sections offered much cheaper requirements than posteriore.
However, there was no implanatoryness in any of the 24 patients.
Primary insufficient height was present in 22 cases, 2 times a transversal to narrow alveolar comb was detected only under surgery at sufficient height.
The results allow the quantification of the importance of vertical and transversal upper jaw-veal cavity dimension.
This importance is primarily due to bone height, although even at sufficient height reductions in the implant length are often required.
However, both on the body jaw (12% of the cuts with expected implanatory feasibility) and the patient (8%), alveolar comb profiles remain, for which the sole height measurement misleads false circumstances and possibly an exact planned surgical procedure must be aborted.
Complexity and the price of implantological rehabilitation and the scope of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even demand broadly extended mapping measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a new imaging process that can be used to investigate metabolism and non-morphological changes.
Because tumours have increased glycolysis, they can be detected by radiolabelled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proved to be true for different tumour entities.
In this study, PET was studied in the lymph node tagging of urinary bladder cancer.
In 64 patients, a PET of the pelvis was performed preoperatively after injecting fluorescent deoxyglucose (FDG), so that the PET finding could be compared with the history of the surgical preparation after classical surgical lymph nodes stagnation.
positive lymph nodes were correctly detected in 14 patients during lymph nodes tagging;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and a meeting safety of 80% are expected.
Thus, the PET results are encouraging and seem to be better than the classic staging processes, such as CT and MRI.
Among 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis, serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG sub-classes were determined to reveal an immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had subnormal immunoglobuling levels, but 21 patients had immune subclasses.
It affects the decision whether antibiotic therapy and/or immunoglobulin intake is necessary.
If, despite conservative therapy, chronic infections of the nasal cavities persist, a mucosa-skinned nasal cavity surgery is indicated, but this is not the desired success.
An immune subclass deficiency is considered an indicator of a disturbed immune system.
Transitions to severe immune deficiency with malignant development are observed.
We report a 64-year-old patient who had extended erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the hull and right leg during the bladder line.
The clinical and histological image led to the diagnosis of a lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
Treatment with acitretin resulted in a significant decrease in lesions.
The Lichen striatus and his differential diagnoses - particularly the "blocitis of the adult" first described in 1990 - are discussed.
The preservation of potency and urinary incontinence after rectum resections has increased after nerve-saving preparation and full excision of the mesorectum have found proliferation.
Nevertheless, the literature finds postoperative rates of potency disorders and urine incontinencies between 25 and 67%.
Materials and methods:
The autonomous nerve fibres of the pelvis were displayed on 10 bodies and 2 formal infixed, isolated pelvis preparations.
Their location and potential damage locations were displayed and photographed during the surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomous nerves in the pelvis are anatomically clearly defined structures with low inter-individual variability.
The P. mesentericus inferior forms a dense fibre network around the tribe of the A. mesenterica inferior (AMI) on a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral rectum wall and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The front of the rectum is separated only by the denonvillier's fascia from the neurovascular bundle.
The parasympathetic branches of the Sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be insulated via standard surgical access.
1. The nomenclature of the fascia and the course of the autonomous nerves in the small pelvis are not clearly settled in literature.
Highly discontinuing the AMI inevitably results in damage to sympathetic nerve fibres.
3. The close position between rectum and autonomous nerve fibres makes sharp preparation essential under direct sight.
4. Fasciens and nerves can be used as guide structures during preparation.
5. The selective protection of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis cannot be performed through standard surgical access.
The early detection of secondary carcinomas in the primary diagnostics of oral platelet carcinomas is significant for the forecast and pioneering for therapy planning.
In a prospective study, 83 patients with histologically secured primary platelet carcinomas of the oral cavity, the oropharynx and the lipid were pan-scoped from 1993-1998 to check whether this method enables early diagnosis of simultaneous second carcinomas of the upper aerodigestival tract.
The panescopy was initiated with a rigid tracheobronchoscopy, followed by rigid oesophagoscopy.
It followed the endoscopic examination of the Naso, Oro and Hypopharynx.
The result was microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological delimitations were taken from suspect areas.
The share of simultaneous second carcinomas was 8.4%.
Precanceroses could also be diagnosed with the help of pandocopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the clinic and polio clinic for oral, jaw, facial surgery and the tumour center Regensburg (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of secondary carcinomas in a primarius in the "head neck area".
Due to the good experience and the uncomplicated progression, this investigation obviously does not create an additional risk for patients, which is why panescopy can be recommended without limitation for staging in tumours in the head-neck area.
Diagnosing Chorea Huntington can cause significant problems due to the high variability of the clinical picture especially at the beginning of the disease.
We introduce a 21-year-old patient with a secure Chorea Huntington, in which over 7 years the psychopathological changes formed the main symptoms and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
The very early onset of the disease and the significant advance of the onset of the disease were exceptional and thus significantly responsible for the misdiagnosis.
However, the phenomenon of the onset of illness is well documented in the case of the transmission of the mutated gene from the father in literature.
Differential diagnostics were pioneering the attention to the initially subtle characteristics of the patient’s movement pattern and the further detailed survey of the family history.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can be carried out with different focus:
as climate therapy, as (balneo) phototherapy or in a psychosomatic framework.
As certain patient groups benefit from this differently, indications for psychosomatic treatment are drawn up:
This applies to the concomitant presence of a dermatological condition and mental disorder.
Furthermore, such therapy is indicated in dermatoses of mental recovery or with mental participation if depressiveness, functional discomfort, previous emotional strain or psychotherapy motivation are present.
Other dermatoses, not least malignant new skin formations, should also be an indication of inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
The following aims to explain the importance of orthopaedic aids such as bandages and orthosis for dysfunctions in the area of the lateral ligament of the ankle.
The effects of the orthosis described in literature are then explained in relation to joint stabilization, injury prevention and impact of sport performance and proprioceptive abilities.
This thesis deals with long-term changes to cemented polyethylene pans of the Müller type.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to different forms of polyethylene.
The amount of abrasion can be captured by shifting the hip head in the pan.
Within the first few years postoperatively, a relatively high annual head shift occurs by 0.5 mm.
After about 5 years, it commutes to values of 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Head shift values exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavourable for prosthesis.
In this study, a total of 369 hip prostheses determined the centre of the hip head in relation to the marking wire of the pan and the head shift was calculated.
After an average runtime of 77 months, 96% of ceramic heads (n = 109) had abrasion rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
For the metal heads used (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10), this value was only achieved in 71% (n = 260) (runtime 61.5 months).
The polyethylene - ceramic sliding pairing reduces the abrasion by half compared to the pairing of polyethylene metal.
In younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferable.
In the case of unauthorised patients, the indication for the conduction of electrocrampal therapy (EKT), the supervisor is required to perform the healing treatment.
In reference to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, the Hamburg Landgericht had assumed the reasoned risk of a longer-lasting health damage and had affirmed the obligation to permit.
However, electrocrampal therapy is a safe and effective therapy for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychosis, taking into account contraindications.
The use of unilateral short pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and expression of cognitive adverse reactions.
In particular, retrograde amnesia is very rare and occurring in an expression that must be neglected in the light of the dangers of the underlying disease.
According to the authors, it is necessary to deny a legal obligation to authors to authors.
The Maligne hyperthermia (MH) is triggered in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal dominant inheritance, among others, by volatile anaesthesia and succinylcholine.
Due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%), and the genetic variability of the disease, the in vitro contract test (IVKT) represents the "gold standard" of phenotypic diagnostics for MH exposure due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) and genetic variability of the disease.
On the other hand, there is a high link between mutations on the Ryanodin receptor gene (RYR1) and the MH disposition.
After the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) on the RYR1 gene could be detected in an individual of a large family, the presence of this mutation in the other family members and the consistency with the IVKT was of interest.
Ultrasonic diagnostics of malignant Lymphome in childhood are described.
Lymphatic systemic diseases of the child are relatively uniform in sonography:
Initially, lymph nodes and organ enlargements are found, as well as disorder of normal echo texture usually in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
In the parenchymatous organs, the material 4 infiltration patterns are observed:
diffus, small-nodulaire, large-nodulaire and the "Bulcky type".
A therapy success is evident in ultrasonic surgery in the normalization of lymph nodes and organ size, the return of normal organechogenicity and the recurrence of tumor or inflammation related complications.
Differential diagnostics arise from the topographical pattern of distribution and the sonographical appearance of lesions, as well as with some reservations based on the echogenesis and dopplersonographically analysed blood circulation.
The primary diagnosis must always be histologically secured.
Background and questioning.
For the first time described by Grover in 1970, the transitory acantholytic dermatosis is found clinically mostly itchy, edematous or hyperkeratotic papals or papuloves mainly on the hull, which heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
Histologically typical is akantholysis.
To this day, light, sweating and heat are discussed as provocation factors.
