The July issue is traditionally turned in during the Moscow Film Festival, and it is, of course, very sad: proofreading strips when the soul is tearing up for Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we'll tell you about MIFF next time (for now I'll just complain that this year in the minds of the organizers finally strengthened the inexplicable notion that the happy owners of purchased tickets are many times more important to the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle, which does not sin any normal film festival in the world), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is adorned with another nice face - the title character of the Robert Rodriguez-produced "Predators", and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about Christopher Nolan's "Inception" (the man who rebooted "Batman...", by the way), the most - without fools - anticipated movie of the summer.
And this time we also publish the first part of a rather detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here we certainly do not need to advertise anything, and it is clear that the author of "Suspicion" and "The Rope" is our Tatiana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleizerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexei Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina London-carewoman Evelyn Salt, despite the brilliant record, suspected of spying in favor of the Russians and decided to catch at all costs.
Cornered, she will recolor herself in the black we are accustomed to and set out on her own to find the truth.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie as a femme fatale promises to further consolidate the actress' position in the action genre.
She will arrange one traffic accident after another, run on the walls a la "Matrix" and like children scatter strong men in the same strict suits.
That's roughly how beauty is supposed to save the world.
Here he is, the native who blew up and fixed the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.
And at the same time all together turned out to be not a tedious block-buster of the American type about the salvation of mankind, but the nicest living carnival.
What Besson did for 13 years between "The Element..." and "Adele..." I don't want to remember.
He didn't sit idle, to say the least, but all that script-producer hustle and the occasional, tortured directing gig will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." - Hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that 13 years in front of us was not our Besson, but some doppelganger.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, sipped wine in a cafe across the street and composed a story about the most charming adventurer.
To retell the plot (albeit iwobbly outlines), fueling expectations, is more sinful than usual in this case.
The whole incredible drive here is that there are surprises waiting for you around every turn or line.
And all as nice as one.
Either a girl or a vision
THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADELE
The most dashing adventure movie of the decade hints that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele" will start as "Amelie," veer toward <Jurassic Park>, continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy," and end with "Titanic."
The movie is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy's comic books about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Burgoyne had only appeared in three movies before Adelie.
Glorified actress her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a César Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with outstretched hand, begging to appreciate special effects, scenery or stunts, but drags him along like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: "Go, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has seen old movies and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not denying itself cynicism and not shying away from risque
Luc Besson
Starring Louise Bourgoise, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Belle, Gilles Lelouch
SCENE: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city has been rattled by an ancient monster that was awakened to life by an old medium.
The fossil creature is chased by the police, as well as a famous hunter, a pair of scientists from the Museum of Natural History and journalist Adele Blanc-Seck, who has a case not so much to the beast itself, but to the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
COMES OUT JULY 22ND.
"Adele..." - is the case when parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, setting it on a new path.
So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster action movies, with the mentioned "Indiana Jones" (he was both bowed to and ridiculed), and finally with the same "Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this movie is made up of verbal trickery, acting clowning and plot equilibrium (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is organic and strong as never before).
A few words should be said about Adele herself.
She embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress, which takes not so much exploitation of sexuality, but the purest courage and courage.
In movies, these girls are usually assigned to some macho or hairy romantic on duty
TEXT: ALEXANDER SHOOTER
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer, who only twirls underfoot (only his knowledge of zoology proves useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, and has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, completely sour Luc Besson showed unexpected creative dash, reminding that the boundary between the preferences of bored visitors of megamalls and highbrow regulars of art-house halls is easily crossed by films for cheerful madmen.
An adventure movie game without sorrow, fear or reproach
THE DEATH ROOM
Hermetic horror with a claim to psychologism and political context 2002 debut horror film by Jonathan Liebesman was criticized by critics, but liked the public and well earned at the box office, and most importantly - caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director got into the factory, forging new horror on the old molds: Bay set a goal to reshoot in the form of remakes of all the classic horror and commissioned Liebesmanu prequel "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
The critics fiddled again, but the audience loved it again - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new scary" that emphasizes excessive physiological violence.
In general, on its example you can see how the whole genre is convulsing, trying to invent new ways to influence the saturated audience: the naturalistic blood of splatterers merges with the catch-up of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without the liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut feature "The Cube". The movie is made already not Michael Bay.
So in "Death Room" Liebesman was forced to go the other way: dull massacre or monotonous running from a maniac, he preferred a smarter version - almost without the notorious blood, but with a psychological game and riddles.
The evil doctors here are playing cat and mouse with the test subjects.
And three men in a locked room trying to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Playing by the rules and obeying orders from the outside?
Or trying to break your cage at all costs?
Not only they are tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is tested for ruthlessness experienced in wild experiments experienced professor.
SCENE: For $250 dollars, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given each a pile of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the test subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, watched closely behind glass by government agents.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for an outright arthouse
He can make small talk, and he can hit you in the face with a fire extinguisher, but he can't miss a skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is circumspect and adamant in her sympathies.
She is hurt by her father's courtesan lifestyle and openly peeks at the way he, as if parodying a famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels and her father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not the difference of generations or the choice of profession, it is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
The sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan co-directed a comedy with Pavel Bardin with Ivan Urgant called Three and a Snowflake.
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of his growing daughter in the genre of comedy
The fractional plot loops around the love affairs of the characters, who are all the time speculating about psychology, and themselves, apparently by a witty directorial device, emphasize the language of look and gesture.
Secondary plot offshoots (a girl maimed in a car accident, whom Alexei wants to marry, a sportsman-alike played by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are drawn only punctuated.
Especially pathetic is the line about the business of re-buying soccer players, never left out.
SCENE: More than anything else, the agent selling soccer stars is concerned about the fate of his underage daughter Nastia.
The hearty father himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy "with a rod".
What is the businessman's disappointment when Nastya, in her struggle for independence and in spite of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the audience of the movie, the author hit the nines: "Don't look for a problem where there is none". You couldn't be more precise.
Their similarities are simply uncanny.
In both tapes act squads of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who set them up and in each company turns out to be one beautiful girl.
The characters bounce around virtually the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - here and there, something full of dollar bills explodes and a whirlwind of bucks descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed up in expensive suits, are not easy to distinguish from each other (played in both cases by the Patricks - Jason Patric here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to make a movie about dance battles - "Brotherhood of Dance".
Chris Evans was recently called up to play another comic book character: he'll be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that ran in the '70s and was rebooted in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan by an '80s sitcom.
It's just amazing how they, without collusion, brought different material to a completely identical rumbling denominator, making pretty heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies that evoke a lot of Willis and Schwarzenegger pictures (comparisons are invariably in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between these two tapes, "Losers" looks a bit prettier and is clearly the poorer in terms of efficiency (the budget is three and a half times smaller, after all).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who looks good with a bazooka.
Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short.
SCENE: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA are framed by their own superiors: a helicopter with children they were trying to save is blown up, and the soldiers themselves are considered dead from that moment on.
But they're alive - and determined to exact revenge at all costs on the scoundrel with the languid voice who set it all up.
It's all nice, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life on White's painting is only worth it if you have absolutely no better options.
A recycled, conventionally edible action movie
The simple story of an escaped Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only these data at hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the painting and even some specific details of the form.
Without any doubt, the movie promises to be poignantly social.
Certainly it will be realistic, and tough at that.
There is a high probability of non-professional actors participating.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival winners prove from movie to movie, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily take what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who in the early 80's were lectured about Bresson
The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin IFF.
The script is based on a play by Andreea Valean, whose work is particularly favored by directors of the Romanian New Wave.
Cameraman Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All of the above is also true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - please understand us correctly - it is not a scolding, but a recommendation: the Romanian "new wave" is at that blissful stage of development when its representatives believe in the methods of the "new wave".
of his work has yet to be shaken.
And this moment must be caught: it is only thanks to this faith that one can endure the hour and a half spectacle of a Romanian juvenile detention center and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pistereanu (whose history, despite the gulf separating the two cultures, can be easily recognized as the most talented in the world).
convert it into an exploitation a la the 70s, with a cowboy deciding to take a walk from the prison, where he's about to get out, to the nearest saloon).
ROLE: Gheorghe Pistereanu, Ada Condescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: After serving his four years, 18-year-old convict Silviu (Pistereanu) is about to be released, but unexpectedly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From that point on, the young man's behavior becomes maladaptive.
An affair with social worker Anna further spurs the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the picture.
What a load of nonsense!
You want to watch it, watch it.
Not a bad debut, inspiring a faint hope that a decent direction will someday grow out of Romanian arthouse
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-writer Reno is made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible for all of "Ice Age," "Horton" and "Robots," among others.
"Ugly I" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch in the ZO), especially if you like when different objects now and then try to jump off the screen into the hall), tolerably written, and, most importantly, there is not a single below-the-belt joke, because of which on "Ice Age" had to shamefully squeeze into the chair and cover children's ears with their hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn is dictated by the unwillingness to touch the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the basic collision of single parenthood, is responsible for the rather harsh black humor (which, we'd like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
All in all, it's a very likeable movie - so much so that at some points it proves to be even too perfect and right.
One can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought out every detail so that the movie would appeal to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see children's cartoon characters get eaten by cannibals or ruined by an atomic explosion
PLOT: Nosy villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of space exploration have transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to enlist the help of children to execute his grand plan and eliminate a young rival.
In a certain advanced orphanage he adopts three female orphans - Margot with glasses, Edith with a hat and Agnes, who is comparable only to the kitty from "Shrek".
As is usually the case, children transform the plans of adults in an instant.
The main character is drawn from Christopher Meledandri - both are bald, nasal, and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances Travolta's part.
A car rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of the conditional desert, and three pairs of good tits emerge from it.
That's right.
The bearers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently fixes its attention on that part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately announce the good news - the whole movie is in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the right things about female beauty and has cast it in such a way that what happens on screen is of secondary importance.
And there's a lot of fun stuff going on.
"Brokeress," "hitwoman," and "stripper" are digging in the sand, dousing themselves with water (don't ask why), talking some bullshit, and occasionally fighting absolutely fiercely.
The creators think that a motherfucking chick with generous forms, covered in mud, with a smashed nose and shining white teeth is cool.
"Bitch Stuff" is primarily geared toward classic sexploitation tapes.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of "Xena -- Warrior Queen" and "The Amazing Wanderings of Hercules."
A closely related movie in the Moscow box office is "Gun for Jennifer."
It's also cool when a bitchy hottie busts a thug's balls, a fucking punk fights a Japanese schoolgirl, there's a samurai sword and lesbian sex involved; and the intrigue is spun through endless flashbacks.
All in all, for the movie fetishist, a veritable Klondike of pleasures is found here.
It's clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang were having a lot of fun filming this thrash parody, but the task itself seems rather odd.
If it weren't for the physicality of the actresses, it would have gotten boring by the middle.
We can assume this crap came to us from the adult nighttime channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serialized episodes)
Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez.
SCENE: Three dangerous beauties bring a mob boss to the desert who has a substantial amount of diamonds hidden somewhere in the area.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to claw, fight with each other and periodically arriving from somewhere scumbags, as well as regularly kiss and squeeze.
As the case progresses, it turns out that all three are not who they presented themselves as in the beginning.
Apparently, in the author's opinion, it's even funnier that way.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest picture, "Doomsday," a diluted "Mad Max" for the underprivileged, Marshall gave a serious misfire
A bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shaken confidence.
The new non-politically correct and moody magnum opus doesn't shy away from a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and a ferocious B-movie aesthetic.
There is in the picture and the hooligan courage of "Warrior Dogs", and the animal cruelty of "Descent".
"Marshall's Plan" to cleanse the "peplum" of the buildup of post-Gladiator movie filth generally worked.
In 2011, Kevin MacDonald will present his interpretation of the story of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are rugged men trying to marry their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
Mortality and the piquant details of the fulfillment of natural needs in ancient times are here depicted with love and thoroughness.
The Ninth Legion extermination scene, which took a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening spread in the Germanic forests from Sir Ridley Scott's now benchmarked "Gladiator," but trying to accuse Marshall of plagiarism is somehow completely unnerving: he works honestly and without complaint.
Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey.
SCENE: The lands of modern-day Scotland occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost where Centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is serving is ruthlessly defeated by a Pict scout company.
A miraculously rescued Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion and then, with a bunch of other Roman survivors, try to sneak away from a group of Pict militants led by the sadistic Itain (Kurylenko).
Thin arthouse artist has so far managed to win back in Hollywood only sharp-characteristic roles of the second plan, but I really want to believe that after "Centurion" the situation will change.
Peplum -- edition revised and enlarged.
Almost like "Gladiator," only leaner and tougher.
A continuation of the story of high school girl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young men - pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf-cultured Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's female fans are holding their breath.
A massive movie version of the animated series about a bald-headed boy sorcerer dedicated to bringing peace to the four kingdoms.
The fire lord started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang can only stop him if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) has a knack for stealing other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
By penetrating the subject's sleep, it forces the sleeping brain to work by its own rules.
But this time he's going to have to do the opposite - leave something in one head that wasn't there.
A pictorial lesson in managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds a young assistant in hopes of the two of them defeating an evil magician (Alfred Molina).
Using devastating spells, they will set up a bedlam in the middle of Manhattan with dragons and explosions.
A bald as a billiard ball kitty has plotted to take over the world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second series of the fluffy family comedy.
Several badass thugs, led by the flimsy-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are being hunted for sport by stylish fanged aliens.
The return of an iconic 80s character to the big screen.
Look out for George Clooney, who teams up with rock photographer-now-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a very curious existential study of the psychology of an aging assassin hiding from people in a small Italian town who is late in realizing human nature.
"A visionary artist on the scale of Corbyn and the gorgeous George Clooney is a movie union made in heaven," boasts a studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love affair in Clooney's life - with Italy: filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Booth's novel "A Very Secretive Gentleman" as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the place of the English narrator was taken by an American, who was given in the title, and the main character turned from an illegal gunsmith into a simple murderer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack is trying to solve his last case and finally quit his lucrative trade, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Thekla Ryuten), with whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
"Jack tempts fate," reads the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is coming closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who employs him may well not be who she claims to be."
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, spiced up with Clooney's ashy hair (the movie looks like a long clip of 02), have reached a whole new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will star in the film adaptation of Remarque's "On the Western Front Without Change"
Can I take a picture of you with my gun?!
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at the same time this season.
First, in Venice on the set of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's (The Lives of Others) thriller The Tourist.
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Second, in Puerto Rico on the set of "The Rum Diary," an adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The project is being directed and written by Bruce Robinson ("Whitneyale & Me"), whose last directorial effort was the 1992 thriller "Jennifer 8".
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the domestic prison drama, one can't even doubt what inspired them.
But you can't take the question of realizing an idea literally!
However, it is good at least that the heroine of the Russian picture, although a stranger, but not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four collaborations to their credit: "Lucky Gilmore," "Big Daddy," "Chuck & Larry: Firehouse Wedding," and "Don't Mess With Gohan!".
A fifth comedy, "Classmates," comes out in July, and a sixth, "The Pretender Wife," starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman, is in the works.
The schedule also includes a seventh film, the romantic comedy Jack & Jill, where Sandler is set to play Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughn, remembered by the audience this year's action extravaganza "Kick-Ass", will take on the reboot of the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class" director first called James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepath Emma Frost nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will reincarnate as the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender is expected to become Magneto.
While filming on the new Bond series has been delayed, its new director, Sam Mendes, has been bored out of his mind.
His to-do list includes the musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the film adaptation of Isan McEwesn's novel On the Waterfront.
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of practical Major George Smiley - the protagonist of John LeCaré's series of novels - in the film adaptation of the thriller "Spy, Get Out!".
The first adaptation of this work in 1979 was played by Alec Guinness.
The new version will be shot by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film Let Me In.
Tom Tykwer adapts David Mitchell's bestselling sci-fi novel Cloud Atlas.
By the director's admission, this is not an easy (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but extremely interesting work.
He has already received offers from Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
In the Crimea are shooting international action movie Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune".
It focuses on millionaires who went to a real war for their money in search of adrenaline.
Starring Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The movie is scheduled to premiere in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" alongside British pop star Pixie Lotg
Megan Fox has been fired from "Transformers 3."
As Ragatoipe's movie company assures, the firing "is not related to that interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
However, the place of the main character and the new lover of the hero Shia LaBaffa will most likely take English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley.
The girl doesn't have any movie experience, so she's due for a crash course in acting.
This fact should not frighten the sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinematography there are many examples of successful reclassification of models in actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monstro"), Angelina Jolie ("Life Interrupted"), Jessica Lange ("Blue Sky," "Tootsie"), Kim Basinger ("Secrets of Los Angeles"), Jennifer Connelly ("Mind Games"), Geena Davis ("The Accidental Tourist") and "First Vice Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") started out as models or shot for fashion magazines, eventually received a well-deserved "Oscar".
Succeeded in acting (also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Belucci and, most pleasantly, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
High honors are clearly at arm's length for them.
In short, Rosie has someone to look up to.
Valeria Gai Germanica, who earned a Special Mention from the Cannes Jury in 2008 for her film "Everybody Dies and I Will Stay" and directed the scandalous TV series "School", has been appointed Creative Director at the MT TV channel.
The management of the channel believes that it is Valeria who will succeed in bringing the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or vampires).
Germanica has also begun casting new presenters.
Comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into "Vykrutasy".
The main theme of the movie remained the same - provincial teacher of Russian language Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) hurries to Moscow to his fiancée, but is delayed to coach a soccer team of street children.
The second storyline of the picture has a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina role of the capital bride Nadia will perform Milla Iovovich.
As an added intrigue, a third will appear - Nadia's ex-fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
So, aside from the question of whether the backyard team will win the soccer championship, there is the dilemma of who gets Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in filming "The Hobbit" and the presence of a mass of side projects Guillermo del Toro gave up the position of director.
The studios are persuading producer Peter Jackson to take matters fully into his own hands, but he's only willing to take that step if it's absolutely necessary.
David Yates, who finished shooting the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film "District 9," produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination, are mentioned as possible successors.
The new director will be officially named at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra.
Overwhelmed by the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers at super speeds ran between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the hotel "Pearl", where the stream of press conferences and round tables, barely had time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films behaved as well - in almost every film someone was running somewhere: the confused Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Gastarbeiter" and Dmitry Mamulia's "Another Sky" were looking for their missing grandson and wife, the fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's "To Live"
The same cops happily circled around the finger hero detective Klim Shipenko "Who am I?" - which, however, remembered by the public rather the presence in the frame of the total nude Jeanne Friske.
Appeared heroes of domestic show business and a couple more competitive films - in the film "Elephant" Sergei Shnurov played a trucker, taking a circus animal to slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets argued on favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film production for two "Satisfaction", where business partners called each other to alkoduel because of the lady.
However, and business events at Kinotavr carried a tangible imprint of the show - was not bored at any of them.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of Russian arthouse, a picturesque quarrel with the critics arranged by the chairman of the fund to support domestic cinema Sergei Tolstikov: "Do you even read the articles in the press, which I read?" - he menacingly asked the audience.
"I write them," replied confusedly the president of ERVEZS! Andrei Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko's film "Ovsyanki" was suddenly withdrawn from the competition program - it will go to Venice: Mostra's selectors decided that the extra Russian screening was a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinotavr has not interfered with giants - films from big festivals have been shown in Sochi many times: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film "My Happiness", which competed with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun on the Cote d'Azur in the spring, took part in the competition.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the movie of a former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, did not like Loznitsa's picture at all, but under pressure from his colleagues he was forced to give it the prize for directing.
The award for best debut, "Missing in Action," went to a daughter
A gruesome movie encyclopedia of Russian life: the naive humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked into monstrous acts for no apparent purpose.
A finely choreographed, cleansing movie experience directed by a misanthrope with a math background that appeals to only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a background in philosophy, Mamoulia calls the films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any event in the script, and claims that the viewer's joy is in the labor of comprehending his sparse meditative films.
The most difficult picture of Kinotavr has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - a director's star has been born.
Impeccably dressed and cut programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained squeamishness, hiding in a burrow of neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, the unjust hand of the punitive organs descends on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's good to work with more than just debutants," producer Sabina Yeremeeva said triumphantly from the stage as she picked up the prize.
Critics felt otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull the "inner debutante" from the corypheus of domestic art cinema.
And it is symptomatic - nowadays in our movie bison are moving after the youth.
Not the other way around.
A documentary filmed in a way that blows your head off more than a similar fiction movie.
The author is interested in a screwdriver examining an electric meter and a piece of unsalted butter drifting across a cast-iron skillet -- all of which turn the story of an unemployed miner, his sparse-toothed lover and her criminal brother into a veritable doc-crawl of butter.
Nikolai Sokolov, winner of the short meter contest, tries on the black-and-white stylistics of the French New Wave to the world of bedroom neighborhoods.
Let Godarov's montage moves in the story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, look strange, but for a rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality - thank you.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircrafts such as AN-12, IL-18, AN-32, AN-24, equipped for the time of work with meteorological equipment and technical means of impact on clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological pyropatrons with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process looks as follows: airplanes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break" the clouds coming to the city with these reagents. Particles of the substances condense moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation is falling earlier than planned and exactly where the cloud impact occurred."
A remake of the science fiction movie starring Michael Iork has been in the works for about ten years now.
Carl Rinsch (he already has a remake of "Creatures of the Black Lagoon" on his schedule), who is famous for his commercials, was recently appointed director.
Previously, Bryan Singer ("X-Men"), James McTeague (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski ("Tron: Legacy") were linked to the project.
In the story, the protagonist, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee a death sentence because a future society executes all citizens upon reaching that age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the '80s rotoscoped fantasy cartoon and plans to make it into a major motion picture.
The original was a co-creation between director Ralph Bakshi (The Lord of the Rings m/f, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic, and lots of drawn boobs.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Tigra and all the people from the evil ice lord Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay close attention to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will be sending his zombies on vacation for the near future, as 1 himself plans to tackle the remake of Dario Argento's classic jallo picture.
The characters will be brought back to wide screens by none other than Michael Bay, the master of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damin Chen and he will also adapt the screenplay.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and shot "Two Evil Eyes" together in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the movie and writing the script.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur"
"I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China," says Chen.
- Chinese women these days are running big businesses and winning Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies that strength."
For the second time in a row, you're playing an imaginary character.
Is this an accident?
Regularity.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two pictures here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE).
And I play a dream woman in both.
But, uh. that's how the director saw me, that's how I was presented, and many people probably think that's how I am in life.
Dream Girl.
Your partner in the movie Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his hero.
How did you two find common ground? What's he like on the court?
He is absolutely not what he appears to be at first glance.
At first I saw him and I thought, "Yeah. this isn't gonna be easy for me."
I guess without human contact, sincere and real, we wouldn't have made it.
And we had that contact just minutes after we met.
We've become, I don't mind saying, great friends.
I told him about all my fears, about all my worries, that I was afraid that I would fail, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he was happy to give me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do that because I was very afraid of losing that contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere, we watched the whole movie holding hands.
How was the shooting in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I've never had a tour there, not on vacation or as a kid, I never went there.
This city has a special magic, some kind of its own character, its own charisma.
And it's a city you want to come back to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry to get anywhere and always has time for everything.
So it wasn't hard for you to play your crush on this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which many, frankly speaking, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Do you find emotional scenes easy?
You know, I'm a non-professional actor.
And I'm a very, by nature, trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with a director, I actually put myself in his hands and I want to be the dough that will be molded.
I understand perfectly well that I can see from the outside, and I, again, ask for hints and talk to the director, very long, not even I talk to him, but he has preliminary conversations with me and explains to me very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then through long hours of rehearsal we come to that organicism you're talking about.
And how did you work with the director of the picture Klim Shipenko?
I was getting high from everyone, the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I have so much fun working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready to not sleep, not eat - and here was exactly the same situation.
No sleep, no food for 24 hours - and still, even thunder, even hail.
And if something didn't work out - it was a disaster, and something must be done urgently to make it work.
It's very easy to work in this atmosphere of craziness.
And it seems to me that when people are so moved to the point of morbid fanaticism at what they're doing, it can't fail because too much energy is expended.
What scenarios are you giving up?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you have to work with?
I don't want nonsense, silly dialog, movies that say nothing, carry nothing.
I don't want to work just to be on the screen one more time.
Do you have any proposals, projects you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans at this time.
I'm not a person who spells out charts.
The script came in, I was interested in it, and that premiere happened today.

Report from the set of Tony Scott's new thriller, in which Denzel Washington saves the world again
PUBLICITY BOOTH
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are going on almost continuously in Moscow: Amfest, 2torgo\, the American film festival, 2-t-1 will start the other day, followed by the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half the people I know are constantly discussing that someone should be boycotted and someone should be supported, for some - well, sorry - very vague reason.
At the same time, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed by a horrifying-looking Chu4 projection without English subtitles, nobody seems to notice anything.
The last thing you want to do is grouch about it, but if you stay in the audience to look at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors after buying a ticket with your money, that's the way you're going to be shown.
In the meantime, we have no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a sequel to the classic virtual reality film), "Let Me In. Saga" (an American remake of a great Swedish movie), "Out of Control" (another Tony Scott approach to the theme of trains) and a wildly detailed account of how the movies about Conan, the barbarian, the destroyer and the governor were made.

the multi-part tale of the lovable witch doctor is nearing completion.
And even though fans of the series have already read the book and know how it ends, and those to whom the word "Expelliarmus" does not mean anything will stay at home, the title of the main blockbuster of November for Harry is actually booked.
The studios, by the way, are not fools either: in order to stretch the audience's pleasure and lastly squeeze the maximum out of the franchise, the seventh movie decided to split into two parts.
So a sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will stretch into next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
History of the creation of Facebook
David Fincher's new movie is first and foremost a story about paradox.
The picture tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools of the Internet, which united the whole world, broke up five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of the last decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the title role is as brilliant as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of exasperation with the world around him, partly out of sporting interest, and partly simply because THIS is "cool."
The idea itself and its realization may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "The Social Network" are evident from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his five-minute ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's ringing, hard-hitting dialogues gain momentum here and don't soften until the finale.
Same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins played by unlikeable actors.
The face of one was superimposed on the other using computer graphics.
At the same time as Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman was studying at Harvard.
Rooney Mara has landed the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
David Fincher
Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ernie Hammer, Joshua Pence.
SCENE: Mark Zuckerberg, a sullen and withdrawn Harvard student, after receiving a turnaround on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with few companion friends begin to fray and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sunny in places, even in the darkness remaining cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two detached lawsuits.
Not much happens in the movie outside of the flow of incessant discussions: no deaths, no murders, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to even warrant an additional paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted Sorkin, 49, and Fincher, 48, to this not-so-generous on details story?
After watching it, there is a strong feeling that "The Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic device.
Just some twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing roughly the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big business.
Now that daily solvency has gotten even higher, policy is no longer made in board meetings, av sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of being the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are stomping their feet: who says the rich, handsome and athletic can't also be smart?
(This line is particularly amusing to Fincher.)
The Social Network could very well make a black comedy if it wanted to.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more to his cause, positive or negative?
And what are the social consequences of its invention?
He's a con man?
Or a devious manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin would never close a book if there was even the slightest hint of something like that in it.
But it won't even be necessary here: it doesn't matter at all in their version of the story.
"How does it feel to feel beautiful?" - asks in Tre VeaNez's song "VaBu Wat'te A Vsp Map," which precedes the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The movie suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is representative of a lost online generation that has a poor understanding of beauty and an even poorer understanding of feelings.
A tastefully crafted character drama about a high-profile Internet-era trial
At the beginning of the XVII century, when Ivan Susanin lived, the surnames of people of unknown origin had not yet begun to appear.
They used the name "such-and-such, such-and-such's son".
That is, patronyms - nicknames after the father - were in use.
But sometimes, for example in the case of remarriages of the father, a matronym, a nickname after the mother's name, was used.
Susanin is just such a case, "Ivan, son of Susanna."
Serfs of small landlords really for a long time did without surnames - what for it, when you have 20 souls and everyone is always in sight.
But owners of estates of many thousands were forced to give their peasants family names.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already in the beginning of the XVIII century had surnames all over the place.
In the XIX century, even small landlords did not keep a man on the land, but let him go for a share - let him earn money by craft and pay the master.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where he had to write his surname.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs had been released on a sharecropping basis.
Which means they already had last names.
Moscow forensic experts flew in to investigate Novosibirsk explosion
Criminalists of the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the case of a gas explosion in the house on Lineynaya, 39, reports NGS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Evgeny Kavun, presenting themselves as employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, were sloppy in their work and, on the contrary, overcharged for their services, the agency reported, citing a knowledgeable source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineynaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments of the house No. 39, where they were changing the hoses of the stoves.
So, in one of the apartments, they put a water hose instead of a gas hose.
Kavun, however, denies it.
According to him, this is impossible, everything has been certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant building collapse that killed 13 people.
Earlier arrested suspects in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The crooks themselves came from Omsk.
Sea surge flooding has been avoided in St. Petersburg
Arguments of the Week.
St. Petersburg → Society

Experts were able to prevent flooding by closing the dam a day earlier.
The threat of flooding in St. Petersburg rose sharply Friday due to inclement weather in the city.
Sea surge flooding was prevented by the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flooding could be the 32nd in a row, the St. Petersburg-based publication Neva.Tudei reported.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water was kept at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of dangerous flood levels (161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can sail through the Gulf of Finland again.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland monitor the situation with the water level.
This prevents the flooding that can follow an increase in winds.
In Turkey, 8 arrested in case of deficiencies in collapsed buildings
Eight people have been arrested in Turkey's Şanlıurfa province in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed in an earthquake.
As Armenpress reports, Habertürk informs about it.
The earthquake recorded in Turkey on February 6 killed more than 20,000 people.
The number of injured exceeds 80,000.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of tremors that were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to Iran's supreme leader and the country's president
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Seyyed Ali Khamenei and President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ebrahim Raisi on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
This was reported to Armenpress in the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
In a message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Seyyed Ali Khamenei said:
"Your Eminence,
I cordially congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions have special significance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing sustainable and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations hardened in the atmosphere of mutual respect and trust will have even greater achievements in the future for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
I take this opportunity to wish you good health and many years of life."
The congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi reads in part, "Your Excellency, please accept my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relations, based on centuries-old history and mutual respect, are of special significance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of our joint efforts we will be able to bring to a new level of interstate cooperation, the multisectoral agenda of which will be further expanded for the benefit of the welfare of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Emphasizing the importance of our views on the establishment and strengthening of regional peace and stability, I reiterate the official invitation addressed to you during my visit to Tehran last year to visit Armenia.
I take this opportunity to wish you new achievements and stable peace to the friendly people of Iran".

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, a World War II-era aerial bomb exploded Friday in the port town of Great Yarmouth as bomb disposal workers were trying to defuse it.
The powerful explosion was heard dozens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began to defuse it.
Fortunately, all personnel are intact.
Agencies have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Assistant Police Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Locals write in social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 kilometers.

Photo caption: The explosion occurred contrary to the bomb squad's plans, but there were no fatalities or injuries
The 250-kilogram bomb was found during building work on the banks of the River Yare, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea coast, Great Yarmouth stands.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective rampart of sand around it, and a cordon, with no outsiders allowed inside, was set up 200 meters away.
The bomb technicians initially intended to use a robot to cut the fuse off the bomb on Thursday, but the attempt failed, so they decided, according to the local press, to use the technique of "slow burning" the explosives.
It was in the process of this burning that the explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from the fall of 1940 to the spring of 1941, known as the Blitz, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain alone.
Women account for almost 40% of Belarusian researchers
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, researcher of the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences Alesya Solovei told BELTA.
The share of women among candidates and doctors of sciences is also increasing: 41.1% of candidates and 21% of doctors of sciences are women.
In all fields of science, except technical sciences, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized field of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which the share of women is 64.4%.
Only in the technical sciences are men predominant, with women accounting for 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1%, which is 10.2% more than in the country as a whole.
Among candidates of sciences the share of women is 46%, among doctors of sciences - 20%.
More than half of the teaching staff in higher education institutions are women (57%).
Among vice-rectors for scientific, academic and educational work every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
Senior lecturers and teachers are the most female, over 60%.
The share of women is also high among associate professors in the chairs (55.2%).
According to the republican monitoring of public opinion conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagreed with the gender stereotype "science is a male domain" to a greater or lesser extent.
More than half of residents do not hold the view that women are less competent as scientists - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"Transformation in the mass consciousness of gender perceptions of women's research competence contributes to the involvement of young women in science, the development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful role model of a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," - said Alesya Solovey.
February 11 is the annual International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The celebration was established to introduce women and girls to science, encourage women to pursue careers in science and recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the world's researchers.
The probability of further increase in the key rate is higher than its reduction
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep the rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that there have been important changes recently.
On the one hand, the terms of foreign trade have noticeably deteriorated - Russian oil prices have fallen.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains subdued, private investment is slowing down, but budget expenditures are growing.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks have generally increased.
"So this year, the likelihood of a rate hike is greater than the likelihood of a rate cut.
The expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," Nabiullina said.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, a rapid unwinding of consumption in an environment of heightened inflationary expectations, in case the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Second, the increasing shortage of labor and the lag between productivity growth and wage growth.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5 - 7%.
This may require a higher key rate trajectory than anticipated in October, she said.
In the Central Bank's updated forecast for this year and next year, the ranges for the average key rate are raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% p.a. for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% p.a. for 2024.
"That doesn't rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and magnitude have diminished.
On the contrary, the probability has increased that some rate hikes may be needed in order for inflation to meet the target of around 4% in 2024," the Bank of Russia governor concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved requirements for the procedure for the establishment of special closed-end unit investment funds (UIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from the existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow to launch the management of the remaining liquid assets and resume operations with investment units.
If a retail mutual fund contains more than 10% of blocked securities, the management company must segregate them into a separate closed-end mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued units of the new fund in an amount equal to the units of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed-end fund.
For funds with less than 10% of blocked securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders of the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, in case of realization of such securities, management companies are obliged to pay quarterly to owners of investment units not less than 90% of the proceeds, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summarizing the results of the industry, the experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analysis and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia, air passenger turnover decreased by 6.3% and passenger transportation by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger transportation amounted to 95.2 million people and passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% below the level of the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
BCOP analysts note that the relative resilience of the industry has been influenced by government support programs.
In 2022 there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles was allocated.
Tourists could get partial refunds for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
Also, to ensure the availability of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidies for the transportation of citizens, development of regional transportation, etc. with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to additional capitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as continued subsidization of the industry by the state (so far allocated 25.3 billion rubles) in 2023 passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4% to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviatsia, to 103.0 million people," - share forecasts analysts PSB.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed at high speed into a bus stop.
Six other people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot and killed on the spot.
It was later revealed to be a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions were classified by law enforcement as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained and the house was sealed.
At the same time, Israeli media reports said the attacker had mental health issues, only to be released from the hospital this week.
Austria is again tightening controls at its border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people are staying at the border in cars waiting to cross to the Austrian side.
It thus becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing arrangements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to stay in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those who want to cross the border: many migrants fall victim to smugglers and end up between the two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, more control is needed.
The decision to tighten inspections by Vienna followed a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more money for cameras, drones and watchtowers to secure the commonwealth's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of irregular migrants arriving in the EU and requesting refugee status exceeded the 2016 figures for the first time and amounted to more than 330,000.
Cargo "Progress 83" successfully docked to the ISS
The Progress 83 automated resupply ship successfully docked with the International Space Station at 3:45 GMT on Saturday, ending a two-day orbital mission.
The docking occurred 269 statute miles above the South Pacific Ocean.
The docking was broadcast by NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Mission Control Center.
Cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina greeted the cargo ship from the ISS.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered meals for Russian cosmonauts.
"Progress 83" successfully launched from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported depressurization of the Progress MS-21, prepared for undocking from the ISS and further flooding on February 18.
As specified in the press service of the company, the transition hatch of the ship was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
Also in the control center reported that the ISS crew is not threatened by anything: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal.
The crew's life and health are not threatened, they are feeling well".
"There has been an increase in maternity tourism."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child but did not remain living in the country.
Earlier, the republic's authorities denied entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of arriving for "maternity tourism" purposes.
On February 11, they were still allowed into Argentina by court order.
Read more - in the material "Gazeta.Ru".
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits (VNZh) of Russians who obtained them through the birth of a child, but did not remain living in the country.
Service director Florencia Carignano told C5N television channel.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who have come to get a residence permit because their child is Argentinean, but have spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for the Russian will be considered in court, the migration service will file data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came back."
Carignano warned that Russians who obtained a residence permit after having a child and left could have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina because of the refusal to enter the country.
According to the head of the consular section of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission connects the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls at the entry, incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, two more - in the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women have flown to Argentina, but specifically these three have been issued a no-entry order.
"They were not allowed into the country under the migration law, where one of the grounds for not being allowed into the country is providing incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, Argentina's migration service allowed pregnant Russian nationals into the country by court order, lawyer Christian Rubilar said.
"An hour ago they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quoted him as saying.
Rubilar said the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport from the Republic.
It allows short-term travel to 171 countries without visas, including EU states, the UK and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian wrote about a "boom in maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polin, between 2,000 and 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic in 2022.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women about to give birth there.
"In 2023, that number could rise to 10,000," he said.
For her part, Carignano previously claimed that about 10,500 Russian citizens arrived in Argentina in 2022, and more than 5,800 pregnant women have arrived in recent months.
On February 9 it became known how prices for rent in St. Petersburg have changed.
It's down 10% in price.
At the same time it is known that across the country rent became more expensive by 25%, reports Patrol Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles a month, a studio - 22,000 rubles a month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have traveled abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country became known.
The Argentine Migration Service has prevented six pregnant Russian women from entering the country because the purpose of their visit, which they had indicated, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the TV channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them confessed that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, the country's representatives did not let the Russian women into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure for action if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
Thus, if it is noticeable that a woman is 33 weeks pregnant, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly talk about where she is going to go on vacation, she immediately falls under the suspicion of the migration service.
Moreover, experts specify that it is difficult to be a traveler "under these conditions."
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.

The People's Artist of the Russian Federation specified that back in 2022 he ran out of contract.
All the details were agreed upon with theater representatives long ago.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew his contract.
Filippenko noted that the superiors went to the meeting and prepared all the documents.
Thus, he assures that he has "not let anyone down."
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is going to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, at the moment the film actor in the Moscow theater works as a guest actor.

Kirkorov won a lawsuit against a fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed the artist's construction was illegal, but he did not show up for the hearing.
The fisherman sued music performer Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha near Moscow.
About it writes "Channel Five".
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, the court was presented documents, design projects, which confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's house.
As the head of the law firm Alexander Dobrovinskoi specifies, the construction of the pier left the plaintiff no chance to go fishing.
The bid for the performer was submitted on Jan. 11.
The star attorney jokingly said that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the entertainer's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinskoi specified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from that spot there was an opportunity to spinning further.
A somnologist has identified the causes of sleep problems
Doctor-somnologist Sofia Cherkasova told about the foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems are often caused by products containing caffeine.
We are primarily talking about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, as they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "jagged", and therefore do not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop consuming caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and as a consequence - there are difficulties with falling asleep.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor specifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disturbances such as shallow sleep and frequent night wakings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends avoiding spicy foods of voluminous portions.
Large amounts and spicy foods contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall into sleep.
Healthy sleep requires not only compliance with the external temperature regime - the optimal temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova should not be abused and heavy food before bedtime, because it will not give the body a full recovery and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and usual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.

Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media reported.

Depressurization of Progress MS-21 occurred on the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported depressurization of the Progress MS-21 prepared for undocking from the ISS, the Kazinform news agency reports with reference to TASS.
"The contour of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship, the sinking of which is scheduled for February 18, is depressurized, confirmed the telemetry data received by the TsUP," the Roscosmos press service said.
As noted, it is currently isolated from the overall plant volume.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, it did not affect either the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the future ISS flight program.
Sergey Krikalev, executive director of Roscosmos for manned space programs, commented on the situation.
"On the cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months, there was a coolant leak from the thermal management system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to our ship (Soyuz MS-22 - TASS note) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the Soyuz incident concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will analyze to make sure there are no problems in the next launches.
"We need to do an in-depth analysis to make sure that this cause does not extend to similar designs on future launches.
That is the most important task that we will face now," he said.
According to the executive director, there is analysis to be done in terms of the preparation of the ship for launch, the materials that were used, and the technology that was used to assemble the radiator.
The same analysis was performed in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," Krikalev added.
The Executive Director clarified that a committee began work on Saturday to analyze all possible causes.
"The ship was supposed to undock and descend from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft ("Soyuz MS-23" - TASS note), so there will be serious consequences on the actions of the crew, on the work of the crew.... It will not affect the program from this point of view," Krikalev noted.
The Progress MS-21 freighter was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the small research module "Poisk" of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kilograms of cargo to the ISS.
NASA has named the location of the Progress depressurization
Depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship on the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal management system.
This was announced by a representative of the U.S. Mission Control Center (MCC) during talks with the ISS crew, broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from the Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all of the refrigerant is completely out.
"This morning we had a refrigerant leak from the thermoregulation system into space, the refrigerant leak has stopped," said a spokesman for the U.S. MCC (quoted by Interfax).
Earlier, the Progress circuit was isolated due to depressurization.
Roscosmos reported that nothing threatens the cosmonauts.
"Progress MS-22" docked to the ISS today, February 11, will take it out of orbit, according to the plan, February 18.

Deputy General Director of Russian Railways suggested that the Governor of the Irkutsk Region develop new sales directions
The Irkutsk Oblast needs to continue developing alternative sales destinations other than the Far East.
These are both the domestic market and ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by Deputy General Director of Russian Railways Alexei Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reports on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year showed, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "allied companies" (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal price conditions for transportation of their products under new schemes, - Alexey Shilo emphasized.
The Governor noted the importance of stable shipment of products, Irkutsk region is one of the richest in mineral resources in the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining on the territory of the region.
The instability of export shipments has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also emphasized that the Irkutsk Region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that would ensure stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk Region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do our best to provide support in terms of transportation volumes.
If there will be additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market, we are also ready to assist in this direction," said Alexei Shilo.

The cost of all works is more than 80 million rubles.
Repairs are in the final stage, there are problems with connection to the power grid - we need to increase the capacity, we are working with the power supplying organization.
In addition, in Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom were sold houses illegally connected to the electric grid by developers.
It was agreed that the grid company will organize a personal appointment next week for legal settlement of these issues.
- Very often the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electric energy for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes unauthorizedly connect houses to nearby networks, which is already grounds for disconnecting the power supply.
Therefore, now grid companies in those areas where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue," Konstantin Zaitsev emphasized.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for peasant farms in UOBO
Anatoly Prokopyev, Head of UOBO, visited three farms in the Ekhirit-Bulagatsky district today.
Yulia Madayeva, the head of a private farm in Kapsal village, received a grant for the development of her farm as a beginning farmer in 2014.
One of the main activities of the farm is the production of livestock products.
The number of livestock and gross production of meat and milk is increasing annually.
Later, thanks to the support of the state, there was an opportunity in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy cattle farm.
Today the number of cattle in the farm is about 150 heads, 60 of them are cows.
In addition, they are engaged in growing grain crops, sowing annual fodder crops.
Thanks to the activities of Victor Katanaev's farm, the Kharyashino area in the village of Kulunkun was transferred to the category of settlements.
The farm is engaged in growing and fattening of cattle of dairy direction.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a 60-head family dairy cattle farm.
To date, the farm has 150 cattle.
Also for many years potatoes have been grown here.
The head of the farm tries to create all the necessary conditions for work and living.
There is now an entire village on the farm.
Anatoly Prokopyev took personal control over the construction of two kilometers of road from Kharyashino to Ust-Ordynsky.

These funds were used to purchase a tractor trailer, two balers and a mower.
The head of the farm annually increases the number of livestock and increases gross meat production.
In addition, the farm sows annual fodder crops on the area of 40ha.
Stalina Mogzoeva plans to open a feedlot.
Following the results of the visit to three farms, the head of the district noted that the measures of state support are effective, necessary and essential.
- The Government of the Irkutsk Region pays great attention to agriculture.
Therefore, government support should not only be maintained, but also increased and enhanced.
We, in turn, must be the guarantor of food security.
Agricultural producers of the district fulfill this role with honor, - said Anatoly Prokopyev.
A crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alijan border crossing on the Turkey-Armenia border has been opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after a devastating earthquake in 1988, Turkey's Anadolu Agency noted.
Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency aid packages to the town of Adıyaman in southern Turkey on Saturday, Ankara's special envoy to Armenian-Turkish talks Serdar Kılıç said.
He expressed gratitude to Ruben Rubinian, Vice Speaker of the Armenian Parliament, and Vahan Kostanyan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia.
"I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-hit region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
In his turn, Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vahan Unanyan said that trucks with humanitarian aid have crossed the border through Margara Bridge and are on their way to the earthquake-hit region.
As Public Radio of Armenia reports, the last time a car crossed Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu Agency cites other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border crossing was last used to deliver humanitarian supplies to Armenia to deal with the aftermath of the devastating 1988 earthquake.
At that time, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to earthquake-hit areas.
More than 25,000 people have died in Turkey and Syria from Monday's devastating earthquake, according to the latest figures.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Feb. 11 that we already know from 21,848 deaths in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are marred mainly because Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial air service between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border to third-country nationals as soon as possible.

Mamaev, for all his talents, was occasionally conspicuous.
I can only wish him good luck and realize himself somewhere else," Guberniev was quoted by Metaratings.ru as saying.

A tanker with diesel from a Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed to enter a Spanish port
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine under the Spanish Ministry of Transport has banned the entry to the city's port of the Maersk Magellan vessel to unload diesel fuel, as the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which until July 1, 2022 sailed under the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport said.
"The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has banned the Singapore-flagged Maersk Magellan from entering the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel because the cargo it is carrying originates from the Cameroonian-flagged vessel Nobel, which was flying the Russian flag until July 1, 2022," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with European Union law, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag since April 16, 2022, or that changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry specified that the inspection was conducted on February 9, after which the ban was agreed upon.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships are banned from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, a Maltese-flagged Black Star vessel carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel was denied access at the port of Barcelona.
In 2022, following the intensification of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, the US and the UK imposed restrictions on supplies of Russian oil products and then decided to cap fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, the price ceiling imposed by unfriendly countries on sea oil supplies from the Russian Federation has been in effect.
At that time a ceiling on Russian oil was set at $60/bbl.
Also, an EU embargo on Russian oil shipments by sea has been in effect since December 5.
Pregnant Russian women having problems with entry to Argentina explained
According to the expert's assessment, against the background of the influx of those wishing to give birth in Argentina, the country's authorities have become more attentive to the entry of foreign citizens into its territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves and then leave.
This is reported by "Lenta.ru" with reference to Professor Viktor Heifets of St. Petersburg State University, editor-in-chief of the journal "Latin America".
No country supports such a practice, he said.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of the country becoming a transshipment point rather than a terminus.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practices.
As the expert explained, the child would still have Argentine citizenship, but it would be up to the court to decide whether to grant an Argentine passport to the parents after the residence permit was granted.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and left immediately, citizenship may be denied.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by "right of soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens the door to visa-free travel to 170 countries, including EU states and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke residence permits of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires has an interest in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the motives for the trip.

Citizens' interest in fitness services is recovering in Russia, which allows market players to expand their business.
More than 400 new facilities, mostly small-format, may open in the country this year.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data is cited by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
Olga Kiseleva, President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, said in a conversation with the publication that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, while the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFU President Elena Silina noted that there have been more club closures than openings every year since 2020.
Over the past three years, their numbers have decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts cite other figures.
According to "Contour.Focus", over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main type of activity "fitness center operation" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but as early as 2021, it began to recover.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a million inhabitants.
Russians have begun to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
Through January 2023, attendance is up 9.3 percent year-over-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis indicators by the end of the year.
A license was taken away from a management company in Kirov
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov region annulled the license for the entrepreneurial activity of managing apartment buildings issued to the management company Zabota.
In the Kirov region, the regional Arbitration Court has annulled the license for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but it only came into legal force in February 2023.
Arbitration deprived the "management company" of its license for the fact that the organization had ignored the instructions of the State Housing Inspection several times.
Currently, all facilities that were managed by Zabota have been excluded from the register of licenses to carry out entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All of the homes are in the regional center.
The Kirov administration is aware of the fact that they were left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the Mayor's Office about the situation.
Recall, in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region Alexander Sokolov set a task before the staff of the State Housing Inspection to eliminate 2/3 of management companies in the region until spring, because there are too many of them.
The legitimacy of the governor's demands has raised doubts among the Kirov Communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the Federal Antimonopoly Service could take the same position.
The antimonopoly authorities also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.

As it follows, the company has the right to debit money from remote cards without notifying the client, if payment from other cards fails for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, said that payments with customers are made with the permission of customers, and no leakage of bank card data can occur.

Came in with my daughter to draw a pension.
I was received cordially, everything was clearly explained, documents were scanned, the application was filled out, they told me how to make an appointment for further appointments.
At the entrance, the receptionist and security are greeted in a cultured, respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, but a cooler with water would not hurt to get more.
Have come 2 times, everything is great!
To all employees I wish peace, kindness, good luck and a decent salary, in this difficult time for all!!!!
It's just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine waiting for the scallop salad (which tastes just unparalleled!!!).
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!))))))
The nice checkout clerk asked me if I had my coffee with me or in the hall to make me a coffee, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
After a couple minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted it in ceramic, that's why it's "in the hall".
I've had it done to me.
I ask why it's in a cup and not a cup.
The girl replies that they don't have 300 ml cups.
Is that how it fits in a person's head?
Ask with yourself or in the hall, i.e. to determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or in a disposable cup.
Getting the answer is in the hall, i.e. in the cup.
Clarify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
To put the person in front of the fact that there are no cups of that volume.
Here's a paper cup, 300 ml.
Remarkably, this is the third such case in Greenbelt in my memory.
It was doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink my coffee the way I wanted. I asked for one myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Zelenaya Okolitsa Cafeteria and Zelenaya Okolitsa sides of the same coin or are the organizations unrelated?
If unrelated, an understanding emerges.
If related - why did a food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality condescend to the rhetoric of a stall at the Kazan railway station?
Rhetorical because this is the third time an incident like this, I repeat, has happened to me.
I don't rule out that it's not just me.
2. Does the cashier employee have instructions?
I got the impression she was acting on instinct.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please spell out the steps for your staff to take in this case, if you are trying to get service.
We like the circus very much, we have been going there since our childhood.
Saw the numbers with Nikulin Yu himself.
And now with children, nephews, too.
I like the atmosphere at the circus, the programs too.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
From almost any point you can see the arena and the backs of the people in front of you are not in the way.
The circus is very family-oriented!
this time we went to the New Year's Eve program.
A little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would have liked a number with tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby.
But I guess there's a reason for that.
All in all a very nice place!!!
I wish you prosperity and make us happy with your numbers!!!
I liked the builder, Divisionstroy, chooses good places to build residential complexes.
They use quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before the purchase, we were invited to see the complex when the walls were not even there yet, so that we could see everything in person, although how many apartments we were considering and no developer offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The most buzz is the gentle non-dense forests eh, especially when there's lots of soft snow.
But the tracks are a bit boring and short for me.
The longest ones are on the sector e, there is more or less.
But overall a great atmosphere, lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun ski mood is guaranteed!
Great master Peri!
Did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a checkroom and water.
Disgusting service.
This is the second time I've come to pick up my order by the ready time listed on the app and waited at the window sill for over 30 minutes for my order.
This kind of service is unacceptable in business today!
The response from the 'care' service is that we are trying.
At the checkout even without apology, just - it's not our fault, it's the program.
No call to alert, no other technical means of communicating with regular previously loyal customers you could find.
"Trying" is impotent, and business has to work.
Thank you, everybody, we're all going to go.
We will not order from you again and recommend you even more so.
A spoiled mood, waiting for guests, and apologizing to the hostess is not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered a vehicle (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
I expected to get the car in 3-3,5 months (as it was agreed), but the fact came out 4,5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania and Belarus (Lithuania performed).
As a result I am very satisfied with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
We rented a cabin for 4 nights for 3 people.
The cabins are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the cabin has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge available.
From the disadvantages can be distinguished except that the space is too small, the bathroom has a terribly small shower.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry things, so we had to take a drying rack from the owners and cram it in instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
But all in all not a bad option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the selection of dishes is sufficient for any guest's need.
Prices are reasonable.
There are wines and beers for those who wish to drink.
Center of Moscow, recommended
Wonderful place with very courteous staff, will definitely come again.
On-site amenities include parking and billiards.
Rooms with good repair and all amenities.
Beautiful and aesthetically pleasing place, walked around during a visit to Kaliningrad.
Loved it, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov park and landscape.
In winter there are many natural slides for children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah store)
We constantly buy here, the prices are low and the quality is at the level!
Very responsive staff, prompts and answers all questions)
I recommend this store to everyone to visit! ❤️
The location is as convenient as whoever wants it.
It's fine for me personally.
The service is fast, if any of the customers are not stupid.
The appointment is convenient.
The staff is attentive, they will prompt, direct, consult even if you come not on appointment days.
It's fine in principle.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly promptly, prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought I was gonna throw the remote away, but they were so good about it.
A huge thank you to the young guys!
Ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with 2 hour delivery for March 8.
Brought in 6 hours later flowers wrapped as if stolen (barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized something was wrong.
Compared it to the picture on the website and the color was not what I ordered at all.
I decided to count and it turned out that the tulips were an even number of 20.
Support on watsapp to my outrage about the color and number of colors replied "apparently they got the color mixed up".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of chutzpah and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office about the fact that they refused to give me a check.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next.
I do not recommend anyone to get involved with this organization.
More than 10 years I go to the master Samira, for coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel Professionalism of the master Samira, she perfectly performs her work, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the wishes of the client, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I recommend this master to all my family and friends.
All her work is always done to the highest standard !!!'
Thank you so much to Master Samira 😍
Greetings was in this game club, I can say the prices are excellent, a lot of gaming computers, as well as there are drinks and food.
On the downside, some keyboards are broken buttons fly off, if you take the "normal gameplay" comps are poorly pulled :(
Therefore, the grade is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
My son goes to his group exercise class and my mom goes to the fitness box in the evening.
The administrators are super attentive, the trainers are professional.
They organize themed holidays for children, make sure the facilities are clean and exercise equipment is maintained.
It's a pleasure to walk around and exercise.
The 6 year old child is already a good kicker, strong OFP.
Recommended for kids, moms and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is a gold !!!
The work is qualitative, caring, all clarifies.
You can always talk to girls about anything!
It was the third time !
I'll never regret it!
I can finally grow my hair back after bleaching !!!!
And Vita is also studying coloristics.
So she is the one who will soon be able to combine blon with keratin !
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰
Receptionist Elena Polyanskaya is very responsive, she explained everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
Also during the repair of my vehicle provided all kinds of assistance.
And also thanks to master Valery Ushakov for attentive and professional work.
Any question was ready to be answered.
The work was carried out in a quality manner.
The only embarrassing thing was the insufficiently correct information on the regulations of the work, the regulations were more clearly explained when you came to the TO.
I would like to express my great gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
Needed a very rare, a certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve a real estate transaction, the staff very kindly met and helped to issue this certificate, although they could refuse, as it is not part of their duties.
Thank you so much!
There are some very warm-hearted people working here.
Wonderful, kind-hearted, polite staff, I have no regrets that I came to this particular hairdressing salon! 👍
Master Nahida made perfect melting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, everyone unequivocally рекомендую❤️.
Really liked it at the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Renovated for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are both cafes and restrooms for tourists.
Went on a tour, also great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - unexpectedly beautiful collection.
We have known Olya for more than 3 years and use her services regularly.
During this time have seen Olya grow in what she loves to do, constantly learning new things and expanding the space for the four-legged ones, which is only admirable and trustworthy.
We always leave our dog with peace of mind.
Daily video reports, will pick up/drop off by pet cab as needed.
And they'll also bring back clean and delicious)
it's a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for your care and attentive personalized attention to our pets 🐕💜
The restaurant Sytyyy Los is located near Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They cook delicious meals.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to make reservations in advance before visiting, especially on Fridays!
Nice well-maintained zoo.
Smaller than Moscow's, but just as interesting and convenient.
On weekdays, adult admission was 300₽, schoolchildren 170.
There were not many people, we enjoyed walking around and looking at the animals.
The anteater was impressive)
they haven't seen him in Moscow, by the way.
There are a couple of cafes on the grounds with sane prices, the restroom is clean free, also saw a phone charging station.
All in all, I recommend it 👍
The salon is top notch!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I go only to her.
I do various facial cleanings - both hardware and mechanical.
100% satisfied.
A master of his craft👍
She tells me everything in detail about the peculiarities of my skin, she picked up cosmetics for my skin type, just perfect.
I walk around happy and beautiful now!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
Great club with huge space, pool, sauna, hammam and great trainers!
From the minuses a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club like a public bath!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting at 19:00 there are a lot of people!
I put a three and that only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the counselor, if I'm not mistaken Timur, but I could be wrong.
Formed everything quickly, told all the + / -, all lucid, my son also decided to make a card, and alas consultants are busy with their business, customers are waiting, the son came to the consultant in the end, who does not care about everything, several times otzrdil6 in the meeting room, something cheerfully discussing, in the end, my son left, nothing formalized, to forgive the consultant said, well do not want, as you want, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
New office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It is a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude to customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The selection is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to lint), the staff know their range, help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim child and a child with an irregular figure and height.
Located near the subway, even a small parking lot is available.
Recommended!
Was in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I liked the service and quality of food: prices are low, portions are medium-sized, so you can get full or order again.
The only caveat is the table reservation.
When I ordered, I entered the number and everything required, then instantly a bot called to check my phone.
Nothing further.
When I got to the restaurant itself, I found out that the table was not reserved.
Lucky there were seats available and we were able to be accommodated.
And so, actually a very good restaurant with excellent value for money.
I recommend it!
Went for a cleaning this past weekend.
This is the first time I've seen such an organized staff that was as reverent as possible to many of my questions, advised me how and what was best to do for further dental treatment.
I heartily recommend, the only clinic where they do not want to cheat on money in my memory.
It's a nice shopping center.
I've got everything!
Large assortment of merchandise.
Variety of stores.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From groceries to gifts.
I'm not going back to that store.
We bought a washing machine, they said we were out of town, so we'll take it ourselves.
Manager in the hall said where to come to the warehouse, on the question "will load"? said that yes. ))
At the warehouse they brought out without a box, when asked why? They said that's how they load everything.
When I insisted, they stuck two strips of foam plex, like that's fine!
they refused to load the trailer, they said it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery))))))
When I said I would cancel the order, they said "whatever you want, we don't care". In the end, one of them did condescend to come down the ramp and help my father put the car on the trailer.
This is the first time I've experienced such boorish service.
Nice shopping center Clean neat.large selection of stores and cafes with restaurants.
There is a movie theater "Cosmik" entertainment children's center "Nevidalia".
On the ground floor is a large hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking lot convenient location.
Good supermarket for cosmetics, lingerie and home goods.
Varied assortment, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will certainly help with the choice, advise.
Everyone will find something they need.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very nice, nice place.
I advise everyone will never be wrong in the choice.The best institution in Krasnodar in which you can relax and everything will be super.
I advise you to visit)
We express our gratitude to Chasovaya Marina, who was our funeral agent.
When she came to us on call, she took care of all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us to choose everything we needed, was in touch all the time and informed us how things were going.
Thanks to her, we gave our loved one a dignified send-off.
Everything was arranged, clearly organized as we had discussed when we first met.
Marina, well aware of the condition of our loved ones, gave us advice on how it would be better and just humanly sympathized with us.
This is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Having benefited from many good reviews, I contacted RemSteerMash and was assigned a master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that he was completely free and available for services the next day.
Everything was discussed and a time was set - 2 pm.
The next day - a call in the morning from the master and the statement that he can not come, a complex request (how? and where is "completely free?") and, if he can, instead of the appointed 14.00 will come after 18.00.
We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time another master calls and says that instead of Alexander can come, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of idle waiting, all the things I had planned to do gone!
To make a long story short, a smart master Ivan came and fixed the breakdown, for which he is thankful.
So don't fall for empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening's observations fell completely short of expectations.
First there was a short lecture with obscure material, then we looked through a telescope.
It wasn't very organized, kids were climbing to watch several times, adults were crowded and couldn't let others watch.
The objects we looked at through the telescope were the size of a normal star, and you can look for free without a telescope.
The girl did not answer questions in a very accessible way, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
I'm not sure what the 600 bucks is for.
Awesome place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in town, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
To sit down, eating 2-3 dishes for two (portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 p👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, such as Macho Boracho I highly recommend trying.
Price 420 p for 0.5 liters.
And in general in the restaurant itself is very good cuisine, I do not know how others, but I really liked it, I will advise my friends to definitely go there).
Great store, been buying from them for quite some time now, since they opened.
Good quality goods.
I bought a faucet, it's been five years and it works well and is in good condition.
Therefore, when we did the repair of the global apartment, we took everything we needed here.
Great gas station!!!
Located very conveniently, there is and ustoruzhu center and the side of the region, in general convenient)!
The quality of gas is good, I have been filling up 2 times a week for over 2 years now, no problems, the price is great!!!!
Eagles on card and cash, they don't cheat on the liter.
Store, loved it!
You can choose any model, at a democratic price, and for any purpose!
Staff, always willing to help with choices.
I took the laptop to my daughter, for study, because her laptop is broken.
Helped, picked up, gave warranty(month) Thank you! 👍
A sommelier works.
he helped with the wine selection because it's hard to figure out such a big menu on your own.
The experience with the sommelier is interesting, charming Vasily, there is no shortage of such in Moscow.
Had the pikeperch - magical, kudos to the chef.
The kids menu is like everywhere else: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. My kids had pizza, it's GREAT!
With truffle was appreciated by the adults, and the kids with ham and mushrooms.
My husband had the smoked ribs - they were the bomb, soft, juicy, flavorful.
The staff is nice, all smiling, friendly.
We loved it.
WB's brand new order pickup location is in a convenient location.
Work schedule, from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends and holidays.
There are fitting booths inside the PVZ.
It's a very nice place.
There are real professionals working here who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and a Wotsap chat for informative communication.
Quick issue.
It's nice to be able to look at the product and try it on right away.
It's great to be close to home.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything stated in the description is in stock .
Breakfast is included in the price, a wide choice of dishes to suit all tastes.
Convenient entrance, its own parking lot near the entrance.
A solid 5.
Wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different shows.
We went to see The Frog Princess today.
So far, of the children's shows, this is the best.
It was very interesting, lots of puppets, special effects.
Even my son, 14, went just for the company, and said it was a very good show.
Vacationed with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
Vacation was successful on "5", liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival called, clarified at what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a cab (at 23:00 the price of 850r), we got there quickly, there were no traffic jams, behind the barrier let us in without any problems.
Administration building next door, processed quickly, about 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator - it's a big plus!
2-bed room is spacious, floors and in the room and in the bathroom warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in 5 building).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a lady's table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not exactly small, even the freezer is there.
There are a lot of green plants in the 5th building.
All clean, change towels and linen at your request, but if you do not ask to change, they still change on the 4th day, good quality linen.
The territory is well-maintained, benches everywhere, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
There is a minibus to and from the beach every 30 min.
To the public transport stop 5 min.
In the dining hall are friendly guys, always wish you a good day.
Food is decent, but here who goes for what, we all perfectly satisfied, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and beatochki or etc., vegetables on the side dish every day, bakery own tasty, more than 4 drinks, coffee beans, for breakfast always bake pancakes, but only cheese and sausage is not very.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, no rain, temperature 11- 16 C°, sunny.
Loved it all, really took a vacation.
There is a desire to come again and it is in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It's a pity that the swimming pool and the training center will not be put into operation.
Thank you to the entire staff of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and quality work!
We've been going to Flight since August.
Daughter turned 4 in September.
Everything is very much to her liking exactly, the coach praises) that's the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova)!
I never knew my daughter was so flexible!
Wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to look into this promising establishment - and we did not miss out!
The prices are very affordable, and the incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in no time, not even a crust is left.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it :)
It just so happened that I ended up in Tomarovo Hospital with blood pressure and high heart rate.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover wiping window sills, furniture, doors.
The food is deetetic, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7am they bring tea and a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, pre-breakfast.
The nursing staff is empathetic, every single one of them put both intramuscular and intravenous shots!!!
While the IV is in place, they'll come in, ask how you're feeling....
I had previously had a heart ultrasound, but this was the first time (unfortunately, I don't know the doctor's name, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Klavdia Fedorovna!
She is a real professional: attentive, competent, gives a comprehensive answer to any question; she selected the dosage and medications, which normalized both blood pressure and heartbeat, which previously could not achieve after referring to other doctors.
Thank you very much to the head doctor Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the well-coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the nursing staff, orderlies and cooks too!
When visiting customer service, the impression left was good.
The receptionist met us in the lobby.
Knowledgeable and courteous professionals promptly and patiently assist customers with all questions asked.
The specialist assisted with the application and explained my issue.
For a small store, it's a pretty good selection of products.
There are semi-finished products, dairy, vegetables, household chemicals, miscellaneous sundries.
Works around the clock, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It's cool to have a place to ride down the mountains in the city.
The elevators are rope tow and on weekends of course the queue gathers 40 seconds downhill and 5-10 minutes queue.
But in general Cool, immersion in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are muddy and wet.
Contacted the service to repair my iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted Alexander directly, who explained all the intricacies of the repair and immediately outlined the price range.
Thank you for the repairs, everything was done with quality.
The craftsmen are very pleasant to talk to, they will show you everything and tell you everything.
However, while replacing parts, the camera was hit and the focus was off.
Immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was fixed in no time, everything is working properly.
This service has good technicians who are pleasant to talk to.
The prices, compared to other services, are reasonable, disposable.
If I need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Mashable, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires close, prompt and quality attention of restorers.
That's why 4 and most of those stars are given to the creators, not the maintainers
Great w/
Responsive concierges, garbage is removed, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to stops, schools and stores.
20 minutes to the subway by public transportation
Opened a nice, cozy recreation place in our neighborhood.
There are all the necessary stores.
A killer and diverse food court in terms of food.
The tables are arranged in cozy zones.
There's no crowding.
Well, we've been there, we've tried that....
The interior has nothing in common with an Italian cozy coffee shop.....
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like a dining room.
The pizza. well, anyone who hasn't tasted it will love it. I found it a little impersonal.
Didn't really like the fact that the waiter stands behind your back the whole time and your conversation partner across the table is almost always looking you in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly's, yes, delicious.
Would not come here again and would not recommend to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hairdresser I have ever had my hair cut and colored.
Very carefully and qualitatively does everything, I go to her with pleasure, I realize that everything will be done perfectly.
I only take my daughter to Lena.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We are from Nizhny, we broke down on the way, kind people from KatResurs quickly responded and helped!
Respect and prosperity to you, more such good people!
And the servis there is clean and nice!
We came to Sergei Chigrakov's concert.
Great concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely be there this year for the scheduled concerts.
Quiet place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music on weekends and holidays!
The staff is pleasant, and helpful!
There's a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
Rated the highest, love this place ❤
The park is in the center of town, very easy to get to.
The park is clean and has room for both kids and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust left.
There is also a fenced soccer field, which unfortunately is not very well maintained.
But there are still more pluses to our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that you can only buy at Crossroads.
The staff is cordial.
I didn't fall for any bad products.
Often promotions and discounts.
Glad it's close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We have been to the bar twice, we liked everything, polite staff, delicious food and most importantly - great music, DJs know their business.
The only thing is that the lead singer of the Hands Up Band disappoints for the second time.
Not only sings softly said not very well, but also reads the text of most songs from the phone, especially struck when they were songs of the group "Hands Up".
Somehow it doesn't make sense (performing at the Hands Up Bar, in the Hands Up Band).
We vacationed in early March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of my birthday we were given a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
The breakfasts are mind blowing.
There's a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant to your room, pay a 20% service charge on top.
The restaurant is slightly overpriced.
It tastes like a C-plus.
The water park was included in the price of the stay.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was the bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a bit disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance didn't even help open the door seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
It's something we need to work on to keep up the brand.
Great place to get together with friends for a sweat lodge.
Large and comfortable steam room, there is billiards, outdoor pool, karaoke.
The food is good, the drinks are fresh)
The workshop is on the level!
Have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes in a short time (2 husband and 1 wife).
It's all right.
The quality of work is top notch.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful school of basketball!
My son has been going for 5 months and he loves it, he looks forward to every training session.
Individual approach to children, interesting classes, warm and cordial atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I order online myself.
Great store location.
Plus there are always discounts and promotions, which is good too
Good AB store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for being responsive!
There is a cafeteria with a few tables.
I go often - everything suits me!
Nice pool!
I specifically about "frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalievna likes the child very much and professional!!!!
Locker rooms are clean, water is warm, hair dryers are available!
I love cupcake bakery, the service, croissants, breakfast and coffee are always top notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the cash register did not make coffee until I reminded them, they did, it is impossible to drink, it stinks and leaves an aftertaste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish and just left.
Last time my coffee had a long black colored hair in it, replaced.
Be more careful please, after all I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Chic eyebrows are this way!
Victoria is an excellent corrector, taking into account all facial proportions individually.
Correction with warm wax, which is good at removing all the fluff and your eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is matched to both hair and skin type, making the dye last a long time.
You can't do better than eyebrows!
Thank you so much for organizing my mom's move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything was very clear, fast, high quality.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is top-notch.
We have been getting our teeth treated at Novodenta for a long time.
Recently treated my 8 year old son's teeth, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues as the appointment is by appointment.
For me the tastiest shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a fan of shawarma, but when I want something harmful only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat lots of toppings.
And I don't know why, but it never leaks on me.
Often when you finish shawarma bottom do not eat because there is a lot of sauce water well in short fuuuu...., but not here.
That's why you guys are the best🙂
Good teachers.
In the dining room the food is always fresh .
Interesting lessons in the school museum, different events are held during the school year
Nice store, polite staff, not a bad range.
However, a big disadvantage is that the goods that are brought, apparently, destroyed right in the sales area.
Sometimes there is not enough space to pass between the rows, and also not very nice when the goods are right on the floor, without pallets, but this is more a remark to the organization, not to a particular store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
An austere splendor that is reverently cared for.
I got a double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the culture house.
As we waited for the start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was truly a coming out party.
Was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
Completely by accident came across this online auto parts store.
Called, gave the vincode, they said to wait)
Called back in about 10 minutes, offered several options.
Since the car is personal-working to save money did not become and asked to order a good set of clutch LUK.
Another 5 minutes later they called back and said good news for you.
If you take not the whole basket + disk + squeeze plate, and take LUK set basket + disk and separately squeeze plate LUK, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
After picking up the clutch I went to the service.
When removing the gearbox it was discovered that the flywheel is still needed and the sooner the better.
I already knew where I would turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by phone call (the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The next day the flywheel was in hand.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I am pleased that everything came quickly, that they went to a meeting.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop.
The New Year's Eve party was a success, but with nuances.
I booked a two-seat table, but they put me at a 4-seat table.
But that's okay.
It's just weird that they didn't give you a heads up.
The cuisine is a B, the fish was not good at all.
The presenter with contests made on pverpointe school level, frankly, not very.
BUT as far as the music goes, it's perfect.
The atmosphere was on point.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thank you for hosting the event
I leave my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 Chelyabinsk.
In this institution work only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OPD, maternity and postpartum wards.
But special thanks to Kotlyarova E.Y., it is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., it is a midwife in the labor ward, thank you very much for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
It's a beautiful store.
Large assortment of balloons, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, with left always with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the establishment on recommendation.
Food is amazing, no program, a little cocky waiters, but we were in a great lineup with the kids and celebrating an important event, were friendly.
There was no fiery plateau pitch, the kids waited.
For good food, it's safe to go.
