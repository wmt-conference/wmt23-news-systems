Police arrest 15 after violent protest outside UK refugee hotel
The incident comes after increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the Channel to the UK in boats. Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers turned violent near the English city of Liverpool. The Merseyside Police department said a police officer and two civilians sustained minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday night in Knowsley. The police force said some protesters threw objects and set a police van on fire. The people arrested, who ranged in age from 13 to 54, were detained "following violent disorder." Merseyside police commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were a couple of injuries amongst the police officers."
The Home Office has been using the hotel to temporarily house asylum seekers since last year, according to local media. George Howarth, who represents Knowsley in the UK Parliament, said the violence on Friday night did not reflect the community. "The people of Knowsley are not bigots and are welcoming to people escaping from some of the most dangerous places in the world in search of a place of safety," he said. "Those demonstrating against refugees at this protest tonight do not represent this community." The protest took place amid heightened tensions as growing numbers of refugees and migrants cross the Channel in small boats.
More than 45,000 people reached the UK by that route in 2022, and most applied for asylum. The system for considering asylum applications has slowed to a crawl because of political turmoil and bureaucratic delays, leaving many asylum seekers stuck in hotels or other temporary accommodations. The Channel crossings have become a political issue, with the Conservative government promising to "stop the boats" and pursuing a plan to send such asylum seekers to Rwanda. Opponents have accused the government of demonising desperate people fleeing war and poverty.
President's Cup: Candystripes defeat Rovers in season opener at Brandywell
Derry midfielder Adam Reilly closes down Lee Grace at the Brandywell
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup as they ran out 2-0 winners over Shamrock Rovers. The FAI Cup holders defeated last season's league winners at the Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy. The Hoops pushed to reduced terms in the second half but Ruaidhri Higgins' charges stood firm to win the curtain-raiser. Derry travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday. Patching's side-footed volley nudged Derry in front after 23 minutes - the midfielder opened the scoring as the Foylesider's ran out 2-1 winners over the eventual champions last February.
The Hoops went on to win the Premier Division by 13 points but Duffy soon had City further ahead with a long-range effort which managed to squirm under keeper Leon Pohls and into the net. Last season's runners-up were two goals to good at the break. Graham Burke went closest to reducing the arrears in the second period but the Candystripes were comfortable winners a week prior to their quest for national glory. City boss Ruaidhri Higgins praised his team after what he said was the "hardest week of my life" following the death of his brother Kevin. "It's a kick in the teeth and there's tough weeks ahead but we'll get on with it in his memory," said Higgins. "To beat Shamrock Rovers and deservedly so with a good performance is really pleasing."
DHS hires law firm to handle possible Alejandro Mayorkas impeachment proceedings
The Department of Homeland Security has hired an outside law firm - Debevoise & Plimpton - to assist in possible impeachment proceedings for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, as he potentially faces charges by House Republicans regarding his handling of the southern border. "The Department of Homeland Security has retained outside counsel to help ensure the Department's vital mission is not interrupted by the unprecedented, unjustified, and partisan impeachment efforts by some Members of Congress, who have already taken steps to initiate proceedings," a DHS spokesperson said in a statement Friday. "DHS will continue prioritizing its work to protect our country from terrorism, respond to natural disasters, and secure our borders while responding appropriately to the over 70 Congressional committees and subcommittees that have oversight of DHS." A DHS official tells CBS News the department has hired the firm for contracted work for the life of the congressional inquiry. Debevoise was chosen because of its expertise in impeachment and bipartisan experience in working with Congress on oversight.
The Justice Department recently advised that the contract with Debevoise qualifies as an appropriate expenditure for DHS. DHS is trying to ensure that its mission isn't undermined by partisan attacks and that proceedings against Mayorkas are being handled by people with the appropriate expertise. Mayorkas has not commented on this development, but asked about the impeachment inquiry last Thursday, he told reporters, "We will cooperate with this Congress, just as we did with the last Congress. I think that's our responsibility." He conceded that "it will take time" to comply with the House's investigation. "I will spend that time as will others and we will also not compromise the time that we spend in fulfilling our mission." A DHS senior official confirmed that Mayorkas has not yet met with his new outside counsel. Only one cabinet member has ever been impeached, Secretary of War William Belknap. In 1876, Belknap, who served in President Ulysses S. Grant's administration, was accused of accepting bribes but was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.
Four teens charged in attack of 14-year-old who died of suicide after beating video was posted online
Dad says daughter took her own life after being bullied at NJ school
Four New Jersey teenagers have been charged in connection with the attack of a 14-year-old girl who later took her own life after video of the incident was posted on social media. One juvenile is charged with aggravated assault, two juveniles are charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and one juvenile is charged with harassment, Ocean County prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer told CBS News in an email.
Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her Bayville home on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online. The video showed girls throwing a drink at the teen, then kicking and dragging her down school hallways. They pushed Adriana into red lockers lining the school hallways and one of the girls in a pink shirt punched Kuch repeatedly.
Another girl outside of the video frame laughed as she recorded the scene. Two adults came in to break up the attack, with one adult pulling the teens apart. Adriana lay hurt and bruised on the hallway floor as the adult tried to help her up.
One of the girls said, "That's what you get." "She loved life. She was the happiest kid. Everybody loved her," her father, Michael Kuch, told CBS New York on Thursday, adding that he's angry and wants everyone to see the video and what the teens did to his daughter.
Kuch said police should have been called immediately because the students, who he said his daughter had been having problems with, smashed her face with a 20-ounce bottle. "If they called the police and did an investigation, those girls would not have posted videos from school," Kuch said. He also said his daughter, who had bruises on her body, should've been taken to the hospital. "We always address every issue of bullying and on the day of the incident four students were suspended," Dr. Triantafillos Parlapanides, superintendent of schools, told CBS New York.
School officials told CBS New York that they notified the family and called Adriana's death horrible. Each teenager and their guardian was served with a copy of their complaint and were released pending future court appearances, the prosecutor told CBS News. Students at the school staged a walkout Wednesday in support of Adriana's family.

I talked to 30 health, wellness professionals about avoiding burnout
In our day-to-day lives, we're constantly looking for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs. This can be extremely difficult for those in the healthcare industry, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness professionals the same question: "How do you manage your energy and not burn out in your profession?" Their careers range from infectious disease doctors to psychologists to mindfulness teachers - and they all had great advice to give on how to stay motivated and keep the ball rolling. Despite the large differences in their roles, there were several themes within their responses that stood out as ways to prevent burnout.
Here are the top four approaches that they use.
1.Build a strong community: As someone who works with patients who have terminal illnesses, Eufrosina Young thanks her strong support system for her ability to maintain her energy. Young is a board-certified neurologist and ALS specialist at the Upstate University Hospital's department of neurology, and says they "mobilize like an army of people" there. There isn't a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but knowing that she isn't the only one putting in the hard work to develop treatments and provide better options for her patients, keeps Young going even on her hardest days. "We're not carrying the weight of the world, but being part of a world of people that are advocating for this work," she says.
2.Rest when you need to: Working two jobs as a sleep researcher and an algorithm engineer, all while taking care of a new baby, would have definitely led Raphael Vallat to burnout if he didn't rest, he says. "I feel like when I'm about to burn out, basically every task feels like a mountain that you need to climb, and feels super urgent and important," says Vallat. In those moments, "you really need to take some time off and realize that these tasks can wait." Typically, Vallat finds moments in his day where he can pause and spend time in nature to ground himself before returning to work.
3.Be passionate about what you're doing and remember your purpose: Up until spring of 2022, infectious disease specialist Céline Gounder worked 100 hours a week for seven days a week. Being on the frontlines during the pandemic ate up almost all of her time, but she avoided burnout by reminding herself about why her work is important. "I don't think work feels like work when you feel like you're having an impact," says Gounder. "If you're working crazy hours doing something that has no meaning to you, I think you really do need to step back and question what you're doing."
4.Have other joys: Across the board, each of the experts said they engage in some hobby like exercise, dancing and even playing the guitar. It's extremely important to have a life you enjoy that exceeds what you accomplish in your job, says Christina Maslach, social psychologist, retired professor of psychology at U.C. Berkeley and author of "The Burnout Challenge: Managing People's Relationships with Their Jobs." "Look at your life as a whole, and make sure there's good things about it, and make sure you have time for them."
Juvenile charged with murder in December Chicago school shooting that left 2 dead
A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police announced Friday. The suspect is charged with two counts of felony first-degree murder and two counts of felony attempted murder, Chicago Police superintendent David Brown announced. "We currently don't have a clear motive for why a 16 year old would want to shoot and kill other kids," Brown said. The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would face the murder and attempted murder charges as an adult.
Four teenagers were shot December 16 at Benito Juarez High School. The victims who died were both boys, aged 14 and 15, police announced at the time. Investigators say tips from the public helped lead them to the suspect, who was arrested Thursday. "We are grateful for those who have been brave enough to come forward to ensure that the offender is caught and will now be held accountable," said Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx. The suspect is expected to appear in Bond Court Saturday, Brown said, where more details about the evidence they have collected will be presented.
Minnesota biologists rescue trapped black bear
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a bear-y unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch. The bear had hunkered down in a culvert alongside the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department. But when the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice, according to the department. Staff from the department quickly responded to the scene and helped remove the bear. The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and pronounced him healthy but groggy - obviously, because he'd been woken up from his winter sleep," according to the Facebook post. The department then relocated the bear to a state sanctuary to resume his hibernation. The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.
The department reminded residents that moving bears is a job best left to the professionals. If you're worried about a bear in your neighborhood, you should contact local authorities - not try to move or feed the sleeping giant. In this case, bystanders first tried to dig out the bear by themselves and offered him food, including Pop-Tarts, lettuce and Fancy Feast cat food. But, luckily for the well-intentioned diggers, "because bears don't have the desire to eat in the winter, the bear didn't bite." Minnesota is home to between 12,000 and 15,000 black bears, found mainly in the northern third of the state, according to the Department of Natural Resources. The predators hibernate for as long as six or seven months in the winter, during which time they do not eat and live off of their stored body fat.
Photos: Following restorations, Egypt inaugurates the Djehuty and Hery tombs
The tombs of Djehuty and Hery have been inaugurated on Thursday following the completion of restoration work. The inauguration was conducted by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt Mostafa Waziri, Ambassador of Span to Egypt Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino. Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered through the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission from the Supreme Council of Antiquities and CSIC, working since 2002. He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research related to the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor. They succeeded in uncovering many tombs, coffins, mummies and a funerary garden.
Important tombs from an important era
Wazir explained that these two tombs belong to prominent people, who lived during the beginning of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt. He said that the layout of the tombs are T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs from the 18th dynasty. These consistent of an entrance, a column hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls featuring distinct inscriptions. Waziri added that Djehuty was supervisor of the state treasury and overviewed works of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.
Djehuty was also responsible for recording Hatshepsut's journey to Puntland, and providing electrum (a mixture of gold and silver) for covering the top of the obelisks that she placed in the Karnak temples. In addition, he was in charge of the process of moving the obelisks. The room that precedes the Djehuty's burial chamber features inscriptions engraved with 43 chapters of the Book of the Dead, the first time that the chapters of the book were written on the walls of tombs before being written on linen and papyrus. Hery, held the position of superintendent of the royal stores of the sacred royal wife and mother, Ahhotep.
Jared O'Mara should never have been a Labour candidate, says Rachel Reeves
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year jail sentence, the shadow chancellor has said. Rachel Reeves was talking to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local party quit in protest at how Labour's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
The entire selection committee in Bolton North East resigned after they were not allowed to choose the shortlist, an increasingly common practice in Keir Starmer's Labour party, saying: "Yet again, it appears that the Labour party is seeking to promote the views and attitudes of a clique in London, rather than local members in the north." They added: "This goes against the attitude necessary to win back the red wall, which is so desperately needed to deliver a Labour government." Reeves said: "I don't know what the circumstances are of what has happened in Bolton, but I do know that those being selected are strong candidates, often with very strong roots in their communities."
There has been particular unhappiness that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and aide to the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, was not longlisted to try to win the seat back from the Conservatives, despite garnering nominations from four big trade unions. Reeves said she had nothing to do with candidate selection, but added: "I do know that it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can be longlisted and who can be shortlisted."
O'Mara was imprisoned for four years this week after a jury found he had submitted fake expense claims totalling £52,000 in an attempt to fund his cocaine and alcohol abuse. Many people have suggested he was not properly vetted by Labour when he was selected to fight Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, in Sheffield Hallam in 2017"s snap general election. Asked if the O'Mara debacle was looming large in the minds of Labour's NEC, Reeves said: "I don't want to suggest in any way that anyone not on a shortlist is a cocaine user. But Jared O'Mara was a terrible case. He should never have been selected as a Labour candidate; he should never have been an MP. He used public money, it's absolutely right he's received his sentence."
The O'Mara circumstances were "pretty exceptional," said Reeves, but she acknowledged: "There are important lessons to be learned for the Labour party and all political parties on the selection of candidates. But I would also say, in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards falling well short of what you could expect." She added: ""One thing I would say about the Labour party is that when people do wrong, they lose the whip. And that's just not the case in the Conservative party."
Reeves was in Bolton to meet apprentices at a training centre for Openreach, which provides the UK's broadband network. After watching apprentices climb up pretend telegraph poles at the £1.7m site, Reeves discussed Labour's plans to overhaul the apprenticeship levy, which forces larger firms to put aside 0.5% of their payroll to fund apprentices.
Businesses complain the levy is too inflexible. For example, said Reeves, Openreach "wants to retrain people who work on copper to work on fibre, but the apprenticeship levy doesn't have that flexibility around retraining." Reeves said Labour would change the levy so companies could use the money to retrain employees in industries such as the automotive sector and those currently fitting gas boilers. "We need them as part of the energy transition to net zero to be learning the skills to work on electric vehicles or fitting heat pumps or hydrogen boilers. We want those people to be retrained to get the skills that they need to succeed. And yet the apprenticeship levy is stacked up against them. Businesses want greater flexibility and young people starting off in life or older people who want to retrain to make sure that their skills are relevant for the future," said Reeves.
One arrested amid Tate Britain protest over drag queen children's event
One person has been arrested amid a protest outside Tate Britain, where a drag queen storytelling event for children was being hosted. The Metropolitan police said one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment towards a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster. No injuries have been reported and officers remain at the scene, the force said.
The Tate was hosting Drag Queen Story Hour UK on Saturday, with tales told by Aida H Dee, who the gallery's website describes as "the first drag artist in Europe to read stories to children in a nursery." A rightwing group of protesters demonstrated outside the gallery and were met by counterprotesters led by trans-rights campaigners and political groups, including Stand Up to Racism. Officers had to form a corridor so attenders could get into the venue.
Writing on Twitter, the drag queen said the day had been "proper emotional," adding that five protesters had gained entry to the Tate and "caused a disruption" in parts of the building, but they did not affect the readings. She had previously told Pink News that the invite to the Tate for the event during LGBTQ+ history month had been "an honour." Her readings have previously been targeted by protesters. The Drag Queen had said that "risk assessments" had taken place beforehand - but added it was "ridiculous" that they were necessary. Aida tweeted: "5 haters made it into the Tate. They caused a disruption. BUT not to Drag Story Hour UK ...They made a fuss elsewhere in the building, not where the show was!! SHOW 2 went swimmingly!!!" Aida had been staging three storytelling sessions on Saturday at 11am, noon and 2pm. A spokesperson for the Tate said: "We do not programme artists in order to promote particular points of view, nor to reconcile differing points of view." Our galleries offer a broad programme and visitors have the freedom to choose which aspects of it they engage with."
Trump's Prized 40 Wall Street Building On 'Lender Watch' Amid Dropping Income: Report
Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is on "lender watch" amid plummeting income and increasing costs, Bloomberg reported Friday. The vacancy rate at the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to almost 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported. Expenses, meanwhile, have reportedly risen 11% since the origin of the 2015 mortgage. Trump has often bragged about the building he acquired in 1995, which was appraised at $540 million in 2015.
The day of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, a Trump bragged in a TV interview that 40 Wall Street was suddenly the tallest building in the city. Not only was his claim insensitive, it was also a lie.
Another nearby skyscraper on Pine Street in Lower Manhattan became the tallest building after the destruction of the Twin Towers. High-rise office leasing in Manhattan has been dropping for years, which was exacerbated after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as many companies shut down and employees of surviving firms worked remotely. Wells Fargo, which is servicing the mortgage on 40 Wall Street, "has reached out to the borrower for a status of leasing developments" and the plans to improve the property's performance, according to the filing, Bloomberg reported.
Wagner owner says war in Ukraine will drag on for years
The owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine has predicted that the war could drag on for years. Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas. He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.
The statement from Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed "Putin's chef" for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, marked a recognition of the difficulties that the Kremlin has faced in the campaign, which it initially expected to wrap up within weeks when Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south. The Kremlin has avoided making forecasts on how long the fighting could continue, saying that what it called the "special military operation" will continue until its goals are fulfilled. The Russian forces have focused on Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the Donbas region where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
Prigozhin said that the Wagner Group mercenaries were continuing fierce battles for control of the Ukrainian stronghold of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region. He acknowledged that the Ukrainian troops were mounting fierce resistance. As Russian troops have pushed their attacks in the Donbas, Moscow has also sought to demoralize Ukrainians by leaving them without heat and water in the bitter winter.
On Friday, Russia launched the 14th round of massive strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other vital infrastructure. High-voltage infrastructure facilities were hit in the eastern, western and southern regions, resulting in power outages in some areas. Ukraine's energy company, Ukrenergo, said Saturday that the situation was "difficult but controllable," adding that involved backups to keep up power supplies but noting that power rationing will continue in some areas. Ukraine's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said that Russian forces launched 71 cruise missiles, 35 S-300 missiles and seven Shahed drones between late Thursday and midday Friday, adding that Ukrainian air defenses downed 61 cruise missiles and five drones.
The Ukrainian authorities reported more attacks by killer drones later on Friday. The Ukrainian air force said the military downed 20 Shahed drones in the evening. Late Friday, Russian military bloggers and some Ukrainian news outlets posted a video showing an attack by a sea drone on a strategic railway bridge in the Odesa region. The grainy video showed a fast-moving object approaching the bridge in Zatoka, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Odesa, and exploding in a powerful blast. The authenticity of the video couldn't be verified. The Ukrainian military hasn't commented on the attack, and Serhii Bratchuk, a spokesman for the regional administration, wouldn't confirm the drone attack when he spoke in televised remarks on Saturday. The bridge, which was targeted by Russian missile strikes early in the war, serves the railway link to Romania, which is a key conduit for Western arms supplies.

ASTANA.KAZINFORM - Opening ceremony of the 10th Asian Athletics Indoor Championships took place on Friday at Qazaqstan sports center in Astana. Attending the event was Kazakh Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov, Kazinform cites the press service of the Kazakh Prime Minister. Opening the event, the Head of the Kazakh government read out the welcome letter of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. "Sport knows no bounds. It strengthens friendship and brings together nations and countries. Special attention is attached to sports in Kazakhstan. There are all conditions for doing professional and mass sports in our country.
Great attention is placed on the development of sports infrastructure. Clear evidence of that is this athletics complex seating over six thousand people," reads the Kazakh President's letter. Kazakhstani athletes successfully compete and represent Kazakhstan at major world competitions. They are an example to the growing generation and inspire the youth for great victories, Tokayev noted. He expressed confidence that the holding of the Asian Championships in Astana will give a new impetus to the development of athletics in the country, pledging for greater cooperation with international organizations in the sphere.
Kazakh Prime minister Smailov expressed special gratitude to the President of the Asian Athletics Association Dahlan al-Hamad for his assistance in preparing for and holding the championships. The Asian Athletics Indoor Championships take place for the first time in the CIS territory. The tournament brought together over 500 athletes from 31 countries who are to compete in race, relay race, long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, and all-around event. The tournament is to run through February 12. Earlier it was reported Kazakhstani runner Caroline Chepkoech Kipkirui won the women's 3,000m gold, and Olga Safronova claimed the women's 60m silver at the tournament.
Yellowstone' actor Q'orianka Kilcher beats fraud charges
Attorney Camille Vasquez, who represented Johnny Depp in last year's blockbuster defamation trial, has scored another legal victory - this time with "Yellowstone" actor Q'orianka Kilcher. On Friday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office cleared Kilcher, 32, of all charges in a workers" compensation fraud case. In a statement shared Friday with The Times, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County district attorney said the court "determined that Ms. Kilcher did not commit insurance fraud and advised the court that we were unable to proceed."
In July 2022, California officials charged Kilcher with two felony counts of workers" compensation fraud, accusing her of illegally collecting more than $96,000 in disability benefits between October 2019 and September 2021. The time frame also includes several months when Kilcher worked on "Yellowstone," despite the actor's claims that she was too injured to work. Kilcher self-surrendered and was arraigned in May.
"Today, I am beyond grateful that my case has been dismissed - tomorrow my journey begins to help raise awareness and demand more transparency for worker's rights within the workers comp system" Kilcher said Friday in a statement shared with The Times. She added that she "look[s] forward to shedding more light on this experience and continuing to do the work I love." Kilcher also thanked Vasquez and her fellow Brown Rudnick attorney Steve Cook for "their steadfast belief in my innocence."
According to TMZ, Kilcher hired the two in September. Kilcher broke out with Terrence Malick's 2002 movie "The New World," where she portrayed Pocahontas. Her credits also include "Sons of Anarchy," "The Alienist" and "Dora and the Lost City of Gold." She most recently appeared in the road-trip film "Dog," starring Channing Tatum.
Balenciaga boss calls holiday campaign 'stupid mistake'
Luxury clothing brand Balenciaga is still reeling from the backlash over two of its recent ad campaigns. Months after the fashion house came under heat for promotional images that critics said sexualized children, Balenciaga artistic director Demna (full name Demna Gvasalia) said he's still sorry for the images in an interview with Vogue published Friday. "I want to personally apologize for the wrong artistic choice of concept for the gifting campaign with the kids and I take my responsibility," he told Vogue, echoing a previous statement he posted to social media in December.
In November, the brand shared photos for its "The Gift" collection, which featured child models posing with teddy bears that were dressed in bondage attire. Shortly after, Balenciaga dropped photos for its spring 2023 campaign that featured a page from a 2008 Supreme Court case involving "virtual child pornography" in the background. Parents, including reality TV star and longtime Balenciaga fan - and brand partner - Kim Kardashian, spoke out against the brand and its "disturbing images" on social media. Days later, Balenciaga released a statement apologizing for the photos and outlining the changes it would implement to avoid similar "mistakes" in the future. "This experience has forced me to reevaluate a lot of things in the way I, we, work, in the way we create and communicate images, the way we interact with our audiences, and the way we learn from our mistakes and move forward," Demna told Vogue.
He detailed the postbacklash changes at Balenciaga: "restructuring the image department," conducting more internal and external checks for campaign imagery, and partnering with the National Children's Alliance to help "thousands of kids in the process of overcoming trauma and dealing with their mental health." "It's the one thing that makes me happy about this whole horrible situation: to do something good out of it," he said of that partnership, which was announced Wednesday.
Also teaming up with the NCA is Balenciaga's parent company, Kering, which oversees other luxury brands including Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta. Under the Kering umbrella is Gucci, which faced backlash in December for a campaign featuring Harry Styles that some social media critics alleged also sexualized children. In the interview, Denma said he plans to move away from the brand's "provocative" ways. "This is part of my learning: I will have a more mature and serious approach to everything I release as an idea or an image," he said. "I have decided to go back to my roots in fashion as well as to the roots of Balenciaga, which is making quality clothes - not making image or buzz."
Speaking of the brand's origins, elsewhere in the interview Demna said one of the most "painful" parts of the backlash was tarnishing "the name of Balenciaga and the legacy of Cristóbal Balenciaga." "Balenciaga is a house that is over one century old and is based on strong and beautiful creative values, and I have been busy doing all in my creative power to bring it to its modern relevance, and suddenly we were under attack and labeled as something we're not at all," Demna said. "We certainly made a huge and stupid mistake with the gifting campaign, and we certainly have learned from it."
It's Fake News, CBN Debunks Claim It Lacks Capacity To Print More New Naira Notes
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has described as misleading, the report that claimed to be quoting CBN govemor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, as attributing the current challenge in the distribution of the newly redesigned Naira banknotes to a shortage of printing materials at the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company Plc. In a statement issued on Saturday, CBN spokesman, Osita Nwasinobi, said at no time did the CBN governor made such statement during his presentation to the National Council of State at its meeting on Friday, February 10, 2023. Mr Nwasinobi said Emefiele only told the meeting that the NSPMC was working on printing all denominations of the Naira to meet the transaction needs of Nigerians. He said while the CBN appreciates the concerns shown by all stakeholders about the distribution of the new Naira notes, "we are alarmed at the extent to which vested interests are attempting to manipulate facts and pitch the public against the Bank." Nwasinobi said the CBN remains committed to performing its monetary policy functions, as stipulated in the CBN Act, 2007 (as amended). "We also wish to restate that the NSPMC has the capacity and enough materials to produce the required indent of the Naira. "The bank, therefore, wishes to appeal to the public to disregard the said report and exercise more restraint, even as we work assiduously to increase the circulation of the new notes in the country," he added.
On a particular voice note trending on the social media alleging that the CBN planned to shut down some banks, particularly in a particular geopolitical region of the country, the CBN said there was no such plan and that the claims were illogical and do not comply with the workings of the Nigerian banking system. "The public is therefore advised to ignore such recordings as they do not represent the policy thrust of the CBN and are only the desperate attempts of persons bent on inciting the public against the Bank," he stated.
Tim Sherwood tears into £44m signing Pedro Porro after dismal Tottenham debut
Porro had an afternoon to forget against Leicester (Picture: Getty)
Tim Sherwood tore into Pedro Porro's "absolutely disgusting" defending during Tottenham's 4-1 defeat to Leicester City. Spurs signed the right-back from Sporting CP on transfer deadline day on an initial loan deal for £5million with the obligation to buy this summer for £39million. The 23-year-old was handed his debut by Antonio Conte on Saturday at the King Power Stadium with his side taking the lead after 14 minutes through Rodrigo Bentancur.
But it turned into an miserable afternoon with Nampalys Mendy, James Maddison and Kelechi Iheanacho all scoring to give Leicester a 3-1 at half-time with Porro enduring a torrid first-half in the Premier League. The Spaniard was at fault again as Leicester thought they had added a fourth through Barnes and while the goal was ruled out for offside, former Spurs manager Sherwood was left shocked by the full-back's defensive efforts. "I don't want to keep picking on the kid but he needs to be relieved of his duties," Sherwood told Soccer Saturday. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because it is his debut but Pedro Porro is no bad it is unbelievable. His positioning is absolutely disgusting, Barnes and Maddison are destroying him down the left hand side. Daniel Levy was saying this week, they have spent a lot of money, yes they have, but their recruitment has been very poor and this is the latest addition. Let's not make any conclusions at the moment but what I am looking at is a player who does not want to defend.
"Antonio Conte has complained about the defending and this player, at the moment is struggling to defend. He is up against very good players in Barnes and Maddison but it is very disappointing." While the goal was ruled out, Leicester restored their 4-1 lead with Barnes on target nine minutes from full-time. Despite beating Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move ahead of Newcastle into third place.
Jack Smith should win any privilege fight over Mike Pence subpoena
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to muck up this latest development in the Justice Department's probe? The short answer is that any attempt to scuttle the Pence subpoena on executive privilege grounds should fail. First off, there's a threshold question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege. Recall that Trump tried and failed to block the House Jan. 6 committee from getting White House records.
The Supreme Court declined to take up Trump's appeal last year, with only Justice Clarence Thomas (husband of 2020 election denier Ginni Thomas) dissenting. But the court left open the question of whether an ex-president can claim privilege, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting he'd support such a claim. So it's at least unclear whether a former president can claim the privilege, saying nothing of whether the claim would succeed. Plus, the Supreme Court appeal over then-President Richard Nixon's attempt to avoid subpoena compliance shows that a vague privilege assertion won't do, and can be overcome by a specific need for evidence.
The court observed in 1974"s United States v. Nixon: ... when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial. Therefore, precedent is on the government's side. Of course, however, delays from litigating even a losing issue can be a victory of sorts for Trump. But further dampening the odds of a successful privilege claim is the previous rejection of Trump's attempt to block Jan. 6 grand jury testimony.
As The Washington Post reported in October, that rejection noted that former Pence aide Marc Short, for example, "probably possessed information important to the Justice Department's criminal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol that was not available from other sources." That Pence, too, likely has unique information would help the DOJ in any subpoena fight. And the reason we think Pence has such information is yet another reason that a privilege claim should fail. That's because Pence has chosen to write publicly about at least some of his supposed conversations with Trump in connection with Jan. 6. It's hard to say communications are privileged when you've previously deemed them fit to publicize. So while the subpoena might present varying political and personal calculations for Pence - who may vie for the 2024 Republican nomination against Trump, someone who effectively condoned calls for Pence's extrajudicial execution on Jan. 6 - the courts should have an easy time siding with DOJ on privilege.
The Case Against a Biden Run Is Obvious - and Weak
Why is this important? While Biden and his fellow Democrats can't do much in the way of passing laws with the GOP in control of the House, they can still spend the next two years setting an example. Collectively, everyone on the team should be seeking out opportunities to play Gallant to the Republicans" weird Goofus impulses. But it's also important for Biden to burnish his credibility with the American people - and maybe be a direly needed change agent in our all-too-tatty political culture.
Washington, a notoriously cynical place, is famous for its common sense-crippling ideas about leadership. Perhaps one of the most notorious is the odd standard that holds that publicly admitting errors is a sign of weakness and that politicians should go to comical lengths to avoid doing so. There's another way: In Bailout, Neil Barofsky's memoir of his time in Washington serving as the special inspector general overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, he described the advice he received from Kristine Belisle, the woman he smartly hired to be his communications director. It was about as anti-Washington as it can get: "We'll admit and even highlight our mistakes."
As she went on to explain, there's method in a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would deem madness: This is the best way to earn the press's trust. They'll know we're not spinning like everyone else. SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source for information in Washington about TARP. We might be embarrassed at times and disclose things that we could - and others would - easily hide, but we'll shock the press with our honesty. No one else does this, and before long, we'll have a built in defense when we're attacked. No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us, because we'll prove to them that we tell the truth. This is perhaps the biggest reason for Biden to pursue the course of radical responsibility-taking: Moments inevitably arise in any presidency when having the trust of the public and the institutions that safeguard the civic interest is critical. Moreover, there is vital capital to be earned by owning our mistakes, and there's an important distinction that Biden can draw with his political opponents. The president would do well to follow the old adage: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Some Super Bowl Commercials I Can't Wait to See
A nineties sitcom star reprising his beloved role to sell you car insurance. An ad that becomes a cultural phenomenon and gets immediately green-lighted as a TV show, extending a twelve-second scene into ten seasons. All the celebrities from last year's crypto ads apologizing for their crypto ads. Those "whassup" guys but the bit is that now they're old. Everybody's into whodunnits now, right? So some series of ads directed by Rian Johnson where if you figure out who did the murder you get a discount on a year of car insurance. A commercial that all of the super-online conservative guys are going to be furious about for a week.
Timothée Chalamet in some capacity. Somebody who was supposedly cancelled forever making his triumphant return to television to sell you beer. An ad for the worst movie you'll ever see that you'll definitely watch when it's streaming in three weeks. An excruciatingly catchy new jingle that you'll be singing to yourself for years. A recycled Twitter joke from two months ago. A musician whose whole thing is being counterculture who is counterculturally telling you to bank with Wells Fargo. The "zoom zoom" kid but the bit is that now he's an adult.
Biden DOJ 'Doesn't Want an Armed Citizenry'
Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) sat down with Breitbart News on Thursday and discussed his plans to block the ATF pistol brace rule and his conviction that the Biden Department of Justice "doesn't want an armed citizenry" in the first place. Clyde made clear his opposition to the pistol brace rule. His reasons for that opposition include both general objections and more specific ones. Generally, he expressed his conviction that our Founding Fathers did not set forth a plan of governance that included federal agencies making laws in place of the legislature. He said, "The Justice Department is there to enforce the law, not to make the law. When you have the executive branch making the law and enforcing the law, then you have have a king, and a kingdom. Our Founders did not call for a king and they did not lay out a kingdom in the Constitution of the United States." Clyde then moved to specifics regarding the pistol brace rule and expressed his concern that the rule is part of a greater ATF push to acquire broader registration of firearms. He noted, "What the ATF wants is they want to increase the registration database for the National Firearms Act. They want to register people across the country because, as we know, what comes before confiscation is registration. And confiscation, in my opinion, is the ultimate goal, because this Justice Department doesn't want an armed citizenry." He added, "But this Justice Department wants a registered citizenry, so they know who's got what, so they can come after us."
Clyde's contention is that the ATF pistol brace rule was born in this environment of hostility toward the Second Amendment and toward private gun ownership, and he plans to fight it tooth and nail. He said he has "three tools" with which to fight the rule. The first of those tools is the SHORT Act and the second is the Congressional Review Act.
On January 30 Breitbart News quoted Clyde outlining his plan to "reintroduce the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act, or the SHORT Act, to repeal elements of the National Firearms Act, thereby prohibiting the ATF from registering and banning pistols with stabilizing braces." He also noted that he would "introduce a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, to override the Biden administration's unlawful overreach." Both acts, the SHORT Act and the Congressional Review Act, have the possibility of blocking the ATF pistol brace rule. But as Clyde told Breitbart News Thursday, the great challenge is that both of those routes will ultimately require President Biden's signature, either to enact the SHORT Act legislation or to finalize a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act.
He made clear that getting Biden's signature is not an impossibility, as there are ways; for instance, the SHORT Act legislation could be added to other, larger bills that Democrats are very anxious to pass. However, Clyde indicated there is also a third way to block the ATF pistol brace rule. He said: "I'm on the Appropriations Committee and we can defund this pistol brace rule, through what is called a limitation amendment. We can literally defund this rule and basically say, "No money may be spent executing or enforcing this particular pistol brace rule." And we can also do the very same thing with the ATF receiver/frame rule, from last August. I think both of them need to be defunded and I look forward to working with our appropriators to do it.
We Hope' Biden Has a Plan for Handling Title 42 Ending, 'If They Do, They Haven't Shared It Fully'
On Friday's edition of NBC's "MTP Now," Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said that he has "a lot of concern" over what will happen when Title 42 ends in May, he hopes the Biden administration has a plan for when the policy ends, and that "If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet." And said that "we've said, you need a plan. We want them to vet it with us."
Polis stated that he wishes that more time was spent on the issue of immigration during the meeting of governors at the White House, but the issue "came up." We did have Secretary Mayorkas there for part of it. And so, we brought up, again, there's a lot of concern I share about what will happen when Title 42 ends in May and so, making sure that the federal government has a plan. We hope they do. If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet. But we've said, you need a plan. We want them to vet it with us. We want to make sure it's not what we experienced in December times five or times three, that would be a disaster for the country and it would be terrible for the Biden administration.
McDonald's withdraws "tasteless" advert near crematorium - RT World News
McDonald's has apologized after an advertisement for the fast-food chain's "McCrispy" burger was placed close to a crematorium in the UK - although some locals did see the funny side. The restaurant chain has pledged to remove the offending advertising hoarding following complaints from residents of Truro in the UK county of Cornwall. It had gained attention on social media on Friday for being placed on a busy road directly opposite an establishment which offers cremation services. The brightly lit advert, which was placed directly behind a sign pointing to the crematorium, was branded as "tasteless" by some angry locals. "Although I can see the funny side, it is tasteless and I'm sure some grieving family members won't like to see it when visiting Penmount for the funeral and cremation of a loved one," said a resident whose mother-in-law was cremated at the funeral home last year, as quoted by British media.
However, not everyone was quite so offended by the unfortunate placement of the advertisement, with one noting that a person's reaction to it would likely be influenced by "how long ago you followed the crematorium sign wearing a black tie." One person said they "fell off the chair laughing" when they spotted the advert online, while it was also noted by another local that it was "no worse" than the council's decision to entertain the idea of allowing a crematorium to be built "next door to a retirement village."
A statement issued by McDonald's was published by local media on Friday soon after an image of the advertisement went viral online, in which the restaurant chain said it would remove the advert as soon as possible. "We were unaware of the road sign in the vicinity of this bus stop. However, in light of the concerns raised by CornwallLive, we have asked for our advertisement to be removed," the fast-food brand said. Cornwall Council, which operates both the crematorium and the bus shelter which displays the advert, declined the comment on the furor when contacted by local media.
Gut instinct' missing woman is not in river
Searches for missing English woman Nicola Bulley have entered a 16th day after her partner said his "gut instinct" is that she is not in the river. Lancashire Police said officers are keeping an "open mind" while continuing to appeal for information about Ms Bulley, who disappeared on 27 January while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre. The force is continuing to search the River Wyre towards the sea at Morecambe Bay, working on one hypothesis that the 45-year-old, from Inskip, could have fallen in. Their search has been aided by specialists and divers from HM Coastguard, mountain rescue, and Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, with sniffer dogs, drones, and police helicopters deployed.
Ms Bulley vanished while walking her springer spaniel Willow near the river, shortly after dropping her daughters, aged six and nine, at school. The mortgage adviser's phone was found on a bench overlooking the river, still connected to a work call. Her partner, Paul Ansell said he wants to keep "all options open" about her disappearance, but his "gut instinct" tells him she is not in the river. He described Ms Bulley as "fun," "loving," "the most loyal friend you could ever have" and an "exceptional mum" who "absolutely adores our girls." "She's just a pillar of strength to our family and without her, the hole is bigger than you can possibly imagine," he told 5 News.
Mr Ansell said that although the family is going through "unprecedented hell," hope that his partner will be found is "stronger than ever." Police have discounted foul play and are treating the incident as a missing person inquiry. On Thursday, the focus of their search switched from St Michael's to around 10 miles downstream where the river empties into the sea at Morecambe Bay, with patrol and rescue boats spotted in the area.
East Germany's last communist leader dies at 95
BERLIN (AP) - Hans Modrow, who served as East Germany's last communist leader during a turbulent tenure that ended in the country's first and only free election, has died. He was 95. Modrow died early Saturday, the Left party parliamentary group tweeted.
Modrow, a reform-minded communist, took over East Germany shortly after the Berlin Wall fell and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the gathering momentum for German reunification. "The entire peaceful course of establishing German unity was precisely a special achievement of his," the Left wrote on Twitter."That will remain his political legacy." During 16 years as communist party chief in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure. He rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.
A post in East Germany's top leadership eluded him until he was made prime minister, a position that previously carried little clout, in November 1989 - days after the fall of the Berlin Wall. When hard-line leader Egon Krenz and his ruling Politburo resigned in early December, Modrow emerged as East Germany's top political figure. But the communists could no longer call the shots on their own. The following month, he agreed to share power with the increasingly vocal opposition and moved up East Germany's landmark first free election to March 1990, amid growing unrest. Even as pro-democracy rallies rapidly took on a pro-unification flavor, the communists initially had opposed talk of reunification.
In February 1990, however, Modrow urged talks with West Germany toward an eventual "united fatherland" that would be independent of military blocs and governed by a joint parliament in Berlin. Modrow headed the election campaign of the restyled communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, but his personal popularity was not enough to prevent them finishing as only the third-strongest party, with 16 percent support. The winner was an alliance of conservative parties that favored quick reunification and was backed by the government of West German leader Helmut Kohl.
Germany reunited under Kohl's leadership and as a NATO member on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Modrow became a member of the united parliament, where he sat until 1994, and honorary chairman of the post-communist PDS - the predecessor of today's opposition Left party. From 1999 to 2004, he was a member of the European Parliament. Modrow's past under hard-line communist rule landed him in court several years after reunification.
In 1995, a court convicted him of inciting the falsification of results in May 1989 local elections in Dresden. It handed him a nine-month suspended sentence and a fine. Modrow claimed that the trial was politically motivated and asserted that its outcome would aggravate divisions between east and west Germans. His attorney argued that he had made amends for previous injustices by overseeing free elections as prime minister.
Later in life, Modrow served on the council of elders of the Left party. "Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left party parliamentary group. "Until old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
Indian govt withdraws appeal to hug cows on Valentine's Day after criticism
Hugging a cow on Valentine's Day is no longer being encouraged by the Indian government - despite it previously asking people to do so to promote Hindu values. The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) retracted its "Cow Hug Day" appeal after it attracted criticism from political rivals and social media users. The Indian government department had called on citizens to deviate from Western romantic gestures celebrated on Valentine's Day.
Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, said the call to hug cows had been "absolutely crazy, defying logic." He added that the decision to withdraw the appeal was more "to prevent the politics of Hindutva [Hindu nationalism] from being ridiculed in the face of severe criticism from all quarters." The AWBI reneged on its appeal on Friday saying it "stands withdrawn." It was only on Wednesday when its statement read that "hugging cows [would] bring emotional richness and increase individual and collective happiness."
It added that the cow is the "backbone of Indian culture and rural economy... because of its nourishing nature like [a] mother." There were mixed reactions to the initial announcement as some posted videos of cows rejecting being hugged and charging off. Others wanted to clarify that the appeal was more for following one's own culture, as opposed to "blindly" following Western values.
Young Indians typically spend Valentine's Day crowding parks and restaurants, exchanging gifts and holding parties. Cow cuddling is nothing new either - with it being considered therapeutic in parts of the world, and in The Netherlands where it is known as "koe knuffelen." Devout Hindus worship the cow - known as gau mata, or "mother cow" - and most states in India have banned cow slaughter.
In recent years, certain Hindu hard-liners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day goes against traditional values and promotes promiscuity. Hindu nationalist groups such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have said such raids help reassert a Hindu identity. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda, seeking the religion's supremacy in a secular nation known for its diversity. While Hindus comprise almost 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for most of the rest.
Pedestrian dies in hospital after crash with car in Cowdenbeath as man arrested
A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife. The 38-year-old female was rushed to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy following the crash on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath on Friday around 1.30pm. A 24-year-old man has subsequently been arrested in connection with the crash. Police are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dash-cam footage to come forward. Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and who witnessed the crash to get in touch." I would also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area and who may have dash-cam footage which could assist our investigation to contact us. "Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."
IN NUMBERS: The Oslo boroughs where the most foreigners live
Roughly 177,000 of Oslo's 634,000's residents have immigrated to Norway from other countries. When you include those born in Oslo to foreign parents, the proportion of those who are immigrants or have an immigrant background rises to more than a third. In Oslo, citizens from Asia, including Turkey, made up the largest immigrant group, with over 62,985 of these nationals living in the city, according to figures from the national data agency Statistics Norway (SSB). After that, citizens from the EU, EEA and the UK made up the second largest group, accounting for not far off 10 percent of the city's population.
Africans made up the third largest group of immigrants in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo. Europeans from countries that aren't part of the UK, EU or EEA were the fourth largest group, accounting for 15,566 Oslo residents. From here, the size of the groups drops significantly. For example, there were just shy of 7,000 citizens from South American countries in 2022, while there was a smidge over 3,000 nationals hailing from North and Central America. Meanwhile, there were less than 700 people from Oceania in Oslo.
Alna, in the northeast of the city, was the borough with the most foreign residents. Some 18,257 foreign residents were registered as living there in 2022. Afterwards, trendy Grünerløkka, located reasonably centrally, had the second highest number of foreign residents, with 17,631. Gamle Oslo also had a significant immigrant population, with 17,631 people living there after moving from another country.
Statistics Norway's figures showed that foreigners were scattered all over the city's districts, as Søndre Nordstrand, the borough furthest south in Oslo, had over 14,000 immigrants registered there. Many immigrants also lived in sought-after areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth most foreigners. After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene made up the rest of the ten districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country.
At the other end of the spectrum, just 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the city's central borough. Ullern, Vestre Aker and Nordstrand made up the other boroughs with the fewest foreign residents. However, these boroughs had significantly more immigrants living there than in central Oslo and Marka. Those from EU and EEA countries and those from the United Kingdom mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo and St. Hanshaugen. Meanwhile, while plenty of citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also resided in Game Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered as living in the boroughs of Alna, Stovner and Søndre Nordstrand.
Gamle Oslo and Alna were the two parts of the city where the largest number of immigrants from Africa lived, along with Stovner, Grünerløkka and Søndre Norstrand. Those from North America were spread fairly evenly across Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, Vestre Aker and Nordre Aker. Citizens from South and Central America were most commonly found in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo St.Hanshaugen and Sagene. Europeans from outside the EU, EEA and UK tended to live in the town's most central borough, Ullern, Vestre Aker, Nordre Aker and Stovner. And finally, of the several hundred nationals from Oceania, Frogner, Grünerløkka and Gamle Oslo were the boroughs with the highest populations of these nationals.
Zimbabwe to Start Operating New Coal Power Unit by March
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will start operating a new unit at its only coal-fired power plant by March, says the country's deputy energy minister, providing relief to millions of citizens rocked by frequent power outages in recent months. The new unit of the Hwange power plant will lift the African nation's installed capacity by more than 14% to 2400 megawatts. The next unit is expected to be commissioned soon after, Magna Mudyiwa said, without giving a timeline.
Less than half of Zimbabwe's 16 million citizens have access to electricity, and a global squeeze on funding new coal-fired capacity has limited the country's ability to plug chronic power cuts that have lasted as long as 18 hours in recent days. "We have the capacity to generate up to 2100 megawatts (MW) from our power sources but at the moment we're generating far less than that..about 1000MW," Mudyiwa told Reuters. "But our demand for electricity is about 1700MW so we have a serious deficit," she said. Deficient rainfall has led to a decline in hydropower generation, while the efficiency of the sole, decades-old coal-fired utility has dipped sharply over time while power demand has surged in recent years due to higher mining and agricultural activity. The International Monetary Fund counts electricity shortages as one of the major factors weighing on Zimbabwe's growth prospects. Lack of funding for coal-fired power is driving the mining and agriculture-dependent economy to import costly power from regional neighbors including Zambia and Mozambique.
The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.
Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.
To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object.
Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end. But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.
So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.
Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support. Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.
Scientific facts result from experiments. The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered. Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts. It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.
Going to be my first project car.
Picking this up this weekend. I was looking for a good first car guy car; and I really love the 80s aesthetic. Already on coil overs and lowered ride height. I've done a little research but I would love if anyone has any info about this car. Personal experiences? I know they're not fast compared
#Venting into the Fediverse time. The Domestic Partner and I went to the liquor store tonight for some beers and a bottle of bub. When we went to check out, the cashier is a fairly obvious #trans woman. Me, in board shorts and a wife beater, and The Domestic Partner, all tatted up and with a new haircut that he himself described as "making me look like a neo-nazi". Her body immediately stiffened and there was this look of fear in her eyes.
And then we just... paid for our stuff. And said thank you. And I said her nails looked cool. The smile of relief on her face was a great feeling but the fact that she was scared first FUCKING SUCKS AND I HATE IT.
This is the stupidest timeline and I hate it dot com.
Nothing stops Donald Trump from running for president while under indictment, after being convicted, or even from within a prison cell. If elected, he would undoubtedly pardon himself to get out of prison.
But he can't pardon himself out of state prison. It takes the state's governor. The two states involved are New York and Georgia. The latter's Governor Kemp will undoubtedly pardon Trump if convicted or even indicted by Fulton County DA Fannie Willis. NY is the best hope for accountability
There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning. In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario. In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence. At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings. We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end. Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication. We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts. The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy.
I really enjoyed catching up with Penny and Nicholas from Ashanti Development at the weekend for a chat about their progress.
Ashanti Development has been working with an ever-expanding number of communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana for approaching 20 years, engaging with communities and providing support with water and sanitation, education, healthcare, tree planting and farming. Communities gain the knowledge to embed and support their own development.
I was fortunate enough to spend a memorable six months alongside Nicholas in 2011 supporting a range of projects. When we caught up at the weekend I was chuffed to hear about progress, particularly with tree planting and farm support. Thousands of trees have been established and farmers have seen increased crop yields through a range of interventions from support with equipment purchases to training.
Nicholas is working with farmers to reduce pesticide use while finding ways to address the issues caused by climate change and pests such as fall armyworm, which can devastate maize crops.

I have to email some random address, with unformatted data, so the clerk can read the email and enter it into their system to print a label.
And they always to charge me $2.25 for that "convenience".
The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night. It was an outrage, like a symbolic Jan 6 anti-democratic festivus of lies & grievance, self-destructively hosted by American media. THE SHAMEFUL AUDIENCE. Licht AGREED to an all Republican audience! Who vetted & chose the individuals? There's a story to be reported there. The ratings--seeking delusional irresponsibility of it all. It can't be repeated.
I have a very drafty basement, which essentially means I can get a lot of rodents taking refuge. There have been a lot of signs of more rodents this past month or so, which has been exceptionally surprising as it's spring and I would have thought they would venture outdoors with the change in weather.
Nonetheless, I've had a smattering of plain old snap-traps placed about, and would dutifully replenish the peanut butter on them every few days, as the mice kindly lick it clean. I finally got fed up with this routine last night, cleaned all the traps of peanut butter, and superglued a pistachio to them. It worked.
(fwiw, I've tried nearly every "humane" trap on the market with very little success. I'm not especially happy with killing them, but I won't be taking comments on the ethics of killing mice.)
I'm tired of conservative parties and governments wrapping themselves in the brand of pro-business. They aren't, at least not in Alberta.
Sure they cut business taxes. But they also cut grants and tax credits that encourage more business activity.
I own a business. It's successful in spite of the provincial government, not because of it.
Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station web sites are the absolute worst experience on the internet. Popups, auto-play videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads. I know that advertising is how they make their money, but all that garbage seems counterproductive if it drives people away. This is true even now that goatse.cx is gone, though it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video the Wendy sent me.
On the first train today, the ticket checker looked at our tickets and said "long journey!"
"Yeah and I'm coming back today," I said. "I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow," I attempted to explain, gesturing at my traveling companion.
"There's not something you hear a lot 'I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow,' " the ticket guy said.
It's a thing I've never said before either.
The thing that last night convinced me of is that we need to be ready to fight back against Trumpism. Trumpism is a cult. It is a cult that nobody really wants, except for the fanatics who are in it. And they are truly nuts. We can not allow them to hijack our country. It is time to fight back.
Go out and protest now. Get some bumper stickers that are anti-Trump and plaster them all over. Yell back at those who would try to talk over us.
This is not normal. This is not OK...
My neighbor & I arrived home at the same time and I could hear him coughing up a covid mucus storm from across the street. So I rushed to get into my apt to avoid him but he still managed to catch up to me to chat. I swear covid-infected people are zombies trying to infect everyone else.
It is not socially acceptable to go out in public or rush up to people when you are coughing up a mucus storm. I repeat. It is not socially acceptable to spread your covid mucus storm everywhere!!!
Writing Wonders 5/11: Does your MC laugh or cry more?
Abe keeps his sorrows hidden and laughs easily while Tom is not afraid to cry but is less amused by rude humor. Jan will hurt you before she lets you see she's hurt and laughs most when things are upside-down. Mio knows that sorrow is life's constant companion.
After 4,000 of distress Yl finds herself in a place of love and is having huge feels she doesn't know what to do with so there's a lot of both.
#CNN needs to just close down. Yesterday's fiasco with #MangoMoron was an outrageous fiasco. Who at that pathetic, dying network was responsible for vetting the so-called "independent voters" in the audience? Which cable news "executive" made the call to give the fat, lying criminal this much air-time?
High pressure will prevail through early next week. A cold front should arrive by the middle of next week.

One of the craziest parts about my neighbors turning against me is thinking about how much effort it takes to be hostile.
Forget me, fine. Ignore me, fine. It hurts but you gotta do you.
But at this point the open hostility and violence is getting worse. That takes effort. Slamming a door in my face takes effort. Our dogs used to be BEST FRIENDS.
And I still have NO IDEA what I could have possibly done to deserve this.
They had keys to my apartment for 6+ years.
That vessel is off-limits. I am aware of your hatred of Organa. She is irrelevant to me. You may kill her if you can. But another individual often flies aboard that ship. If he were to die... the consequences would be... significant.
I gripe about dad-ification a lot. Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:
It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger).
The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification. Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as "caring."
Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic.
Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has.
In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success.

- We send out notifications when airfare goes on sale. - We provide links to where you can book the fare. - We don't sell tickets, or charge a subscription. - More details are in the full blog post. - We maintain a list of example booking dates for each deal we post and we update that list several times a day.
Ukrainian children have a right to grow up in a peaceful and secure environment.
Yet, unimaginable fear, terror and displacement have left them with the invisible scar of trauma.
This Tuesday, President von der Leyen met First Lady Olena Zelenska in Kyiv to discuss how to support her efforts to provide mental health assistance to vulnerable children.
We have already offered mental health and psychosocial support.
All our efforts will help them make it through this journey.
A bunch of shiny new goodness in #dart
Over time dart became my go-to for quick UI. #flutter is a pleasure to work with, and they have #mobx for easy store management. The dependency story is less insane than nodejs, too.
Of course flutter sucks really bad when it comes to behaving like a good native app would (anywhere, really. Even flutter web target sucks). But it allows to move fast and that's why it's ideal for small hacks.
Echidna with amethyst and magenta spikes. They are average height, has an average build and muscular. Their tail is extremely thick. Their hair is raspberry, short and curly. Their eyes are pear and they wear scarlet cateye glasses. Their most interesting feature is their good deeds.
Looking for a list of the best vampire games on PC? Being able to jump really high, tear regular humans to shreds, use creepy magic powers, and replenish health by feasting on your enemies - this should be a staple of all PC games, to be honest. Despite the best efforts of Bram Stoker, Max Schreck, and Stephenie Meyer in trying to make them look bad - everyone ...
Dreamed my parents were playing my porn game and giving me feedback.
In real life, my mom did like a puzzle game I made years ago, and she found most of the secrets on her own, so she wasn't just being mom when she said she liked it. So maybe she'll like my porn game too?
It maybe has too many language subtleties. Need to translate it to Mandarin and/or Hokkien, neither of which I know at all.
Guess I'll have to see whether Bing or Google is better at translating dirty gay sex puns.
Been toying with this thought for a little while:
Mental health is often seen as something separate from "regular" health. Why? Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health. In truth, the health of your mind, of your brain, is just as much an issue of health as the health of your foot.
Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible. In the same way that mental health is seen as less "real" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind.
The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of "My sex is male, my gender is female" seems simplistic and inaccurate. It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs. I feel that to be trans is to be "biologically non-binary". My sex is non-binary, my gender is female.
I think the designation of "non-binary" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex.
I've been, on and off, listening to the works of @iotar
There's a lot of well good stuff in this mysterious collective's backlog. Like krauty moods and other worldly pop music and radiophonic workshop and all sorts. Very much worth having a go at.
Also FWIW I like the archive.org interface a lot more than the desktop #bandcamp \- I've no idea how people use bc as their primary music platform (besides the political reasons).
Playing around a bit with Flutter. I'd hate to base my business on tech from Google, to be honest, on the other hand Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross platform experience and it shows.
(And also: The Web is now largely a Google thing, unfortunately)
Also please refrain from telling me that google/flutter apps suck on iOS and macOS. Cross platform is hard if you want to do it well. I know that.
Thank you to those people who have downloaded the latest update to Leasey. A few very small difficulties have come to light. Nothing to set alarm bells ringing but nevertheless they are being addressed. A small update will be produced next week to correct them. Most of yesterday was spent installing the new update for some customers, and everyone who does need that assistance should have received it by now. Have a good day!
Tech confession: I can't wrap my head around Grafana & Prometheus, at least from a server/application metrics and monitoring standpoint.
I don't know exactly know why my brain can't figure it out; it might be that the tools are just so broad and vague that my brain just hardlocks due to 'too many options'.
I want to make dashboards. Grafana looks pretty. Brain no work.
So with a new #FFXIV raid tier approaching, I've long been thinking "man, I'd like to try proper raiding, but Party Finder sounds like a mess, and I'm never gonna find a static that'll have me."
So I thought, screw it! I'll make my own static! Full of people too anxious to try joining a raid static, with no expectations of being good at all! There's... no way that would work, probably!
...And that's how I found myself having to sort out a raid group roster.
I was a voracious reader in my youth. Then, life crushed my soul and I lost all my passion for fiction and great storytelling.
But, after ~decades~ of reading next to nothing (with the exception of functional work-related non-fiction stuff and an occasional self-help book) I set a goal to read 23 books in 2023.
I'm now on book # 31 and it's only May.
I'm BACK baby!
I haven't really achieved anything. I'm happy that a few people have come to me in private and said "look, because of all your work, I'm gonna grant you this amount of money".
I wanna see these companies that intermediate transactions explain to their customers how they set their percentages. They're not gonna talk about this on Bloomberg! But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.
Is it a danger to let migrants in at the southern border? I dunno. Let them rehabilitate the hollowed out and decaying cities across the country. Again. These people want to improve their lives.
White nationalists, gun fetishists, pro-dictator right wing.. there's the danger. Deport the white supremacists.
I am so tired of the headlines claiming that "Remote work is dead." or that "Remote work was a failed experiment."
These headlines and articles usually reference one CEO at one large company. It's all clickbait but it does worry me about the executives and managers who read these articles.
There was remote work prior to 2020. There are still going to be jobs that can be accomplished remotely for the foreseeable future.
Remote work is enabling. It enables people to work in comfortable spaces and not stuffy, noisy offices. It enables accessibility for anyone with an internet connection and a good working space. It enables people to avoid lengthy commutes that take time away from their day and their families.
To just ignore these facts is wrong. Stop generalizing and try to understand how your employees actually get work done.

It's not just conservatives versus progressives, he told a seminar of more than 100 adherents in Grande Prairie.
"This is a war between the pro-humans and anti-humans," he said. Parker referred to abortion, and modern urban women's impulse to delay having children for their careers' sake.
He also argues that NDP and progressives want to depopulate society for the sake of the environment. "You are the carbon they are trying to reduce."
So like from the beginning for all my birthdays in the past, I always had rough ones. Whenever May would pop up I dreaded trying to celebrate my bday. Something would always happen, go wrong, or just end up stressful and depressing. I fought over the years to get out of that mindset and to have better bdays. It took years of changing my life and working hard but finally... I'm starting to smile and enjoy my bday with no worries. And today is already becoming a great day!
Winter is 30 days away in this little part of the Great Southern World. But I can't be deceived! This is the beginning. The rain is falling and whilst/while it is not frozen, you ain't going dancing in it! It's a fine day to order ice cream delivery. It was a one dog night and that doggo was not getting off the bed not even for "Dog's Breakfast - Breakfast for Dog's!"
I will zip the lining into my cycle jacket - just in case I need it inside.
Does you know of a performant way for a web component to respond to being added/removed from a document?
This is for Wikipedia's component library (OOUI). It is mostly semantic HTML with CSS, and generally does not require custom elements (which offers connectedCallback).
We currently use a MutationObserver hack. For performance, we don't observe the whole document. We create a detached temp parent, install MO there, and observe it becoming detached (thus attached elsewhere).
Casper the #rat is an absolute unit these days. I think my new job has been good for him - two free roams a day while I work, at fairly predictable times.
I finally got a good dangle photo so I can be sure he's not fat. (In #rats, too high body fat can be bad for their health.) He's not. He's just absolutely ripped from tearing around my office twice a day. I don't have a scale to weigh him, but he feels like he's well over a pound. It makes me so happy to see him thriving.

It's 2023 and I still see people with iPhones actively avoid using Apple Maps.
Apple Maps comes default with iOS, and yet people would go out of their way to download and install Google Maps onto their iPhones.
No idea why.
Curious, I kept an open mind to compare how Google Maps and Apple Maps compare, on my test iPhone device (my daily driver is an Android device, so it's rare that I use an iPhone).
The experience having to follow directions was far superior on Apple Maps compared to Google Maps. Apple Maps wins.
So why is it that people jump through extra hoops to install Google Maps?
No idea.
Could it be that Google Maps got to market first?
Was it the 2012 Apple Maps disaster?
Could it be that Google Search is integrated with Google Maps?
No idea.
That said, I'm biased.
I'm biased in favour of not releasing garbage to end users, and Apple royally fucked up with their Apple Maps when it came out in 2012.
Their bad reputation haunts them to this day.
But it's the land that makes it a good storer of wealth for as long as you think the government isn't going to change the system we live in. The house itself declines in value because it loses its condition and needs to be replaced. A lot of ppl think that they literally own the earth when they buy a piece. Not the case. In China you can only lease land. They're not stupid enough to sell the sell forever. The government can change these policies whenever it wants. The land is temporary.
It seems inconceivable that land may be taken away one day when you watch Australian and United States media channels but that's because the rich are on there all day ensuring your mind thinks a certain way. The land is very easily and quickly taken away by the government one day if they want to do that. And guess what? It never made sense how ppl can keep land at the expense of others. It has to be taken away one day. That's why the Chinese only allow leases. They already ran out of land.

I often wonder at the human capacity to be *so* down on oneself while inundated by so much evidence of what actual cruelty looks like.
To agonize over personal failure & guilt in a world where "success" is so often bestowed on people responsible for the most reprehensible acts...
We're all such messy critters.
But gentling despair at our messiness is crucial - because it gives us more space to tackle the ruins all around.
So try not to forget, eh?
Kindness with ourselves is activism, too.

The prompt this week on Revelations is Stay up all night. I have been toying with this little piece on my head for a few days now. It is definitely more romance than filth. Maybe I have been reading to many romances with impossible 'meet cutes' and this is the result, but I like it. Also one day I am totally gonna do the mile high orgasm, maybe not with a str
I don't agree that #Mastodon is difficult to setup. Common, it's really not that hard. But it's more difficult to find people to follow and build up your timeline. I wish there was a "who to follow" recommendation somehow.
But apart from this, it is not difficult - if you use a 3rd party app like Elk and/or Ivory. If you stick to the default web interface it doesn't look and feel good (imho).
So, it requires a bit more effort to get into it and you probably need a good app to improve #UX.
I don't know if prevention is possible, but it's worth trying. The four steps I outline are up for debate, with some progress in each:
Description: names for incidents of human-algorithm behavior that account for algorithms & humans. Explanation: account for both sides of mutual influence
Forecasting: anticipating harms before they happen (even if by minutes) Interventions: knowledge about things we can do to create change, within some confidence bounds
I didn't watch the CNN town hall, but it seems as if Trump said exactly the same things he says every time he opens his mouth or presses Send on his phone. Even if he didn't get to say them during the town hall, everyone in America will hear them anyway, repeatedly, between now and November 2024.
That's still no reason to give him another venue, but the harm is being exaggerated. He'll win the primaries. We can't will him away. He's here and he's going to say this stuff no matter what.
Signed up for Google's "AI Test Kitchen" waitlist and got in same day. It's very underwhelming at the moment.
The "MusicLM Demo" is mildly interesting. You can ask for a specific piece of music like "jazz with a trumpet solo in 5/4 tempo" and it will generate two tracks for you after a few seconds. It seems to understand tempo, but... the music's just... not good.
Throwing everything you've got over the fence in response to GPT is not it. Try harder Google.
It's weird doing weightlifting but also having no real clue what your one-rep-max is, cus that's one of the key ways people track their progress. I work out alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack. Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights. I bench press on my bed. If I try and figure out my one rep max is I might not own enough weights to max out, or conversely it could seriously injure/kill me. Anyway, load is going up today. Still feels good.
I swear burrata didn't exist five years ago
This is my personal Mandela effect thing. I'd never seen it in a cookbook. I'd never seen it at the fancy grocer or any of the Italian delis. I'd never seen anyone's mom make it or had it shoved at me at a party or seen it appear in conjunction with anyone's saucemaking escapades or baking days
It just appeared one day and suddenly it was available everywhere. I've entered the burrata dimension.
drake's aging iPad is giving out, so she's in the market for a new tablet. Having been radicalized here, we're reluctant to buy a new FAANG machine*. Does anyone have a Linux tablet they love?
This would be mainly for web browsing, occasional email, and some games.
In 1998-06 Gamefan, in relation to the long development of the first Unreal game, Jason Schrieber commented,
"A good game is only late until it ships. A bad game is bad forever."
So was it Epic that originated this? We can keep going.
An earlier issue of GamePro 1997-11 has a quote with far more ambiguity,
"Or, as an industry catch phrase goes: A late game is only late until it ships. A bad game is bad for the rest of your life."
Is it so ephemeral then? Merely a "catchphrase" with no clear originator?

Have now done a full round trip on the new ICNG train. I really like it. Esp the carriages with the bigger windows. There's areas that could use some polish. Namely the lack of enough bins, and the lack of signs to explain the significance of the lighting colours.
Fix those minor issues, and then can we have more of these please? I won't be sad to see the end of the ICM or DDZ stock.

#FalconGameBooks
The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching as you settle the flyer down on the red soil, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you climb out of the flyer and walk slowly towards them. The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shake, as if in an earthquake and you lose your footing, though the Repnids seem unaffected. The rock beneath you gives way suddenly. Repnids have tunnelled below the surface and you fall into a boiling mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cavern below. The end is swift, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. Nobody will ever know that you were the first human future traveller.
You land the flyer nose upward on the side of the slag heap and climb out. The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you walk slowly towards them. You halt while still on the mound of crumbled rock and soil and speak to them, saying, 'I come in peace, as a friend.' It appears that they cannot hear you, let alone understand, as your Universal Translator picks up no answer. You decide to use your Psychic Awareness to contact them mentally. It is difficult to make sense of their thoughts; they are terrifyingly alien and your mind recoils from the contact. You decide that establishing contact again would be dangerous and return to your flyer, but the experience has cleared your mind which had been befuddled ever since you jumped into the future. Once back in Falcon's Wing you find it quite easy to plot a course for Earth in 3034 AD. Note that you have used up another polybdenum rod as you jump.

#today I have coffee, sunshine and quiet time! I started a new shawl. I am unsure of it at this time. I found a unevenly spun silver gray yarn that is mostly finely spun with lumps. I plan on mixing it with a fine purple/lilac variegated cotton. But am not sure I have enough of the purple. I am using a H hook with a similar double crochet pattern as I have done before. I made the first join last night so we shall see. Wishing everyone a happy Thursday!
However, I hate classes on fine arts and literature, and my school history bears it out.
I have literally tried and dropped EVERY SINGLE ONE. And up until like two years ago, I had no idea until I checked my transcripts.
The literature class hatred is even worse: I love to read. I hit most of the classics before eighteen--though that's more a reflection of living in bumfuck nowhere, I also read the 1979 Encyclopedia Brittanica in desperation.
My home is comfortable and wonderful and I am happy there, but I have to be somewhere else in order to chill enough to read fiction during the day without feeling guilty. It's like I'm on holidays and therefore am doing what one does on holidays.
And that's also even though I haven't slept as well here for the last two nights as I do at home, and get a little #MECFS ed out from simply being in a strange environment where I'm less able to pace myself and have to remember where things are.
And that's also even though I do still have my to-do list and am organising my life as well.
Humanity is out in 5 days. It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things that I love about working in games. What will people think of it? I like it but will it be able to attract an audience of the right players? Will a community blossom around the user-generated content piece of the game? (I am really hoping so.) The game's story, ideas and questions it inspires feel timely. Hoping things go well.
It's ThinkPad day!! Came home on my lunch break to see this sitting outside uwu. Wish I could take it back to work with me to setup more. But that will have to wait till tonight.
So I finally watched #Heartstopper
Was it overly cute to the point of being twee? Most definitely
Do any of these characters talk human beings? Not even remotely
But did I love it? Absolutely!
what was Olivia Coleman doing here? Did she owe someone money?
Had a recent graduate artist take some critique badly tonight. In part, because they'd be taught badly. But it's important to not make excuses for issues and just fix them, especially in production when your lead needs changes. Especially with the competition.
Every artist has been there, made the same mistakes. Good critique is there to correct the problem quickly, and isn't directed at your ability. It's assuming you have the ability to fix the problem, or find a solution.
So while composting and bloom scrolling are a wonderful reminder to look up, and be aware of life beyond the screen. It is as important to explore servers and IP addresses. Watch seeds being sown & cultivated (and not randomly scattered) by good peeps. These roots are hidden. Work is not visible. But for strong and firm future growth.
Jami slipped the note to him when they passed each other on the path, just before the dog watch. She was on her way to the wall, he was coming off duty. He glanced behind him to watch her go, and to make sure they hadn't been seen. She did not look back. He waited until he was in the darkness of the bunk room before he pulled the note out and read it in a beam of light coming through the blackout curtains. One block-printed word. He spent a long time staring at it, trying to stay calm:
I've met some marvelous new #Mastodon mates lately and want to maintain the trend. Calling into the #Fediverse makes me feel like a whale singing through the vast ocean! Want to join my "pod"? I'd particularly like to connect with more.
Everyone with their hair on fire about CNN can thank Stephen Colbert for the hard right turn. He helped make Chris Licht a national problem.

This was the first time (but won't be the last) that Kaveesha Dilhari has both scored 20+ runs & taken 2+ wickets in the same T20I. She joins a select group of Sri Lankan women to have achieved the all-round feat in the format.
(PERSON11) But for some folders, for some reason, the audio format is wrong, so, something is wrongly – Basically, the big trade, or something is wrong. So, some files are still – still have weird output. But – but for most folders, it should be already fine.
(PERSON1) Okay, thanks.
(PERSON6) Yeah, that's great. I support this, it's great that, [PERSON7], you have thought of [PERSON11]. And [PERSON11] now has the time. There are other things where I was thinking of [PERSON11] and that would be training of, empty systems, so that they do the shortening. So, if you, [PERSON11], had the time. Obviously, there is no way we could do it for next week. But we should really have the system – ready for – I looked at the tutorial from the NLP – was it?
(PERSON6) For the upcoming sessions and I've asked about demand because I've seen the (meme) project demo. They do offline subtitling. So, that's slightly easier than what we do. They still have the same segmentation issues and so on. But their mission in translation is shortening simply because the data is shortening. And that's because their target size is the subtitles, which are created for the hearing-impaired. So, there is like a natural shortening in the data. It'd be great if we could also locate such a type of data where there is some natural shortening happening. We would put it in the architecture.
(PERSON8) That takes a bit of time, because I need to figure out which one is the one which is getting passes. So, once I know that, I can keep a track of it, so, for the future – Or actually, for future I would not need it, because once I have the web file, I probably won't need to do a convert.
(PERSON6) Well, this, this should actually be – Can you still hear me? The sound quality is a little worse. So, this should really be done, all the time. So, every time we run this evaluation, it should be run from scratch. So, every time, there should be a fresh download of a fresh conversion and a fresh evaluation.
(PERSON8) But still, if I am keeping track of the files that need to be manually converted, so that I can write a script, and it could take care of the known ones at least, and of course, if we add some new files, I can see for that later.
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have come across months ago. Remember, it is since August that I've been telling you that we want to evaluate on a later test set. And every time, you all... It is not just you personally, [PERSON8]. There were other things, obviously. But every time you thought about that, you thought "this will be easy, we will just run it". And only when you actually do it, do you see all the problems. So, this is known, common. It is always like that. So that's a message for everybody. Before you try, you never know what the problem will be. So, for example, the call that I had, in which someone was interviewing me, so they wanted to record the video. Zoom never worked as badly for me as it did today for the recording. So, before you do it, you cannot say whether it will work or not. And here we are running into the problems of conversion of the file formats. So, hopefully, we will be able to quickly get the numbers. So, do you have any word error rates so far?
(PERSON8) No, I have not processed it. So [PERSON1] said that, once, they get the transcript, we will do it together.
And then, I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary. So, I asked that you would have various versions of this dictionary by taking only the words that were observed, five times. And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that. So, that way, these random errors, such as the example with this four IBM instead of IBM. This will not be so frequent. But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person, says this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the in the talk, then you will see that in the data with the "Z". And if he sometimes manages to say also correctly, then yeah, again, you will see that in the data. So, I would like, [PERSON4] to be in touch with [PERSON2]. Maybe you continue on the call, right? I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids lunch and so on. But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary. So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system is accepting. Share your screen and show it. And [PERSON2], please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file. One thing that will still be needed is the language model substitute. But all these words should be known words. So [PERSON4], you need to figure out what words are in the language model. And the words which are in the language model should be simply copied. So, the dictionary will have three col ns. The grapheme, as it is output. One recognized. The phonemes, as [PERSON2] proposed. And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations. And the third col n will be also the same again for all of those, and again there will be the same grapheme form. So that is when the language model sees. And I think that this way, these systems should be able to load it. And you will also possibly run into one more problem: that it is not ready for two big custom dictionaries. So, this is also something that has to be tested, but please test it, the two of you together. So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary. And you know what the dictionary looks like when you are creating it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together. Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON6) So [PERSON2], does this make sense?
(PERSON2) Yeah, sure, we'll discuss it.
(PERSON6) Yeah, so is there anything else, [PERSON2], that you have?
(PERSON2) Well, maybe interesting information for Dominik. I'm finishing training of a German ASR that may be used for time stamping. I'm not sure how good it will be because I'm trying to do it on (Libry) Speech. And, though, when I was downloading it, they claimed it had more than 600 hours. But then the training said that the actual training set contained only around 300 hours. And I'm still not sure whether these 300 hours do not contain similar sentences. Or actually the same sentences but spoken by different speakers. For example, in English or Czech I used to observe steeper conversions. And now it won't convert so fast. So, if we take some samples during the training. Then there are still some serious errors in the ASR output. So, I'm hopeful that for the time stamping, it is good enough. Or at least we might try it.
(PERSON17) Okay, that's good, yeah. So, I started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you reminded me, [PERSON8], that your profanity filtering is not yet integrated. And I think this is also an important message for [PERSON5], who has disappeared again from the call. So, the important message is that yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated, and everybody should do so. And at the same time, we need to have the setup, so that you can actually integrate and test it yourself. So, I call it "do-it-yourself integration". So, [PERSON8], when working with [PERSON5] and when documenting what the setups are, make sure it is tested well enough by colleagues, such as [PERSON4] or even [PERSON9] for the language model checks and everybody else. So, whenever someone develops a new useful component, the full pipeline should be accessible to him reasonably easily, so he can test it himself. So, this do-it-yourself integration is important, because otherwise it will all remain on you, [PERSON8], and you don't want to be overloaded. So, you want to provide these people with inputs and outputs as the first testing approach, which has already been done. [PERSON4], right? The profanity filtering, has it been tested on logs? I think it was.
(PERSON8) Yeah, it was tested on logs, I think. So, now it's time to test it on the live pipelines. And again, I think it's better if [PERSON8] explains to [PERSON4] how to do it, so that [PERSON4] runs it for himself some of the workers and live playing some of the problematic file like using [PROJECT8] or whatever. Simply play them. Follow the sound output on your machine and see how that works. Because only when doing the real setup will the true errors appear. It is important to first debug it, using the log files, and then it's important to debug it in the pipeline. And if this debugging can be done by the author of that component, here, in this case [PERSON4], it would be most efficient for all of us. So, [PERSON8], please confirm that you agree with this idea of like do-it-yourself integration.
(PERSON17) Yeah, so for the multi-accent English. So, we are now [PERSON14] putting that together to just one technical solution. The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers. So, it will be really multi-speaker sentences, and therefore the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved. Ah, so that's one particle experiment. And later on, we may do something more about the multi-accent thing. So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment. One problem is the implicit language model. So, the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences. And we are going to create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part to that, so that the language model will be better for the ASR, and the robustness to different speakers would be also better. And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea. It was during the training. They were dropping out time bands and frequency bands from the sound. So, they were training on disrupted inputs, and that also greatly improved the robustness of the system.
(PERSON17) Anyone else can work on the non-native accent thing. Ok, then another thing that I spotted is - this is in the Monday test document. It is highlighted four times. So, when some session is happening, we need the names and terminology for that session. And we need to collect it, prepare it manually, create it somewhat. And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible. So, there is a certain skill b in that, which needs to be practiced. So, I'm quite skilled at shuffling text files. And whenever I see any of any of you doing that, then I like always have tips in my head of what could be done faster. Maybe it is not faster for your end, but at least you should consider it. So there this skill is something that that we need people to have. And we need someone to be responsible for that. And I'm afraid that the only person for this could be [PERSON8]. If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation, the data crunching, please say so. And then we need - So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations, we need techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems. So, my impression from the domain adaptation that [PERSON9] has been carefully doing for all the sessions was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR. So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday. [PERSON9] is already starting the data collection, but I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in in in the [PROJECT5] set up. So, maybe [PERSON9] and [PERSON8], because he's learning how to do domain adaptation and [PERSON14], because he is doing how to work with [PROJECT5]. If you three could meet and double check what is [PROJECT5] doing with the - It's not [PROJECT5], actually, the domain adaptation is for the [PERSON18] toolkit, right.
So, this is kind of backward-looking, making sure that the old approach works. At the moment it is absolutely impossible to do any domain adaptation for the fully neural ASR. So, what I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting from sound and some merging procedure. So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time. End-to-end ASR, which is better in general. And then domain-adapted [PROJECT5] setup, which is used only to spot the keywords. And when we see a keyword in the domain-adapted version then we would then we would use that sentence from [PROJECT5], which is in general worse, but contains the right terms. So that's my suggestion of what we could do. And another suggestion is that we really should have our own fully neural ASR and do various experiments on finetuning and all that. So, we have discussed this with [PERSON14]. And, [PERSON14], is there any update from the potential colleague or friend of yours?
(PERSON17) Yeah, so if there is anyone else who'd be curious about this please let me know or get in touch. So, it's this is something which is which would really be accepted well in generally as a as a paper, because people don't do that yet. And that's the most urgent problem these days. So, we really could make an impact there.
(PERSON6) Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about like what kinds of data we currently use for this, because, for example, like if you check like [ORGANIZATION4]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5] that they are like already pretty good at these things -
(PERSON6) And I think that if we just like - We could probably just get the data from them, because you have like a such a large set of videos basically with different domains and different speaker native languages on [ORGANIZATION5]. And I had this idea that we could just like use some tool to download basically some kinds of filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make training tests a training set out of them.
So, I plan to do it myself. I plan to go there, but we need a backup person. And also, for the [PROJEC210] event we need someone to take care of the recording, So, the archiver person, so that we don't lose that session again. And the more important and still persisting topic to work on is ladder climbing. And I've suggested here in the paragraph for [PERSON2] that we could use simple html tables that would be autogenerated and that that would grow. I think that that would be probably the easiest to just put up the tables as html, but it could get difficult when we want to see the differences, as new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign. It may be difficult to prepare these tables. So, I asked [PERSON7] and [PERSON7] unfortunately won't be available during this call. To tell us whether [ORGANISATION242], which is a web-based solution. Some start-up company which offers accounts for academic purposes for free. If that would help us or not. Okay, so [ORGANISATION242] is not recommended by [PERSON7]. So, simple html is probably the way to go. So, as soon as [PERSON2] has these evaluations m cleaned up. So, that means moving the few scripts to where they belong from [PROJECT3] test set and some automatic runner. Then also please create a conversion from the tables into html similar to the tech conversion and then put these results regularly to your webpage. Or what you could even do is to have a full git check out directly located in this public html or singling from that public html. So that it would be immediately accessible through the web, and anybody could have a look at the current scorings and explore that. So, this would be useful, especially for m people outside of [ORGANISATION2] such as, [ORGANISATION15]. We know they have like - The performance was bad for some of the files, and they could directly m browse it on the web m. They could also browse it actually in on [ORGANISATION101]. This is up to you to set it up so that it's user-friendly and easy to follow.
(PERSON2) Okay, I'll do that.
(PERSON11) Yeah, thanks. I'm now working on, or getting to update, the demo paper submission, which is due next Friday, if I'm not mistaken. And then I have some project reports to do and I'm starting to gather documents - like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, for the two sessions.
(PERSON11) <parallel_talk> For ASR as well we should add a complimentary metric - Actually more, we should add complementary met- these complementary metrics. </parallel_talk> So, you mentioned one and that is profanity filtering m evaluation. So <parallel_talk> have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output </parallel_talk>, right? <parallel_talk> And then rare words evaluation. And here have an explicit list of names and terms that we do want to appear in the output, scored not simply by (order) rate </parallel_talk> but scored by something which directly accounts these things, right? Yes, so I totally agree. This involves also manual preparation of the reference. So, <parallel_talk> both need manually created references. </parallel_talk> I have one remark from [PERSON1]. So <parallel_talk> [PERSON1] has compiled some translation dictionary. And she should share it soon. </parallel_talk> So, this could become an empty part of the second thing of the rare word - So <parallel_talk> this would be the rare word evaluation for MT and then from [PROJEC210] we are also likely to get some dictionary. </parallel_talk> So that would be the [PROJEC210] domain obviously. And [PERSON2], could I ask you to revise the <unintelligible/> domain and create such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs. So, like shortlisting - listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the <unintelligible/> domain. Could you do that?
(PERSON11) It should be doable, so let's give it a try. It would be like - it would be great if you managed to do that. So, I'll write it down. So, <parallel_talk> aiming towards [ORGANISATION62] deadline with subtitler study paper. </parallel_talk> Yes <parallel_talk> and then then a multi-source with [PERSON7] or based upon [PERSON7] or - </parallel_talk> And for the language ID, I'm curious how do you want to integrate it exactly because it already involves considering multiple ASR sources, multiple channels, so what would be the use case for the for the language ID? How do we plug that in?
(PERSON13) It will be audio to text worker, and it will emit time stamps like for four or two second window and the class. <unintelligible/> silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it in the pipeline.
(PERSON11) That is important. Please write this down here into the documenter this <unintelligible/> summary, because that is for [PERSON2]. And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well and also possibly [PERSON5]. If we have this tool, we need to (ship) the audio to multiple ASR or multiple workers <unintelligible/> We will separately need to (ship) the audio to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other_noise/> And also, to this language ID worker and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is tool which we do not have yet. That's the multi-source tool, which will be observing the text outputs and also following the time stamps and it would emit the - it would probably like produce the output into three separate language channels for using either silence or the correct ASR. So, we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent if it's the wrong language and it is the recognized text if it's the correct language. I just made it up this type of setup. Another of setup would be that same sound is shipped to ASR and this language checker. This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR, silencing the ASR if it's the wrong language. That's also an option. So, we need to figure out which way of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes. So, please keep thinking about this like what are our pipelines. Ideally, I think that the least like management confusion and so on would arise if our MT models were multilingual. If they supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages into English. Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input, so we would have multi-lingual multiple ASRs at the beginning. All going into English, and then from the English will go into all of the languages. And later when [PERSON12] would have multi-lingual model of ASR, that language ID would not even be needed.
(PERSON3) The thing is, as long as we do the analysis more properly, one thing is the possible adversarial evaluation, just to indicate that that the constraints are actually having an impact on the actual output. That that would be nice and yeah possibly the attention analysis. But I'm not sure it might give us the same answers, basically, if the if the model attends or does not attend to the constraint.
(PERSON4) I had to look just at a few examples of attention, I did not do any statistics or anything, and it looks at the constraints, and when it translates the constraints, it looks like the constraints given, and I think it would be useful if the system made any errors, but it in fact does not do any in that sense. It makes some general translation errors but not the (phenomena) we are trying to solve. Well, going back to the automatic evaluation, the problem with mismatch is that the output is correctly inflected, but the context is different. Therefore, it is not the same word form as in reference, right?
(PERSON4) Yeah, but I have also checked if the contexts are valid translations and in most cases they are. Like in the first 100 examples that were marked as error by automatic evaluation 91 of them were correctly inflected in correct contexts.
(PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the incorrect context, like the translation was wrong. And then there are some cases where the translation was totally wrong, because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be <unintelligible/>, but that was just like one or two cases.
(PERSON3) But you are trying to match the divert forms when you are evaluating it, right? You do not do any-
(PERSON3) -lemmatization of the reference and the-
(PERSON4) Both, both, both, I'm matching both the surface forms and lemma.
(PERSON3) Oh I see, oh yeah, those are the two scores, right?
(PERSON4) It is just the dilemma score for the (European?) is not in the table because of the table like won't fit into the paper so <unintelligible/> Coverage is always like 97 percent. It just generates the correct lemmas, just-
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, okay, I get it, I get it. So basically, the lemma coverage says whether the constraint is there, and the surface coverage difference suggests that it might be incorrectly inflected, but that is not the case.
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, just I do not know if you if you, if you catch <unintelligible/> when we were talking about [PERSON1], but one thing, is, that, that the (blow) is better but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually properly inflected manually, but that is that is another, no, no problem, it is actually good that is <unintelligible/> right, yeah. So, I was thinking there might be. But I'm not sure whether we have some test data for that, but we might try to play around with the models with some sort of style transfer? As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how, how, what is the difference between the outputs. But this is, like I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself do not have an exact idea how to do it, but it might have been an interesting, distinct scenario. I do not know, [PERSON1], do you know about any style transfer data for English Czech? Do we have something?
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) By style transfer, Dusan, you mean that there would be something which is in the written language, and you would be the target side, would be in the spoken language or something like that?
(PERSON3) Well, that is the thing like, I have only a limited knowledge about the task. But I can imagine that you want to rewrite a sentence that it is not written by male, but it is written by a female instead or, I do not know, like you can have a scientific and unscientific explanation of certain phenomena. I'm not really that familiar with the exact data sets and what they cover. And the idea is that the style of the sentences gets quite vaguely defined. So again, not so sure.
(PERSON1) We have this corpus of sentence transformations. And one thing that is there and could be labelled as style transfer is for example, making the sentences more general. So, details are omitted, the sentence is simplified, and then making the sentence sound colloquial. Well, just a paraphrase. And I'm not sure if we have anything like shortening of the sentence. For shortening, Matous is doing some experiment with English–Czech, but we do not have any reference data there. So, we do not have any sentence compression dataset. So maybe the generalization could be of interest but I'm afraid that there are too many different good generalizations, so the single reference one would be too limited to tell you anything about the quality of your generalization. And I'm not aware of any like gender transformations, for example, this could be done <unintelligible/> for Czech, so maybe the right person would be Rudolf Rosa to ask him if he has ever generated any such dataset. So, there will be a root-based generation of some sentence counterpart.
(PERSON3) I guess that is actually like an interesting question whether we can use the constraints to enforce this kind of the like gender of the speaker in the in the translation.
(PERSON1) That is actually a very good idea. So, we could focus on that and create a particular sub-part of [PROJECT1] test set that would cover that. Ah so that we sometimes we know the gender of the speaker so if you are... maybe I'll share the screen and browse that.
(PERSON8) Or I tried it with Marian just attending it and it's... I don't know how many BLEU points lower.
(PERSON2) Because like the way I believe Martin does his <unintelligible/> little translation, so he translates more sentences at once and then picks only the centre one and goes like this for the whole document. So, the context is like in one <unintelligible/> together with sentence we actually want to translate.
(PERSON10) Yeah, I think - wasn't it Dominik doing some experiments with Ivana? I think the last year or two years ago for double empty where they were attending the context or concatenating the context with input sentence and doing some sort of document level translation. But the thing is with this with the concatenation is not completely sure whether it has the same effect as we do multi encoder setting-
(PERSON1) Like everybody is different, it's definitely a different calculation, different leader, but it's I'm surprised that [PERSON8] says that it doesn't work full stop.
(PERSON8) Yeah, okay, so sorry, maybe I should be more correct that it didn't work like in the way I did it <laugh/>
(PERSON1) Yeah, because I think it's a method which is very easy to test, and it always should be tested in contrast with the two encoders, and I would expect sometimes to be better and sometimes to be worse than the two encoders set up, depending on the exact task like what exactly is the second thing that you are encoding. So, maybe if you have two copies two paraphrases of the same sentence, maybe it is somehow confusing for the attention so whatever, I don't know. Behaviour also could be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods, compared to transformer, so for RNN then it behaved differently maybe with transformer it's yeah, it's harder to train so maybe you need to whatever increase warm-ups number, warm-up sets.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so just know like-
(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly but this is like what- when I started in summer with those multi-source experiments. The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and source and maybe I, I don't remember now, I can check it till the next meeting whether I tried also, I definitely tried when the sources are on the first position then some delimiter and the paraphrase on the second position. I might have also tried that I shuffled the two things randomly, yeah, and I just remember that it did abundantly this compenetration stuff and tried multi-encoders.
(PERSON8) And it was probably due to low scores.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> that you like can improve your amenity score by just appending phrase-based output and the attention is like double diagonal, so the attention is not an issue, so like I believe you but it's surprising that it didn't work.
(PERSON10) So, if you if you input the phrase-based output that's basically post editing, right? You can think about it as a postediting like you are postediting phrase-based output, right? Or like depends on the point of view, right?
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> that you like fully to rewrite it but technically it fits exactly the postediting task, you can plug this as a solution to the postediting task.
(PERSON10) Okay, so one question just for me just to make sure in the concatenation settings you insert the sentence separator token, right? You have a special token to distinguish like which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence or do you just concatenate them without anything? And hope that the system learns it?
(PERSON8) I tried to, I guess two tokens and yeah like because in the first version, we had a suspicion that the token could be also tokenized itself, so then I replayed it with another token which is not only for this purpose because we used some pretrained dictionary, and this dictionary didn't contain separator tokens. So, I used some token that I assumed that it wouldn't be like tokenized into several pieces and so it will appear once. I had no guarantee that this token couldn't appear in other places in the sentence and that is the only place it could appear. So, it could be done more properly, yeah, I agree.
(PERSON2) But the Flask part or the communication part with the client is something that I cannot do. Because I have no experience and no time to get it running.
(PERSON1) I thought it meant something using I don't know mediator.
(PERSON2) No, make a HTTP client which can fill the queue and read from another queue. And send the text back in a HTTP request. Because my idea is that the user clicks be used in the Ukrainian project too.
(PERSON2) And my idea is that a client clicks this microphone button and starts to speak, and when the user is speaking, you send the audio in small chunks at the same time. Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds. And to the HTTP server put it to a queue which I will handle the queue later with (ASR). And the model will do some logic, some inference with that. And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should get the partial transcript back. And it should be immediately displayed in the text field.
(PERSON1) I could think about that. Just I don't really know Flask either, but yeah, I can think about that.
(PERSON2) Oh maybe a different HTTP server. I don't know, maybe we don't even need a fancy HTTP server for that.
(PERSON1) I mean for text flow, we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
(PERSON2) Yeah, the only requirement is that it should handle more connection at a time.
(PERSON1) Well I think online text flow is something around 2 000 at least.
(PERSON1) I mean the script that I have in two different folders, and then will run it with the little different inside workers, so that I mean, yeah, so that I have <unintelligible/> let's say ten, well instead of an output, a file by a <unintelligible/> side worker, so <unintelligible/> that we have, so I'll just make sure that these things for a single file are getting generated parallelly from all the available workers.
(PERSON1) Oh that would save our time.
(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, this is very important to parallelize everything actually, parallelize both the processing of the systems as well as the evaluation of the cell DF, because he would need to run this many times, there will be errors, you need to re-run this quickly.
(PERSON7) Okay, so thanks. So, you are very busy with this, I don't want to put any other things on you, so let me start with the reminders. We need to finish the description of [PROJECT1] desk set, Who do we have here? Oh well, not really, yeah, (it's done) and it's not here unfortunately. So, this would be for [PERSON2], Then the evaluation, this is for [PERSON1], but we have discussed this. Listen, give me the table in DSD let's put the fine line here and push the template of the table, like the plan structure into the delebl now, so that the numbers will come later, but I want to see some numbers and the full structure of the table very soon.
(PERSON7) Okay, thank you. We have [PERSON5], that's good. So, for [PERSON5], I would like to check what is the progress in the evaluation of the systems, and whether you are in touch with [PERSON1] also for the evolution, which is more important. Can you hear us, [PERSON5]?
(PERSON1) and then, we'll figure out which packages to install in the Petri environment.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so there's another thing, Maybe it's not a good idea to combine these two runs into one setup. I think it is actually better if you run it separately and save the outputs. So, you first use the environment for cruise control and the processing,
(PERSON7) and you collect all the output files, and then you run the evaluation. And the reason for this split is that you can paralyze more. So, there will be problems on various fronts, I'm sure, and we will need the numbers very soon. So, if for example, some of the test files will fail for some reason, Then you can still keep the translation running for the remaining ones, and re-evaluate, with a sel T F, the missing ones, and, and so on. So, it's, the point is not to create a serial, sequential processing that includes both, but the point is to get the results, and it's actually better to do it in slices. First get all outputs, then we get all evaluations.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so, I mean, right now, I was doing the same.
(PERSON2) Yes, that's the only stuff I did for positive constraints. With the negative constraints I did something a little bit more complicated in the decoding. Like filtering out the beams and replacing the beams with different beams. And for like multi-token constraints and this kind of stuff. But for the positive constraints, I only compared the training approach with yeah just this very simple stuff. Just modifying the scores in each step in the same way.
(PERSON7) Okay, so back to the positive constraints. Were you already focusing on the analysis of the system?
(PERSON2) Yeah, right now, I'm kind of waiting for the dataset reprocessing from ([PERSON9]). Also [PERSON9] I had a look at the (code), and I think I know why it's so slow. Because for each entry in the terminology in the (Europar) reprocessing, you open the dataset, tokenize it, read it line by line, tokenize it line by line and then close it. But you only you do that -
(PERSON4) So, I remember that for [PROJECT1] I was doing this from last year from some cottage in the mountains. And I just realized, shortly before New Year’s Eve that I need to submit it. And <laugh/> so this is also something that will happen to [PERSON8] I'm afraid that he could be...well, no party, but maybe at the remote party. And then suddenly he would realize that he has to submit it. So, there will be no review of like at that point. <laugh/> He would simply take the PDF and upload it so. <laugh/>
(PERSON7) Well, okay. So, Yeah, I will check on 21st, and otherwise I will send them an e-mail.
(PERSON4) Please, I think better send them an e-mail right now and just ask for that link in advance.
(PERSON7) Okay.
(PERSON4) Yep thanks.
(PERSON7) Do we have other issues to discuss today, or is that is that everything until the New Year?
(PERSON6) I hope there wasn’t anything for me?
(PERSON3) Several years ago. MT marathons used to have this system or tool papers that were published as a special issue of PBML. That was in the first year when that happened. And then, in the subsequent years, it was integrated with normal like there were also PBML issues which mixed empty margin papers and separate papers because of the number of those papers. And we even had a thing like if the paper was not good enough for the PBML, but if the tool was presented at the MT marathon. The authors were invited to submit for another review for one for the next PBML issue. So, we have, even as I said, your system, your tool is interesting. Please publish it at the MT marathon among the people. But your paper is too bad. You need to improve it, and you will get only to the next PBML.
(PERSON4) Yes, but another possibility for SIGDial. Isn't it possible that trying SIGDial we attract kind of better participants.
(PERSON3) That's yes, that is... like I thought that I also had, but I don't know either of the venues. They have final paper registration in July. So, the conference was in September, and the paper submission was in May.
Because for Interspeech, we could also like split it paper by paper. So that some papers would go to the Interspeech proceedings. And some of our submission papers would come later for the PBML proceedings. And the authors would be free to choose. So that we have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech. If it is okay for them to have some of our papers, given that these papers are submitted by the March deadline. So, there is an absolute strict requirement. And I think it's they cannot have anything against it. Because if the paper is worth publishing. Like, it's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event. So yeah, I think it's okay. So, we do not need to ask for a special session. In Interspeech it is called special session, we don't want that. In Interspeech we want the satellite event. But we will tell our people. If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech. Ah, if you do not, ah, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline. And that is for PBML.
(PERSON7) Ah, okay. But the thing is like for Interspeech satellite event. Erm, Interspeech like won't get into any proceedings.
(PERSON2) You can I think you can just you can just reserve the whole semester just for [PERSON9]'s courses and you will have a lot of work and no free time, even though you have just one subject. But I think it's a different thing, because I think it's not really a thing to fail his courses. Like to fail because you are unable to finish it. Of course, like people are just giving up, but I mean it's maybe for different reason that just it's impossible to pass. I think that it's definitely possible, but it's a lot of work.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I think that he told us in the beginning of the semester that well if we want a one (??) you'll get a one. Just within the second deadline, you should submit it. That's pretty much the only thing he asked. But he also told us that judging by previous years' trends, a lot of people don't do that. They find it easier to read for the exam. No, sorry, study for the exam-
(PERSON2) Yeah because well in general, his exams are rather easy.
(PERSON2) So I wouldn't say it's super easy, because there are some courses where the exam is like fun.
(PERSON1) Oh well, one of them was yesterday for me.
(PERSON2) Yeah, when it has short context and because I make decisions based on very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that in, for example, a second or two, it figures out oh, well, actually this was bad translation. So, it tries to use a different wording. To, for example, specify the thing. So actually, I really liked it. I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, even though you could see that the model made mistakes on its first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction. And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is also important. If you really demand low latency, then then I think that even a slightly lower quality is fine, if the fluency is good. Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think that the translation is just pointless. But if the lower quality is because the translation, if you read everything that you will get the same information, but the wording is just poor, because it used, for example, more words and it used some corrections and stuff. So, I think that this is completely fine for simultaneous, as long as you don't lose any information. And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples? Because I would like to look at it, just out of curiosity.
(PERSON2) Oh definitely, I can dump you my logs.
(PERSON7) But in which languages? Because you know I don't speak German.
(PERSON2) English and German.
(PERSON7) Yeah, but I don't necessarily speak German <laugh/>.
(PERSON2) Then I can provide English–Chinese and English–Japanese if it helps <laugh/>.
(PERSON2) So again, I mean to make it humanly readable. Because this flickering is really annoying and then you lose focus on what was actually said, because maybe this is also a question of someone who knows more about the human brain and how we work with information. Sorry, I never thought about it in depth. But I think that whenever I see a word, I put it into my memory and my memory is not a linear thing, but it's more like a bag. So, I put a word into a bag. And I like to connect the things in the bag to get the overall image of the word. And I think that that's the problem with the flicker. If you translate something and then you change it, then actually I read it already, it's in my brain. And then I lose focus and control of what was actually then translated as correct and was not what was not. So that's why I think that the whole flicker thing is bad and stupid by definition. Like I see the motivation, like you want to display everything you have. Even though you cannot promise it's good. But I think that we cannot work with this extra information. And I think that maybe the problem is that the systems are created by people working with it. If I'm a developing a system, then I'm really crazy happy if I see that even if I don't promise the translation is correct, I still show it and it's somehow good, but I think that the developer is not really focusing on the content itself. And how you perceive the content, but rather that, oh yeah, my system can output it really quickly. And even though it just guesses the quality is okay-ish, I think maybe that's why the retranslation was created. Just the developers of the systems are eager to display information, and I think that because we are limited in in like the vol e of information we can perceive some time, we like see the extra information is just an extra burden for us. So, I think that it's not good to show extra. Like if you want to decrease latency, then instead of flicker, just lower the quality. I think that's still better than showing the flicker. Because what would be the real use case? Why would you need to see the unstable hypothesis, really? Like from a user perspective?
(PERSON1) Like technically, when human translators start translating, I mean the goal even there is for annotators, they would try to follow the speech string of the original speaker. So, there are times when they would say something, and that would be wrong, so they would just correct themselves.
(PERSON2) Well but yeah this means with my solution, like you would not do flicker, but you committed, like there is no way to change, but you correct yourself. And that's actually what the translators are doing.
(PERSON3) I'm strongly feeling that our work is not exactly in the domain of speech, it is unhealthy. Because there is no concept of speech here. We are directly working on text. But the thing is that the proposal for a statistical workshop this year is over, which was in September, which was too early for us. And the next proposal would come for 2022, which would be too late for us. It is better that if we get either of the two sectile or interspeech, because both of them are well recognized in the community. We can motivate participants to submit. Ah, the only the only caveat that I'm finding now is going with interspeech is like they won't allow us a space in the proceedings, which may deter some of the participants, I am not sure how much they will be excited to publish a paper in archive. So, in archives, people can publish any time, right? So that is not a benefit to their profiles. So how to motivate participants to join our shared task. So, this was the reason that I especially vouched for the special session. But this time, the problem is, what I can understand is the last time, the time periods between proposals, submission and final paper submission was five months, so it would have been enough time for our schedule, but this time. It is only three months.
So, I see this fair as an important possible source of non-native English speech that we can use to extend the test set. So, I think we really should focus on the Clearest voice competition, and we can do the booth if we have to. But I would like to limit that, because the dissemination into high school students is less of an impact for us. It is more important to use it as a test session. So, we should focus, [PERSON1], on the [PROJECT2] Clearest voice, and keeping the organizers happy so that we can do the data gathering there. And do whatever they want us to do in exchange for that, and we need to check their plenary program, and what type of subtitling would be useful for that plenary program. so that would make it a test session for us, and as for our own presence at this fair, I don't think it's too important. So, if we are asked, if we are really expected to be there and present, then okay, but if not, then I think it's definitely good for us just to be behind the curtain and behind the scenes and do our job there.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I haven't tried to do the registration yet for that, but I think that last time, it was compulsory to have the booth.
(PERSON2) Yes. So, discuss with them what is needed so that they are happy, and they allow us to do the Clearest voice, which is the most important thing. The test session is less of an urge. And the booth is just something that we really could avoid, if possible.
I would have preferred them to join the sessions earlier than doing things like that. So, we really need to practice these preparations. With the online world, it seems that you simply j p into the session, and the work is done. But that is not the case. It always takes 30 minutes to get it running and properly connected. So, we need to be there earlier. And if some session that we are doing starts at nine, but the organizers meet at a quarter to nine. Then we have to come at a quarter past eight already, so that we have the 30 minutes extra to make sure that everything is running and chase people. So, this is a remark for everybody that for the management to work, please also anticipate what management might suddenly ask you to do, and that would help a little. Another message that is very important is the recording of these important sessions. I don't know if you have responded, I had not seen anyone providing any- any updates to the document. Maybe I forgot to tell all of you. I had a document about the experience from [PROJECT4]and [PROJECT5] 2020. And the first point in this experience is that we were very bad at recording these sessions. So, it's important for the purposes of further evaluation or analysis of what went wrong to have good recordings of these sessions. And one aspect is to get the consents, to actually be allowed to do the recording. And even if we try to get the consents in retrospect or whatever. Then there is the technical aspect of the- of the recording. And we have seen that this is so diverse and complex. Yeah, [PERSON5] is sending that link. I have sent it by email, I remember.
2 bad lemons in a row :( I ordered from this company because I've bought it previous seasons and it worked great for us. This season I bought the next size I needed. One of the pajamas I received had a hole on the foot of the pajama. I returned it and the company sent me a new one. The replacement pajama my son wore one time, I put it in my washing machine just like always and the zipper broke off! I'm so disappointed because I don't have time to be dealing with returns every few days and yet that is what is happening right now.
Just as described
This is a basic puffer coat. If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations. The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to "puff up" a bit. I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me. I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign. However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent). Overall, I am pleased. The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.
This is a very nice skirt. The lacy pattern is classy and soft
This is a very nice skirt. The lacy pattern is classy and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool. This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into. I think this could be flattering on anyone. I'm 5'5" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down.
Didn't work with my 1999 Buick LeSabre
Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed. However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car. The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob. This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it. There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.
Good Price for Replacement
The grill of my car was ripped off by a large something flying down the interstate so I needed a replacement. I was afraid after reading some reviews that this wouldn't fit, but it was perfect! I own a 2013 Corolla LE. I didn't put it on myself--I had a guy at a body shop do it for me--but it looked really easy. It just snapped right on in less than 5 minutes. I gave it a 4 star for the sturdiness because it does seem pretty flimsy (time and flying debris will tell), but over all I'm very satisfied that my car no longer has a gaping maw on the front now and that the price was reasonable.
Needs improvement
Super awesome light My 5 year old absolutely loved this light It didn’t last long he got it for his birthday in January it’s February already has trouble with the buttons and doesn’t run bright with plug in eats up batteries even tried recharging batteries Super cool but needs improvement
Musical Start
The piano is great starters! It finds your child’s inner artistic ability and musical talent. It develops a good hand-eye coordination. The piano isn’t only a play toy, but it actually works and allows your child to play music at an early age. If you want your child to be a future pianist, you should try this product out! Very worth the money!
I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes. The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw. I was pretty taken aback. I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago. Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week. My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.
Someone screwed up the formula?? This is so weird. In normal light it looks like I have a pink and an orange but under UV light they are the same! I drew a pink line using a paint stick from another brand so you can see what pink should look like and know it's not just my camera. Pink is my most used color so I'm a bit upset about this. Red, orange, and pink are basically all orange. No point in calling them red or pink. The white isn't as bright as I would have hoped. The rest of the colors are all great and I like how easily these paints wash off. I just wits there were a pink. I guess the purple will suffice.
works for the most part
I had bleached my whole head and then dyed over it with a black box dye a few months ago. I then went and had highlights put in all over my head. A few weeks later I put blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye on my hair and it would not fade out. I used this stuff with Olaplex No. 3 and it lightened TREMENDOUSLY all over, removing the green and blue parts as well as lifting the dark box dye. However, after a day I noticed a green tint to my hair. Every day it gets worse and I have used the color extractor twice now, with the same results. My hair is also getting darker where the box dye was. This is a great product it just doesn't seem to last.
don't believe the hype
Too many five-star reviews on this novel need to be tempered by some more realistic assessments. I tried reading it but I just found the language flat. the "freshwater" metaphor and the many descriptions of the womb like a river and the baby like a fish seemed forced, hackneyed, and contrived. I skipped ahead and it looked like all I was going to find was a campus drama.
I give this book 10 stars! Excellent read!! I absolutely loved the book!! I’ve adopted 4 Siamese cats from Siri over the years and everyone of them were absolute loves. Once you start to read this book, it’s hard to put down. Funny, witty and very entertaining!! Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!
I really Like this ring light! It is wonderful for the price and it gets the job done! The only issue is the light bulb heats up too fast and the light goes out, so I have to turn it off wait for a while then turn it back on. I don't think that is supposed to happen...I don't know if I have a defective light or what, but it is a very nice ring light besides the overheating.
Confusing storyline
The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot. Also the title doesn’t fit the story. The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened. I was confused at times and had to go back and re read a lot to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
Loved Collins... It took a while to warm up to Grady
3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.
He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors. Regarding his portrayal of Churchill
Mr. Oldman has played and created many, different characters. It is very difficult to tell it is him. He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors. Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done. The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages... The scenery and costumes were excellent. Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position. Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times
Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth! I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.
Good, but would like to find something better
After a lot of research, I started using this product many years ago. It had the least amount of harmful ingredients, and still worked okay. However, it dries up so quickly that you end up using so much lube, which ends up costing a lot of money, as well as being too disruptive during sex. I've just been too lazy to look for a new product, but will start looking for one that is both harmless, works well, and not too costly.
The battery life is terrible on the one I bought on Amazon. Still can’t believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else comes close in comparison. I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my 4th one. Dog chewed up the first one, husband kneeled on the screen of the second one, and the third ones still working but there’s an elbow mark in the middle of the touch screen also courtesy of the hubby...bought this one as a back up and the screens great but the battery it came with holds a charge maybe for a couple days. My original (3rd one) keeps a charge for weeks at a time and I use my remote for everything.
Broke in less than a week
I like the product it’s a nice size and color! Unfortunately only had it a week and opened the one door and it cracked the top of the wood piece! I’m really disappointed! It’s all assembled and I don’t have the box anymore so how could I even think about sending it back?! My husband did try and fix it with wood glue but sadly that didn’t work either! The door popped right out again!!
Not too easy to assemble plus.... It’s a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult. Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked. I had to go out and purchase corner brackets to make sure they stayed together. Also the glass panel doors are out of line and don’t match evenly. This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line. Still haven’t figured out to align them.
BAD CODE PRINTED ON THE TOP OF THE POD
I purchased these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem. Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine. It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing since my return window has expired. UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money. Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!
Sweetener on the go. Such a convenience! It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets! I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend’s house. While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea. Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!
Doesn't actually do any air "cleaning" Bought this as a humidifier, the "air cleaning" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.
I guess it was easier to break than they thought. I am giving this product a 3 star do to the fact when I got it in it was broken already inside. Once I examined it I realized whoever put it in the box put it in there broken, This could have either been the manufacturers packers or for the manufacturers sake the problem could possibly be that a buyer returned the item and claimed they just didn't want it or didn't need it and Amazon possibly did not do a good enough quality check when it came back. In all fairness the buyer couldn't have said it was broken because then Amazon wouldn't have taken it back which is good especially with this kind of product either way though I am the one who got stuck with someones negligence. I did however get my money back so after thinking about it and discussing it with my spouse I have decided to give this buyer another chance. With that said I will only update my rating to a higher star depending on how customer service handles this post (by at least addressing it) and if the item comes in great shape, actually has the opportunity to do what it does, and works well doing what it is supposed to do.
Easy to install????? Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install. I tried installing both "bells" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how "weatherproof" it is. I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.
Lost package - Re-Charged me
Grew up with these and was psyched to purchase them for my son, but they lost the package of live caterpillars. They told me they'd replace it and charge half the shipping this time. After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount. I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher. I spent 30 minutes on the phone so I caved and just bought another set of caterpillars. Whatever.
Works well after some headaches. Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery. When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC. Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info. PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case). The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth. Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.
... was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold
I asked the seller if the color was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold, darker. Nothing close! The set looks VERY cheap. It's super shiny yellow with lots of CZs, even shinier. Looks great on the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :( This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable! The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me. :( Too bad because I really did love it! So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!! You won't be disappointed!
buy the Pampered Chef... I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage. I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies. I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products. Not this one. At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working. I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat. So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop. It's totally worth it!
Will not buy Mr. Coffee again
It was a fine coffee maker for a while, but there were always issues with it. If you got water between the black plastic and metal on the carafe, it would leak and drain the water for days. Then our plastic lever broke which allows the coffee to flow through the filter and into the carafe. I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house. It's great at making coffee and keeping it hot, but there are too many other issues with it to invest in it at the current price.
Must buy!! I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great! The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain. I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars! It was easy to clean and all came in wrapped individually which I found to be really organised and it calmed my soul lol love, love, LOVE the color and I would definitely buy this again for myself or for a loved one!
Might be good on a pole, but NOT as a hanging baffle or weather shield. Shame on Audubon. The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and "Make sure it is securely in place." HOW??? It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind. You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it. It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug. It is a complete PITA. I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards. (Let's face it; there's nothing like this which will actually "baffle" squirrels!)
I love many of the features of these lights
I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants. I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only. I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself. I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants. The lights are small! When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.
BEWARE...SMELL IS VERY BAD...CARD SLOTS TOO BIG! When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD. At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell. It never went away, so I had to return it. PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big. The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out. THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.
It’s very small.. Received the travel money belt and it a lot smaller than the pictures shows. I wished I did not buy it and will still have to look for something larger.
Good umbrella, would buy it again if I had to
First off, I have to say the color is loveeeee. A lot of things I order in purple always come too light, too kiddish, too weird, too neon-ish, what have you. But this purple was deep and lush and I love it, the umbrella is sturdy and really good quality. Probably best umbrella I’ve had. Comes with a cover and while it may not have much functional use, it really keeps it looking sharp.
Packaging is terrible - received 3 damaged guitars
Very nice looking guitar. Too bad the company does not know how to protect their product. Don’t bother trying to receive one that is not damaged. We returned 2 because of damages in shipping and the the 3rd one was damaged also. Gave up. They ship it in the soft thin case with one sheet of brown paper in a cardboard box. No padding at all.
Cool concept! Just needs some more improvements to make it a really awesome product
Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.
Ribbed off by Vision Supplies
October 2017 purchased four (4) cartridges from Vision Supplies - Amazon Marketplace, so I would have when needed and to save shipping cost. Used two over the last couple of years, about one a year, and they worked okay. Tried to use one last week, almost empty after printing 20 labels, but in last one ran out after 40 pages. The plastic a missing on both. Told warranty expired!!!! Who would check every single cartridge when received???? BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry, what? My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk. I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable. You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell? Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this. You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries. I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough. I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.
Drops internet
I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I’ve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It’s fantastic. I’v Had it for over a week with no problems. It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router. Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.
but it happens enough to be annoying. On a positive note
1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box. The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on. Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point. The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times... They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying. On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Ok case with serious limitations
This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max. The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen. Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues. The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand. The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments. I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation. This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy. Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen. The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen. This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees. This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand. This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.
Everything I needed
This product is really slick - one stop shopping for all my connectivity needs. I love just throwing this and my laptops tiny power adapter in my go bag and being prepared to work on a big 4k display or grab photos from my camera. The only odd thing I experienced (and I’ve experienced this on all 4 usb-c hubs I’ve tried from different brands) is that mac’s apparently can’t tell the difference between multiples of the same monitor (so my mac outputs the same video to all identical monitors connected to the hub whether by HDMI and/or VGA). But if I use 2 separate hubs/adapters or 2 different models of monitor then the mac properly outputs to the displays individually.
Ok, needs some improvement. A decent training tool but it really needs to have some sort of Safety Lock over the shock button( been pressed more on accident when it's in my pocket then I've actually intended to use it) my dogs even accidentally zapped herself after stepping on the remote. Also if your dog likes to roll around in raccoon poop like mine does it is such a pain in the butt to clean. As the fecal matter gets in between the cracks of the device requiring you to disassemble the entire thing to clean it properly and get the smell out. Also the range is a bit inconsistent. I've noticed you almost need line of sight for it to work. And there have been times where it has not functioned at all even though I'm only 30 feet away from my dog. Being rechargeable is certainly a nice feature and the charge does last for a good while. I only need to charge mine about once every two weeks.
You get what you pay for. Horrible product, misrepresented
I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it. First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual. Second, it doesn't come with a charger. Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer. Fine, we have lots of those around. When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out. I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges. Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed. Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning. I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later. Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...
Great backpack but overkill on the straps
This backpack looks good and performs well. It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days. The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps. There’s more straps on this bag than I can count. I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag. Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college. There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided. The flag also is a great finish to it
My dog hasnt destroyed it yet
Have had probs with Hockey Balls. My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float. That is until she chews them to bits. Tried several, even the "hot weather" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others. Until these showed up. These have stood the test. My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews. Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog. Thumbs up from Daisy and I.
This product is hazardous to children. This is a huge health hazard to your baby. We checked the battery after a couple weeks of use and saw that water went into the compartment where the batteries go. The batteries themselves had rotted and a black liquid was coming out of them. Looking at the design, it appears that theres no way the battery enclosure could be waterproof meaning not only did water go into the compartment during bathtime, some of that toxic material came out as well. Please do not buy this product. I’m shocked that it was allowed to go to market despite such an obvious flaw.
overheating issues and hard time connecting controller
Im giving it 3 stars for now, i don't want leave a bad review for the seller unless he deserves it but this drone overheats a lot. Im not sure if i should contact the seller or dji tello themselves but ill probably try both just to see what they say. I like the drone is a cool little toy that fly's better than some bigger older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one. However its the only drone i have ever had overheating issues with and it actually takes the fun out of flying im going to assume for now that its a manufacturing issue which they need to address asap if they want there product to be successful. I really hope the seller did not send me a use drone as i paid for a new one. I will give the sellers props for delivery as it arrive 1 day after purchase. I will update date my review after contacting seller and dji tello.
I only have good things to say about this gift bag set
I only have good things to say about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all of my Christmas gifts with the bags, gift wrap and tissue paper. The product is great quality and the different size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for every gift! I highly recommend it. The seller is absolutely sweet and attentive. He reached out to me after my purchase to make sure I was happy with my product. 5 stars all the way around!
The physics are terrible and the people that created the game won't do anything about it
Don't buy this game the physics are terrible and I am so mad at this game because probably there are about 40 hackers on every single game and the game. Don't doesn't even do anything about it you know they just let the hackers do whatever they want and then they do know that the game is terrible but they're doing absolutely nothing about it and the game keeps on doing updates about their characters really what they should be updating is the physics because it's terrible don't buy this game the physics are terrible and mechanics are terrible the people that obviously the people that built this game was high or something because it's one of the worst games I've honestly ever played in my life I would rather play Pixel Games in this crap it's one of the worst games don't buy
Not like other tomb raider games
From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games. Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren’t smart in knowing what direction you’re trying to take. Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways. Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense. I have not enjoyed this game. I do not plan on finishing it. The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.
Ergonomic and affordable, but not very tolerant of constant use
It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller. The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker. 2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly. We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year. So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase. The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls.
You get what you pay for
I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic. It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me. I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it. I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that. However, it you can overlook that, then it might be right for you. It was packaged well and did arrive quickly.
Nothing like the previous Stylo phones, MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus. Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it. Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and "in the loop" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone. Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST. On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.
And he says, "We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments." And he's an economist, so he's rational. And he says —
And the source was a man, an African-American man, charming, rugged, homeless, playing a violin that only had two strings.
And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Steve's columns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown, and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
I mean, I'm a journalist. We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.
That guy in the middle, not so much.
And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let's call him Lex Luther — got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds.
Well, I was next.
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis.
Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, "Amanda, you'll never walk again." And that was 19 yeas ago.
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story. "See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie — and there he is giving me the look he often gave me — he would say," Son, there's three sides to every story.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me — and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years — I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy.
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there — I'm like, "All right, here's the deal: Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome."
And he's seriously one of the funniest — I call him Yoda, because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing."
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage, and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.
I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen.
That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
Now when I was a freshman in college, I took my first biology class.
And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear — that means I found a few things.
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate — or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate — for people who are patients of doctors.
Most females like me — I believe myself to be a typical female — I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up, but I think I'm probably typical — most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
The consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy, and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.

And he was born looking like a boy — nobody suspected anything.
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity; what it means to be a black person is, allegedly, to have an African anatomy in terms of your history.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
Henry can marry, in every state, a woman, but Mary can only marry today in a few states, a woman.
So for example, Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome, and what it means to marry a woman means you have a Y chromosome.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with — a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like, if we had more involved the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism — I considered myself a feminist, as I still do, asked a really strange question.
And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.
Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
And I asked last week, in a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack.
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager, and I asked the manager, "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?" And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday, with cameras ready usually.
And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me.
I was an obsessive compulsive student.
I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself.
Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident.
And at about the nine day mark, they let her go — Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother.
And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.
Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
And she said the three words: Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?" Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.
I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins." And I turn around, and it's this older man.
This man was Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day, because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.
This man was Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day, because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation, so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago.
Imagine the first piece: a man burning his life's work.
He is a poet, a playwright, a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom.
My grandmother never let me forget his life.
My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died — already in an arranged marriage, already with two small girls.
If we were captured, first my sister and I, then she and my grandmother would drink.
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
And for that work, when I was a final-year law student, I was chosen as the Young Australian of the Year.
I told my mother I couldn't do it.
Before I close, though, let me tell you about my grandmother.
At 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her.
At 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her.
With no support from her husband, she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case, and a far greater sensation when she won. "It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.
My mother phoned minutes later.
My mother asked us to feel her hand.
She asked the monk, "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?" "Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said. "You have not let it go."
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested.
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.
I grew up in a house that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch, and that matriarch was my grandmother.
She was tough, she was strong, she was powerful.
She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
When I would see her as a little boy, she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs.
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
And my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me.
I grew up in the country in the rural South, and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.
I grew up in the country in the rural South, and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.
When I was about 14 or 15, one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer — I don't know where he got it — and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods.
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did.
And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some, and they offered it to me.
Y'all go ahead. "And then my brother started staring at me.
When I thought about my grandmother, of course she would think all her grandkids were special.
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.
And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse, there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in. He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?" I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me, almost at counsel table.
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?" And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
But one fellow in particular, a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things.
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
Well, as a reporter, if I hang a microphone on someone, that is consent.
Do we have women as victims, and are men only the perpetrators?
I will continue to work as a researcher and a reporter in developing countries, but I do it with an altered ethic of seeing.
I'm a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, part of the Opera of the Future group, and my research focuses on the relationship people have with their own voice and with the voices of others.
But maybe the reason that my Twitter critic wasn't happy with that idea is because he doesn't agree with my definition of justice. Fair enough. Maybe he and I don't see eye to eye, politically.
As a scientist, I have access to high-tech equipment that we can put over the side of the research vessel, and it measures oxygen and many more things.
What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall," how much would you know about his height?
I'm a scientist. I don't know if you could tell that.
But I truly believe that, as a scientist, using mostly federal funds to do the research, I owe it to the public, to agency heads and congressional people to share my knowledge with them so they can use it, hopefully to make better decisions about our environmental policy.
He cofounded a company called Deaftronics, which now manufactures the Solar Ear, which is a hearing aid powered by his invention.
Having completed the course, the student fed back to us that he now realized that it was he who hadn't understood what the client wanted.
Another student gave us feedback that she had learned to design with empathy, as opposed to designing for functionality, which is what her engineering education had taught her.
Pakistan is also the birthplace of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai.
Another aspect is where the twisted concept of honor is linked to women and their bodies; where men are allowed to disrespect women and even kill them sometimes in the name of so-called "family honor"; where women are left to die right outside their houses for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, in the name of "family honor." Let me say this very clearly: it's not honor; it's a cold-blooded murder.
However, unlike the other male guardians of my family, my father was one who really supported my ambitions.
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he really didn't approve of this and threw me out of his house, along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah.
My father told me he was not happy about me writing a book that risked deportation and unemployment.
He had been diabetic for many years when I still worked in Dubai, and my salary was always sufficient to pay for his treatments.
I called my mother. "I'm OK." I called my husband. "I'm OK." Then my daughter called, my voice cracked, and I knew I had to pull myself together.
And as a history teacher, I knew I needed to start with the Second Amendment and the NRA.
So Amos was an example of a male who was liked as a leader, and I think the term alpha male, if you look it up on the internet, you will find all these business books that tell you how to be an alpha male, and what they mean is how to beat up others and beat them over the head and let them know that you are boss and don't mess with me and so on.
Just as an example, the three males that I used to work with most at the Dutch zoo long ago, where I worked, and the middle male here is a 17-year-old alpha male.
The male whom he is grooming on the side is twice as old, and this old male has made him the leader.
So you can imagine that that old male has an enormous amount of power, because he has made the alpha male alpha male.
You don't need to be the biggest and strongest male.
The smallest male, if he has the right friends and keeps them happy, or he has female support, he can be the alpha male.
But she of course didn't need to send the message that she could hold a baby without dropping it, which was what the man was doing.
If you don't do that, that old male is going to get mad at you, and you're going to lose him as a partner.
The one in the back puts her arms around her and consoles her.
But I do want to emphasize that the alpha in a group doesn't need to be a male, and that actually in one of our close relatives, it is a female.
When spring arrived, I ran so fast through the house, speeding ahead of my mother's voice.
When spring arrived, I ran so fast through the house, speeding ahead of my mother's voice.
I pulled on my red corduroy jumper and my grey plaid wool hat before my mother could get her jacket on.
My mother cooked with the colors and textures of her garden.
I'm a woman of super strong opinions, with really deep convictions, direct speech.
I'm not an engineer. I did not study engineering in school.
But I was a super ambitious student growing up.
Here's an email I sent to my brother around that time. "You won't understand how difficult it is for me to tell you, to confess this.
So as an inventor, I'm interested in things that people struggle with.
Nearly every apartment in and around my grandmother's place now has an air conditioner.
So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15.
I have a grown daughter who's brilliant and happy and wonderful.
I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo, New York, right across the border from where we live.
I have this — not a scientist myself — but an uncanny ability to understand everything about science, except the actual science —
The best we can be is like the old woman in that joke — I don't know if you've heard it.
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything that makes it sound like, "You're too old to drive," so she didn't say anything.
But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking.
A dictator may not be able to provide me with good health care, but he will be able to make me love him and to make me hate the opposition.
Jim Ewing: The morning after the first time I was attached to the robot, my daughter came downstairs and asked me how it felt to be a cyborg, and my answer was that I didn't feel like a cyborg.
In reality, Galina's husband was an active pro-Russia militant in Donbass.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while." And so, we started planning these expeditions.
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher, and he said to me, "John, it almost doesn't matter what you know.
So here's a classic video from the 1970s of professor Andy Grove.
I quickly held out my hands and said to his shaking mother in Arabic,
This is why my wife and I and friends co-founded "Humanity Crew." One of the few aid organizations in the world that specializes in providing psychosocial aid and first-response mental health interventions to refugees and displaced populations.
She kissed her daughter goodbye, left her home, never to return.
He did not want to be a farmer.
He borrowed a very old motorcycle, with tires that were more patches than tires, to become a motorcycle taxi driver.
Fast-forward three years, Saminu has earned enough money to buy three goats for his mother to start a goat-rearing business, owns his own retail store and bought not one, but two motorcycles, with vanity license plates: "Babban Gona."
So as a designer, it's absolutely key to have a good understanding of the visual and cultural vocabulary of your audience.
Fortunately, my daughter was born at 11: 30 —
My father had passed away, and I never had a chance to tell him I loved him.
My mother had dementia and no longer recognized me, and my children had grown up.
I moved closer to my mother, my wife usually travels with me, and when my kids have vacation, if they don't come home, I go to them.
My main sport was soccer, and I was a goalkeeper, which is both the best and the worst position on the field.
When you're a goalie, all eyes are on you, and with that comes the pressure.
So imagine that grave day, when her sassy supervisor invited her to this "change everything" meeting and told her that would have to ask each and every last one of her patients to self-identify.
And she ended her rant by saying that her sassy supervisor invited her to this "change everything" meeting and didn't, didn't, even, even bring, bring food, food, food, food.
I fell out of love with this fish. No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two shoes foodie.
I mean, I literally could have been a woman who was scheduled to do a TED Talk and would use her as an example. Imagine that.
Now, I'm an artist.
I had returned home to live in Dublin after the odyssey that was my 20s, educating my interest in human rights and equality in university, traveling the world, like my nomad grandmother.
Let's call him Miguel — actually his name is Miguel. And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef, at least in the way that you and I understand it.
He's a biologist at Veta La Palma.
As a storyteller, I've always been fascinated with the idea of recreating this notion of choices in fiction.
So, as a child, I used to spend all of my time at my great-grandmother's house.
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish.
Prisoner two also sees an odd number of black hats, so she knows hers is white, and answers correctly.
Prisoner four hears that and knows that she should be looking for an even number of black hats since one was behind her.
I'm a self-taught cellist, I've never had a lesson.
But my mom was an inspiration to me.
She's also one of the most extraordinary people I know, beyond being a wonderful musician.
You see, I tell everyone that I am a haunted person.
Once my daughter was watching me return some of those packages back, and she said, "Mom, I think you have a problem."
I want to leave my daughter and my daughter's daughter a better and cleaner place than I found it, so I have not only stopped overordering, I recycle religiously as well.
For women under the age of 30, that number looks like one in 10.
I was the navigator on board, and one evening, after a long session analyzing weather data and plotting our course, I came up on deck and saw this beautiful sunset.
So, the story actually begins in 2005, in an office high above Sunset Boulevard, where I was a junior executive at Leonardo DiCaprio's production company Appian Way.
For example, a comedy about a high school senior, who, when faced with an unplanned pregnancy, makes an unusual decision regarding her unborn child.
Now, I'm an accelerator physicist, so I design particle accelerators, and I try and understand how beams behave.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing.
Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can "solve the climate crisis." But the climate crisis has already been solved.
I really always wanted to be an HR professional, I wanted to be able to speak the language of management.
If you're queasy — if you faint easily — I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost passed out.
So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student.
While all living elements — the birds, animals and plants, forests, fisheries etc.— are biotic elements, abiotic elements include air, water, land etc.
A study of the environment then calls for a study of the inter-relationship between these biotic and abiotic components of the environment.
It is caused by man-made increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases through the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.
To make matters worse, global environmental issues such as global warming and ozone depletion also contribute to increased financial commitments for the government.
As a result of depletion of the ozone layer, more ultraviolet (UV) radiation comes to Earth and causes damage to living organisms.
UV radiation seems responsible for skin cancer in humans; it also lowers production of phytoplankton and thus affects other aquatic organisms.
The black soil of the Deccan Plateau is particularly suitable for cultivation of cotton, leading to concentration of textile industries in this region.
India’s forests, though unevenly distributed, provide green cover for a majority of its population and natural cover for its wildlife.
It includes all the biotic and abiotic factors that influence each other.
Rocks and sunlight are examples of abiotic elements of the environment.
Much of the recent observed and projected global warming is human-induced.
Hence the expenditure on health is also rising.
The biggest question that arises is: are environmental problems new to this century?
Some of the longer-term results of global warming are melting of polar ice with a resulting rise in sea level and coastal flooding; disruption of drinking water supplies dependent on snow melts; extinction of species as ecological niches disappear; more frequent tropical storms; and an increased incidence of tropical diseases.
This led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol banning the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compounds, as well as other ozone depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethane (also known as methyl chloroform), and bromine compounds known as halons.
Environment is defined as the total planetary inheritance and the totality of all resources.
Ozone depletion refers to the phenomenon of reductions in the amount of ozone in the stratosphere.
The problem of ozone depletion is caused by high levels of chlorine and bromine compounds in the stratosphere.
A reduction of approximately 5 per cent in the ozone layer was detected from 1979 to 1990.
Large deposits of iron-ore, coal and natural gas are found in the country.
India accounts for nearly 8 per cent of the world’s total iron-ore reserves.
water and air pollution, the government set up the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 1974.
This was followed by states establishing their own state level boards to address all the environmental concerns.
Global warming is a gradual increase in the average temperature of the earth’s lower atmosphere as a result of the increase in greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution.
Adding carbon dioxide, methane and such other gases (that have the potential to absorb heat) to the atmosphere with no other changes will make our planet’s surface warmer.
In the early days when civilisation just began, or before this phenomenal increase in population, and before countries took to industrialisation, the demand for environmental resources and services was much less than their supply.
The origins of these compounds are chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), used as cooling substances in air-conditioners and refrigerators, or as aerosol propellants, and bromofluorocarbons (halons), used in fire extinguishers.
Heavy metal pollution continues to be a serious problem in the environment due to uncontrolled pesticide use, mining, foundry operations, smelting, fossil fuel burning and sewage sludge dumping.
Mercury, lead, chromium, cadmium, copper and other heavy metals are non-biodegradable and remain in the environment in regions where human activity is prevalent.
In this study, the International Guidelines for Preventing Oils Spills and Response to Disasters were reviewed and the characteristics of oil spills were discussed.
The primary objectives of response to oil spill are: to prevent the spill from moving onto shore, reduce the impact on marine life and speed the degradation of any unrecovered oil.
A comparative analysis were performed on the currently available remediation technologies using 10 evaluation criteria that included cost, efficiency, time, impact on wild life, reliability, level of difficulty, oil recovery, weather, effect on physical/chemical characteristics of oil and the need for further treatment.
Even at low doses, these metals are toxic and can affect the food chain, posing serious public health risks.
Oil spills are environmental disasters that impact human, plants and wild life including birds, fish and mammals.
The advantages and disadvantages of each response method were used to determine the score assigned to that method.
Heavy metal contamination is a serious hazard to all biota in the ecosystem because of its devastating consequences and their accumulation in soil and water has significant implications for food safety and security, the growth of plants and the survival of soil microorganisms that play significant roles in sustaining agricultural crop production.
Anthropogenic activities pollute the oceans with oil through land run off, vessels accidents, periodic tanker discharges and bilge discharges.
Was Earth bombarded on that terrible day by more than one space rock?
The dinosaurs couldn't ride out the climate shock.
By comparison, the effects from a Nadir-sized impactor would have been much, much smaller.
Chicxulub would have been 10 million times greater.
Dr Nicholson's team has to be cautious about tying the two impacts together.
Its age is not too dissimilar.
The Nadir Crater feature is reported in the journal Science Advances.
Chemical reactions produce a dull brown mineral called spheniscidite.
It's unique and reflects the special conditions that exist only in that locality.
All of Earth's rocks are built from different aggregations.
Robert Hazen: "An epic story that spans more than 4.5 billion years"
Water, they say, has helped more than 80% of mineral species to form.
One-third of mineral species formed exclusively through biological processes.
"Life affects minerals in various ways," explained Dr Hazen.
"For example, photosynthesis produces oxygen.
But of course, life also creates its own minerals, biominerals.
That's 5,659 in the IMA catalogue.
Some minerals are extraordinarily ancient; 296 are even thought to pre-date Earth itself.
Of this number, 97 are known only from meteorites.
These can include mineral grains with ages estimated at up to seven billion years.
That's long before our Solar System existed.
"We're looking at the mineralogy of Mars," said Dr Hazen.
"We're constantly looking for evidence in the minerals that might point to life.
Scientists have been front and centre in the battle against coronavirus.
The role of science has traditionally been reserved for enabling developments.
Science that understands people and communities must be part of the conversation.
But good science is just the first step.
But it doesn't end there.
This may sound straightforward and maybe even quite reasonable.
Global challenges transcend governments, international boundaries, leadership boards, short-term agendas and traditional siloes.
This leaves us with another question - could this really be feasible?
This can and should happen in more settings, large and small.
Conversations are key.
As we face these challenges, global leaders need science.
Watch USV Maxlimer as it moves through waters around Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha’apai
Everything is done over satellite link.
"We can communicate with nearby vessels via radio as if we were on board"
So every switch, every function on the boat, every light, we can control from here."
Robotic, remotely controlled boats are likely to be the future of maritime operations.
There are also environmental benefits to USVs.
The atmospheric shockwave caused by the eruption was felt as far away as the UK.
Weather satellites captured the climactic eruption.
Video looped three times.
The specimen was identified by prolific West Country fossil-hunters Neville and Sally Hollingworth.
"We've got the whole food chain," palaeontologist Dean Lomax, from Manchester, said.
"So this Pachycormus would have been eating the smaller fish and squids.
"And then, the ichthyosaurs would have been eating the Pachycormus."
Play with a 3D model of Pachycormus here.
The finds are likely to keep researchers busy for a number of years.
"The Court Farm site allows scientists to do modern research with fresh, in-situ material."
The Hollingworths are celebrated for their extraordinary ability to identify highly productive fossil locations.
This is a volume equivalent to something approaching 4,000 Egyptian pyramids.
Weather satellites captured the eruption.
WATCH: Scientists have modelled how the density currents would have run out across the seafloor
"Where you had these flows, there is nothing living there today.
It's like a desert 70km from the volcano," Dr Mackay said.
The pyroclastic flows also have a part in the tsunami story of Hunga-Tonga.
LISTEN: Dr Kevin Mackay describes what's been learnt at Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Haʻapai
At certain phases during the eruption, these mechanisms likely worked in tandem.
This occurred just over 45 minutes after the first major eruptive blast.
"We had a huge pressure anomaly that on its own would have generated a tsunami.
So, when you've already got waves, then you're just adding energy to them."
It could have been much worse.
"We've always underestimated submarine volcanoes," said Taaniela Kula from Tonga Geological Services.
WATCH: USV Maxlimer mapped the caldera of Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha’apai
The best time to see the spectacle is shortly after sunset.
Mercury will also be more visible further south.
Unlike stars, planets do not twinkle.
Saturn and Jupiter will be brightest, and Mars will be a salmon red colour.
But in the north of England and Scotland clouds could obscure the view.
They say maintaining the network will be "impossible" without robotics.
But a recent  Ofwat report pointed to a lack of investment by water companies.
Water UK responded saying that leakage was at "its lowest level since privatisation".
Wasted water has been a particularly sensitive issue this year.
Water UK accepted that progress needed to "accelerate".
The technological revolution in leak prevention, according to some scientists, will be miniature robots.
Some companies already use tethered robots to investigate pipes that are inaccessible.
But most of the network is currently inaccessible without digging.
This is where much smaller, artificially intelligent machines come in.
Pipebots are miniature, mobile robots with cameras for eyes and all-terrain legs.
It has implications not just for industry, but for our impact on the environment."
"We can't do this without robotics."
This led to a drop in combustion pressure and acceleration.

Better seafloor maps help us with navigation and conservation, among many other uses.
This is an area broadly equivalent to the land surface of Europe.
Hi-res is nice; we can work with it.
But lower resolution is perfectly acceptable.

One of Seabed 2030's stars is the American adventurer Victor Vescovo.
"We have a 'map the gap' strategy," Mr Vescovo told BBC News.
"We're not a commercial outfit so we don't have to follow the most fuel-efficient routes.
The former US Navy reservist has himself contributed over 3 million sq km.
To map these places is going to require direct tasking of autonomous or semi-autonomous technologies.
During this 28-day voyage, the robot boat mapped 22,000 sq km of seafloor.
Saildrone Surveyor is 22m in length.
But truly huge autonomous vessels are coming.

"A much smaller cousin, or sister, doesn't necessarily add to what we know about the dinosaurs' extinction, but it does add to our understanding of the astronomical event that was Chicxulub," the University of Texas at Austin researcher told BBC News.
"These are interesting questions to pursue, because to learn that Chicxulub might have this extra excitement of a second crater at the same time changes the story a little bit about how Chicxulub came to be."
"There's been a classification system in place for almost two centuries that's based on the chemistry and the crystal structure of minerals, and ours adds the dimensions of time and formation environment," he told the Science In Action programme on the BBC World Service.
"If we find it, it's not going to be that we find one particular species of mineral; it's going to be the trace of minor elements, the morphologies, the sizes and shapes of these minerals.
Yet in an age where science has never been more advanced, and where our capabilities to collect and analyse data are unsurpassed, we are still having to contend with some of the biggest threats we've ever faced.
Think about getting humans to the Moon, how we've transformed medicine and surgical procedures, or created new ways of communicating and keeping our societies secure; or simply how we've come to understand the workings of our planet.
If people are the key to making change and unlocking the solutions to complex challenges, we need to create environments that bring everyone together - the decision makers (often global leaders, governments and policy makers), along with entrepreneurs, innovators, activists, and scientists.
For those solutions to create real change and make a difference, we must never forget that at the heart of every major challenge are the individuals and communities who are connected to that challenge, and impacted by it.
A good understanding of what motivates a community and the values it holds, both individually and as a collective group, needs to be incorporated into solutions so that those solutions don't just work in a lab, but have traction in reality.
It raises a question - is science being looked to at the right times and in the right ways? Is science part of the ongoing conversation as we seek to make the world a better place?
In other areas, such as the development of the gene-editing technique Crispr and its application to humans, the regulation of the technology and its interaction with society has been similarly varied in different states and nations.
Therefore, if science that incorporates an understanding of people is one of the keys to making breakthroughs in these critical global challenges we face, we need to have scientists incorporated into decision-making teams and leadership bodies.
It is well known now that increasing diversity generally leads to increased creativity, greater innovation, faster problem solving, better decision making; and in companies, this leads to increased profits and better reputation.
We have seen this in action within the forum as it creates opportunities at physical meetings and in online settings for interactions between scientists and decision makers and global leaders (from across the tech, business and creative industries).
They bring together the diverse insights and understandings we need, of how people think and are motivated, and point us to the infrastructures that will frame how solutions can be deployed effectively.
Those decisions were made by government, healthcare, business and science leaders to not only achieve a viable vaccine, but ensure access to the doses needed, as well as start a broadscale delivery of them to the adult population by the end of the year.
In short, science can't just be brought in when a crisis emerges, we need an ongoing and dynamic conversation between scientists and the leadership teams that are tackling the big complex world challenges.
Ashley Skett, director of operations at Sea-Kit, told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science programme that the operators can even communicate via radio with other vessels in the area, so much so that other boats wouldn't know that nobody was on board Maxlimer.
The landowner, Adam Knight, had no idea his English longhorn cattle were grazing on top of a rich fossil seam, recalling a time, 183 million years ago, when his farm would have been lying under warm tropical ocean waters.
Leaks are a widespread and complicated problem: Across the UK, hundreds of thousands of kilometres of pipe - of varying age and in varying condition - supply millions of properties with water.
It's thought a further 10-15% is still squirrelled away on servers, in part because the owners worry they might be giving away commercial or defence secrets if they release the information.
At the moment, our knowledge of just over three-quarters of the planet's underwater terrain comes only from low-resolution satellite measurements that have inferred the presence of tall seamounts and deep valleys from the gravitational influence these features have on the sea surface.
And while the participants recognised new technologies were essential to fulfilling the quest, Dr Lucy Woodall cautioned that the 2030 project would fail unless it engaged all communities with an interest in the data.
She cited examples of companies going into coastal areas to map the seafloor and then not sharing any of the information with the local people whose livelihoods depended on those waters.
The high-tech drones are fitted with cameras and laser technology called light detection and ranging (LiDAR), which scans sewers for issues like cracks, holes, partial collapses, infiltration, and root ingress.
A spokesperson added: "It will actually create more work because, as we roll it out, we'll be able to carry out more sewer inspections on parts of our waste water network that we could not reach using the traditional 'worker entry' methods.
"It will mean that the continuing uncertainty will drift on and we will have more of the problems we are already seeing, such as a brain drain and the exclusion of leadership from major programmes," he said.
The assumption was that if differences over the Northern Ireland Protocol could be resolved, the UK would fully re-join the Horizon programme under terms similar to those it had before Brexit.
Sources say that while some aspects of the Horizon programme are appealing to the Prime Minister, such as grants to individual scientists, he believes that larger institutional grants favour France and Germany and may not represent good value for money.
This would allow the UK government to sign up to those parts of the programme that appealed, then use the remainder of the money that would otherwise have been spent on Horizon on its Plan B.
If the Prime Minister has not been close to the discussion, we need to make clear that that is the message from the research community and in the UK's economic interest to secure this deal as quickly as possible," she said.
Prof James Wilsdon, a specialist in research policy at University College London, said the failure to commit to the current arrangement on offer from the EU showed that the government was not listening to the science community.
"To keep the whole UK research system hanging on in limbo for two years while we ostensibly seek association; then to walk away when we finally have it in our grasp would, I think, be for many UK scientists, the final straw," he said.
But the EU went back on its part of the deal after disputes emerged over the Northern Ireland Protocol and British involvement in the prestigious programme has been left in limbo ever since.
He also failed to make a commitment to the programme when asked at Prime Minister's Questions this week and the FT has reported that he was holding back on committing to the programme.
In truth, the disturbance needed to unsettle the blocks is quite significant, and that got husband and wife geologists Drs Dylan and Anna Rood wondering about how these great stones could be used to decipher earthquake history.
Think about it: if a precariously balanced rock has held its position for 10,000 years without tipping over, it means the land around the stone hasn't experienced shaking above a certain level in all that time.
Can it expect a certain threshold of shaking once every 100 years, or every 1,000 years, or indeed only once every 10,000 years? The answer will bear directly on the cost of a safe construction as well as the insurance risk.
But there will be places where that record is sparse - places where it's known large tremors can occur but where the history of the size and frequency of events is extremely patchy.
For these sites, geologists will normally conduct what's called a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in which they'll try to model the possibilities, taking account of all the potential local sources of earthquakes, such as nearby fault lines.
But precisely how much shaking would be needed, and how long the blocks have been in this free-standing state are the two unknowns the team had to solve to use the PBRs as inverse seismometers.
Working out the second part - the "age of fragility" - relies on a smart technique that tracks changes induced in the rocks as they've been exposed to energetic space particles through time.
The reason this type of assessment is so useful in the specific case of Diablo Canyon is that the main quake "threat" comes from the so-called Hosgri Fault, which is located some 6km offshore, under water.
"And unlike [land faults] where you can just go dig trenches and reconstruct the magnitude-frequency relationship and the amount of slip per time, etc - that's incredibly hard to do with these offshore faults.
"The vertical joints set is all you need. And, once you know what you're looking for and get your eye in - they are actually much more ubiquitous than you might think."
If you want to know where the most inefficient housing stock is in a city, where energy is being wasted, where you could best target insulation expenditure - the new thermal data-sets will tell you.
It's not as big as the one we know at Chicxulub in Mexico, but still it speaks to a catastrophic event.
Dubbed Nadir Crater, the new feature sits more than 300m below the seabed, some 400km off the coast of Guinea, west Africa.
With a diameter of 8.5km, it's likely the asteroid that created it was a little under half a kilometre across.
The hidden depression was identified by Dr Uisdean Nicholson from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK.
He'd been analysing seismic survey data, looking for somewhere to drill, to better understand past climatic changes on Earth.
The asteroid that created the Chicxulub Crater in the Gulf of Mexico is estimated to have been about 12km across.
It gouged out a 200km-wide depression, and in the process set off mighty earth tremors, tsunamis, and a global firestorm.
So much dusty material was thrown into the sky that Earth was plunged into a deep freeze.
"This would have generated a tsunami over one kilometre high, as well as an earthquake of Magnitude 6.5 or so.
"The energy released would have been around 1,000 times greater than that from the January 2022 eruption and tsunami in Tonga."
But to make a definitive statement, rocks in the crater itself would need to be pulled up and examined.
Or it might have struck the planet a million or two years either side of the Mexican cataclysm.
Scientists will only know for sure when rocks from the west African crater are inspected in the lab
When the penguins poop on Antarctica's Elephant Island, a little bit of magic happens in the soil.
The name comes from Sphenisciformes - the label used to describe penguins' grouping in the avian tree of life.
The crystalline compound is just one of roughly 6,000 such minerals recognised today by the International Mineralogical Association.
Simply put, minerals are specific combinations of chemical elements arranged into an ordered, crystalline form.
Biology has had a direct or indirect role in the creation of about 50% of mineral species.
Oxygen is a very reactive gas, and it changes the surface of Earth by oxidising minerals.
So more than 2,000 new minerals formed on Earth as a result of oxygen in the atmosphere.
"Scientists and engineers would love to be able to reproduce what life is able to do."
Hazen's and Morrison's work is summarised in twin papers published by the international journal American Mineralogist.
The pair have built a database of every known process of formation for every known mineral species.
For each mineral, the duo detail the recipe used; the particular physical, chemical or biological process involved - and combinations thereof.
"So, we see many different kinds of calcite, and that's key to our new approach to mineralogy."
At the other extreme are the mineral whippersnappers that totally owe their existence to just a few centuries of human industrialisation.
It's their local associations that's going to be the smoking gun for life on Mars."
It's a policy making position they should continue to occupy beyond the pandemic, writes Prof Ruth Morgan. But how?
The rate of ice melt, the impact of a global pandemic, the capabilities of artificial intelligence, and the impact of fake news.
But science will need to become more than this if we are to make the breakthroughs in the global issues we currently face.
It is probably not contentious to suggest that complex global challenges need science involved in the search for those solutions.
We need many different (and perhaps disruptive) perspectives to a specific issue to find the right solutions.
The World Economic Forum's Young Scientists programme seeks to bring together some of the brightest minds in science from across the world.
As Young Scientists, we have found a role for scientists as ambassadors and communicators, and not just as subject matter experts.
This type of dialogue, often started at specific events, continues throughout the year, and  creates conversations.
The UK government's vaccine taskforce has delivered a national rollout of vaccines at a pace that is phenomenal.
This success has its roots in many decisions that were made in very early 2020 in a climate of great uncertainty.
But science isn't only needed when the challenge we face has a clear scientific dimension like a pandemic or climate change.
These issues rarely have simple, single-discipline solutions that can be identified in one-off events or meetings.
The Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV) Maxlimer is part-way through mapping the opening, or caldera, of the underwater Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano.
The data collected so far has confirmed earlier reports of continuing volcanic activity from HTHH.
In a dark control room in Sea-Kit's HQ, several large screens display live feed images from the 10 cameras on board Maxlimer.
Operators, who work in shifts around the clock, watch on as real-time data gets beamed in from the South Pacific.
"The boat has been designed from the ground up to be remotely controlled and remotely operated.
When surveying a dangerous area such as the active HTHH volcano, remote control ensures no crew are put in harm's way.
As there is no onboard crew to support, the vessel can be much smaller, leading to reduced carbon dioxide emissions.
The eruption of HTHH in January caused extensive damage far beyond Tonga, triggering a massive tsunami that spread across the Pacific Ocean.
Maxlimer is currently taking a short break while some rough weather passes through the region.
A ferocious-looking fossil fish has been unearthed from a remarkable new Jurassic dig site just outside Stroud, in Gloucestershire.
The creature - a tuna-like predator called Pachycormus - is beautifully preserved in three dimensions.
With its big teeth and eyes, it gives the impression it is about to launch an attack.
"Its mouth is open - and it looks like it's coming out at you from the rock."
The couple found the fish head in a grassy bank behind a cow shed in the village of Kings Stanley.
It had been encased in one of the many limestone nodules that were falling out from an exposed clay layer.
A digger was brought in to extract hundreds more of the nodules, which were carefully cracked open to see what they held inside.
Scientists say they are stunned by what they've learnt about the ferocity of the Tonga volcanic eruption in January.
When the underwater mountain blew its top, it sent ash and water-vapour half-way to space, and generated tsunami waves across the globe.
A survey by New Zealand and UK vessels has now fully mapped the area around the Pacific volcano.
It shows the seafloor was scoured and sculpted by violent debris flows out to a distance of over 80km (50 miles).
The mapping exercise at the Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Haʻapai seamount was led by NZ's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa).
Two-thirds of that was the ash and rock ejected out through the volcano's caldera, or opening.
This transport took the form of pyroclastic density currents, which are avalanches of tumbling, scorching rock and gas.
The survey work tracked flows that even managed to travel up and over elevations of several hundred metres.
This explains, for example, the loss of the submarine cable connecting Tonga to the global internet.
A good example is the biggest wave to hit Tonga's main island, Tongatapu, 65km to the south of Hunga-Tonga.
A wall of water several metres high washed over the Kanokupolu peninsula, destroying beach resorts in the process.
Niwa natural hazards specialist Dr Emily Lane believes an atmospheric pressure anomaly increased the height of the tsunami waves.
The Niwa survey, formally called the Tonga Eruption Seabed Mapping Project (TESMaP), was carried out in two parts.
The first stage, which mapped and sampled the seafloor around the volcano, was conducted from New Zealand's Research Vessel (RV) Tangaroa.
The second stage, directly above the mountain, was given over to the British robot boat USV Maxlimer.
It's remarkable that only six people died in the 15 January event, and two of those were in Peru.
"There are five additional just surrounding Tongatapu. It means we need more planning and urgent planning."
There will be a chance to see all the planets in the solar system in the night sky on Thursday.
Five should be visible with the naked eye, while the two furthest away, Uranus and Neptune, will be better viewed with binoculars.
It will be challenging to see Mercury and Venus in the UK due to their low position in the sky.
Dr Massey advises sky-watchers to try to find a clear vantage point to look towards the south-west horizon shortly after sunset.
Venus should appear the brightest, low in the south-west towards the horizon, but it will be a challenge from the UK.
Jupiter is the next brightest planet, and should appear higher in the sky where Saturn should also be visible.
Skies are forecast to be clearest in the south-west of England and the south and west of Wales.
In June Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were visible when they aligned in a rare planetary conjunction.
Pipebots are laden with sensors and designed to be small enough to patrol water pipes without blocking them
Engineers have now developed miniature robots to patrol the pipe network, check for faults and prevent leaks.
Water industry body Water UK told BBC News that companies were already "investing billions" in leakage.
It named several that it said were "letting down customers and the environment" by not spending enough on improvements.
And, amid the cost of living crisis, Ofwat estimates 20% of customers in England and Wales struggle to pay their water bill.
In the last year, though, according to Ofwat, companies have reduced leakage by an average of about 6%.
The industry has committed to a government target of halving the amount of water lost by 2050.
We visited the site of a leak repair with Essex and Suffolk Water, which is owned by Northumbria Water.
"We've covered the biggest leaks - burst pipes that that people see. It's these smaller, hidden leaks that we need to find."
"Companies only respond reactively to faults at the moment, not proactively," explains Prof Kirill Horoshenkov.
"We need to have the presence of robots so they can continuously collect data before the onset of faults."
They're designed to make decisions about whether the pipe is likely to develop a fault or not."
Artificial intelligence specialist Prof Netta Cohen from the University of Leeds says the biggest challenge for pipebots is communication.
"Underground, there's no GPS. So they will communicate with each other at short ranges (using sound or wifi)."
She and her colleagues are developing a system where a larger "mother" robot carries and deploys a group of miniature robots.
"They will deposit these little guys to go into the smaller pipes and collect them when they're done," explained Prof Cohen.
"We will need a whole society of these robots to work in all these kilometres of pipe.
"If you think about the state of our infrastructure," she added, "it is so urgent to do something.
The water pipes beneath our feet, said Prof Cohen, are some of the most inhospitable environments on Earth.
At ICAIR, the team hopes the first pipebots will patrol the water network within five years.
They've traced the problem to the failure of protective material that was lining the throat of an engine nozzle.
When it became clear Vega-C wouldn't make it to orbit, a self-destruct command was sent, which also annihilated the satellites onboard.
The rocket stage, or segment, that failed in December, was the Zefiro 40, which ignites about 144 seconds after lift-off.
It was the only stage to use this particular carbon-carbon throat insert, manufactured in Ukraine.
Both have a total of four stages that they burn in sequence as they climb higher and higher into the sky.
Crucially, the old Vega has a different second stage and this will allow for an earlier flight.
"It will be by the end of summer," said Stéphane Israël, the CEO of Arianespace, the company that operates the rocket.
The Ariane-5, Europe's biggest rocket, has only two more flights this year before it is withdrawn.
Its Euclid telescope and Hera asteroid missions will go up on SpaceX Falcon-9 vehicles in 2023 and 2024 respectively.
Slowly but surely the proportion of the global ocean floor that's been properly mapped is rising.
It's now up to just shy of a quarter of the total area under water - at 23.4%.
Some 10 million sq km (3.8 million sq miles) of new bathymetric (depth) data was added in the past year.
The update was given at the second UN Ocean Conference, taking place this week in Lisbon, Portugal.
"One of the messages we're trying to get across is that we don't require high-resolution data.
Sea maps are essential for safe navigation, obviously, but also for fisheries management and conservation.
In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water.
Water piles up over the mass of a large submarine mountain and dips slightly where there is a trench.
It's super smart but an underwater mountain that's hundreds of metres tall can still fail to show up in such observations.
And this isn't just about measurements from big ships; small ocean-going yachts fitted with data loggers can also make a contribution.
Many parts of the world are so remote, few ships will visit them, let alone acquire depth data in those regions.
It was gathered by the Saildrone Surveyor on a cruise between San Francisco and Honolulu last year.
The marine robotics company Ocean Infinity is currently building a fleet of 78m-long ships in Vietnam.
Their work would be overseen from satellite-linked control centres in the UK, the US and a third location somewhere in Asia.
Progress to full mapping of the seafloor was discussed in a side meeting at this week's UN Ocean Conference.
It carried out the UK's first drone inspection at a sewer on Bath Street, Glasgow in July.
Similar inspections are expected to be rolled out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and some rural areas.
Scottish Water said the more accurate inspections will cut the cost of repairs and maintenance and reduce the risk of flooding and pollution.
Two workers pilot a drone as it flies along pipes and can inspect the area using video.
It added that the technology would not adversely affect jobs, pay or conditions of any workers involved.
The technology including its software was developed by Environmental Techniques, a surveyor based in Northern Ireland.
Scottish Water said the drones would be flown to parts of its 33,000-mile network that traditional surveys could not reach.
But the specific adaptation of both drone and the 3D LiDAR modelling is what makes this special.
That quality is four times better than a HD TV and it's certainly a first in Britain.
Prof Sir Adrian Smith told BBC News that reneging on government promises would be damaging to UK science.
His comments follow reports that Rishi Sunak was holding back on re-joining the €95bn programme, known as Horizon.
BBC News understands that he is considering renegotiating a cut-down version of the Horizon programme.
This would be a UK-led programme involving collaboration with non-EU as well as European nations.
It was developed in case a research agreement could not be reached with the EU.
All history shows that this kind of cherry-picking and negotiation Is not up for grabs.
Horizon Europe is a collaborative research programme involving Europe's leading research institutes and hi-tech companies.
The agreement of the Windsor Framework last week paved the way for the UK to re-join.
We've all seen them; we've even taken pictures of ourselves pretending to hold them up or to push them over.
As proof of principle they studied PBRs near the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant in coastal Central California.
The amount of shaking is worked out by taking lots of photos of the PBRs and making a 3D model.
Various equations will then elicit the strength of the ground accelerations required to topple the rock.
Cosmic rays when they hit the oxygen atoms in chert's quartz minerals will generate the radioactive element beryllium-10.
The results of the PBR investigation for the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant should be reassuring, says Anna.
But how available are they? Can you find sufficient numbers of them to make inverse seismometers a widely applicable technique?
Drs Dylan and Anna Rood, and colleagues, report their PBR work in the journal AGU Advances.
But we say no, no, no - there are 10, 15 maybe 20 different kinds of calcite, because the calcite deposited by a shell is very different from the calcite that forms on the ocean floor through just chemical precipitation, or calcite formed deep within the Earth in a process of metamorphism - of high pressure and high temperature.
We have seen a range of different responses to the global pandemic and involvement of science in policy decisions, from closing borders and restricting all movement of people to more graded restrictions on household mixing, face mask policy, and the creation of exemptions for certain groups of people.
The vessel, developed by the British company Sea-Kit International, is surveying the volcano as part of the second phase of the Tonga Eruption Seabed Mapping Project (TESMaP), led by New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) and funded by the Nippon Foundation of Japan.
The Niwa team says there were essentially four ways water was displaced to generate these tsunamis: by the density flows pushing the water out of the way; through the explosive force of the eruption also pushing on the water; as a result of the dramatic collapse of the caldera floor (it's dropped by 700m); and by pressure waves from the atmospheric blast acting on the sea surface.
All the results from TESMaP will feed ultimately into hazard mitigation, in preparing Pacific nations sited close to the volcanic zone that runs from New Zealand's North Island all the way to Samoa. They'll know better now where to build infrastructure and how to protect it; and, importantly, to appreciate the scale of the risk they face.
"Mars at the moment is at its best from the UK now until about 2032. It's going to be quite a long time before we see this one again, so it's well worth taking a look now," Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society told BBC News.
Colin Day from Essex and Suffolk Water said: "In [this region] alone, we look after more than 8,500km (5,282 miles) of pipe and only about half the leaks in those pipes are visible, which means it's complicated to pinpoint where [the rest] are."
"But I think it confirms to the community that, first of all, we have well understood the problem, and, secondly, that the measures we're putting in place are well accepted as the right ones, and therefore we have full confidence that we will succeed," he told BBC News.
"I would argue to those of you in the room who think technology has got to be the way - I would argue that, actually, people are the way because unless people are asking the questions, unless we have a dialogue with all the voices in the room, then we're not going to ask, and therefore we can't answer, those right questions," the chief scientist with Nekton, a UK-based oceans NGO, told the meeting.
Prof Sarah Main of the Campaign for Science and Engineering said that the UK's previous fruitful membership of the EU programme had attracted investment from the hi-tech companies her organisation represents and that her members want nothing short of the full association that is currently on the table.
When the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Mr Sunak were asked about re-entry to the Horizon programme at a joint press conference, Ms von der Leyen enthusiastically remarked that it was "good news for scientists and researchers, in the European Union and in the UK," but Mr Sunak did not comment.
When an asteroid slammed into what is now the Gulf of Mexico 66 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs, did it have a companion?
The discovery of what seems to be a second impact crater on the other side of the Atlantic, of a very similar age, is raising these questions.
Such surveys, frequently obtained by oil and gas prospectors, record the different layers of rock and sediment underground, often to a depth of several kilometres.
"These surveys are kind of like an ultrasound of Earth. I've spent probably the last 20 years interpreting them, but I've never seen anything like this," he told BBC News.
"Nadir's shape is diagnostic of an asteroid impact. It's got a raised rim surrounding a central uplift area, and then layers of debris that extend outwards."
"Our simulations suggest this crater was caused by the collision of a 400m-wide asteroid in 500-800m of water," explained Dr Veronica Bray from the University of Arizona, US.
Nadir has been given a very similar date to Chicxulub based on an analysis of fossils of known age that were drilled from a nearby borehole.
This would also confirm Nadir is indeed an asteroid impact structure and not some other, unrelated feature caused by, for example, ancient volcanism.
The idea that Earth may have been hit by a cluster of large space rocks in the past is not a new one.
And people have already speculated that the impactor that created Boltysh Crater in Ukraine may also be related to the Chicxulub event in some way.
Prof Sean Gulick, who co-led the recent project to drill into the Chicxulub Crater, said Nadir might have fallen to Earth on the same day.
"Was this a break-up of a parent body that had multiple fragments that hit Earth over time? Was Chicxulub a double asteroid where a smaller object orbited a bigger one?
But the IMA's classification system, which describes so much of the "hard stuff" all around us, has just undergone something of a reboot.
Dr Robert Hazen from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC has spent the past 15 years reclassifying the minerals to add information about their genesis.
You'll know some of the most common ones, such as feldspar, quartz and mica, which make up the granite in a kitchen worktop.
But with colleague Dr Shaunna Morrison, the Carnegie Institution researcher has tried to give the thousands of different mineral species some extra context.
The point the pair are making is that you can't truly appreciate the significance of a mineral unless you also understand how and when it formed.
Their research shows nature has used 57 "recipes" to create 10,500 of what they like to call "mineral kinds" - by crushing, zapping, boiling, baking and more.
"These are shells, teeth, bones, and other structures in organisms that are purposefully deposited and sculpted in the most amazing nano-technology kinds of ways.
Dr Hazen said: "The previous system of mineralogy said calcite is calcite; that's calcium carbonate in the calcite crystal structure, that's a species.
For example, there are 500 or so minerals that are the direct result of mining activity; 234 of these are produced in coal mine fires.
Hazen's and Morrison's work not only puts the mineralogy of Earth into its proper historical context, it also becomes a tool to investigate other worlds.
These are all big challenges where science informs us and pioneers the tools we need to unlock the next steps in tackling them.
At the same time, we also need to be clear about what science can and can't do as we look for solutions.
It is individuals, teams and communities who are the changemakers, and so good science needs to incorporate a clear and nuanced understanding of people.
Yet, the way we involve science in significant policy decisions, and incorporate both technical knowledge along with understanding the wider impact on the communities affected, is really varied.
Creating spaces for this kind of ongoing interaction makes it possible for science that engages deeply with people, societies and their physical and cultural environments.
That kind of dialogue will lead to significant opportunities for decisions based on science to be integrated into strategy, horizon scanning, and in developing the solutions that have real impact.
In the UK, we are seeing the promise of this kind of dialogue that has taken place in the response to the pandemic.
Science has a contribution to make as we seek to tackle every kind of big challenge, whether that is global poverty, education, equality or securing justice.
Scientists can bring data, insights and transformational discoveries, but they can also bring alternative viewpoints and ways of thinking to tackle the big issues of our time.
They need collective, multidisciplinary, interactive, creative, strategic thinking that incorporates not only economics, politics, policy and business insights, but also science.
For real impact and change this needs to become the norm and it needs to be happening across the board, within government, and in business and industry.
We have never lived in a time when creating opportunities for scientists to be incorporated into global leadership and decision making has been more urgent.
If we can make it a reality, we will ultimately be able to collectively deliver the solutions that are needed to address the big global threats of today and tomorrow.

A robot boat, controlled from the UK, has returned from an initial survey of the underwater Tongan volcano that erupted explosively back in January.
A winch on the boat allows instruments to be deployed at depths, reaching 300m, in order to collect data from the entire water column.
The 12m-long Maxlimer may be in Tonga, but it is being remotely controlled from 16,000km away in the small coastal village of Tollesbury in Essex.
"We use 5% of the fuel that an equivalent manned vessel doing the same job that we're doing now would use," Ashley said.
Once conditions improve, the boat will head back out to the underwater volcano to fill in remaining gaps in its map of the caldera.
The collected data will help us understand why the eruption had such a huge and violent impact, as well as help predict the nature of future eruptions.
"It was a real surprise because, when you find fossils, most of the time they've been pressed flat through pressure over time," Neville told BBC News.
"But when we prepared this one, to reveal its bones bit by bit, it was amazing because we suddenly realised its skull was uncrushed.
Mr Knight gave permission to Neville and Sally, and a team led from the University of Manchester, to investigate the bank further.
The haul included more fish, squids and even the bones of two ichthyosaurs, hugely successful marine reptiles that looked a bit like a large dolphin.
Interestingly for a marine setting, there is also fossilised wood and insects in the clay layer, suggesting land was not that far away.
There is particular interest because the specimens were extracted from a rare UK example of a time slice in the early Jurassic - the Toarcian Stage.
It is known for exceptional preservation, including of soft tissues, and the team has a fish, for example, in which it is possible to see the stomach contents.
"The last comparable exposure like this was the so-called Strawberry Bank Lagerstätte, in Somerset, in the 1800s - that got built over," Sally said.
They recently uncovered the remains of mammoths in the nearby Cotswold Water Park, featured in a BBC documentary fronted by Sir David Attenborough.
They also made headlines with the discovery of thousands of fossilised echinoderms - starfish, sea urchins and brittle stars - in a quarry in the north of the county.
"These sites tell you there are still many nationally and indeed internationally significant fossil discoveries yet to be made in the UK," Dr Lomax said.
The intention is to stage a public display of the fossils at the Boho Bakery Café, which is very close to Court Farm, in October.
The gathered data indicates that at least 9.5 cubic km, perhaps as much as 10 cubic km, of material was displaced during the cataclysmic event.
"You can think of it as 'a shotgun blast' straight up into the sky," said marine geologist and Niwa project director Dr Kevin Mackay.
"Some of that material went beyond even the stratosphere into the mesosphere (57km in altitude) - the highest recorded eruption column in human history," he told BBC News.
The other third was material scraped off the top and the sides of Hunga-Tonga as debris fell back down to sweep out across the ocean bottom.
In water, their searing heat would have enveloped them in a frictionless steam cushion on which they could simply run and run at very high speed.
A large section was cut out of this data link despite lying 50km to the south of Hunga-Tonga and beyond a large hill on the seafloor.
"And yet, amazingly, just under the rim of the volcano, in places that avoided these density currents, you do find life. You find sponges. They dodged a bullet."
Waves were recorded across the Pacific but also in other ocean basins - in the Atlantic and even in the Mediterranean Sea.
"For the big local waves - in order to understand them correctly, I believe you also have to have this atmospheric coupling," she explained.
Operated by Sea-Kit International from a control room 16,000km away in Tollesbury, UK, this uncrewed vehicle was able to identify ongoing, albeit relatively subdued, volcanic activity.
The boat did this by tracing a persistent layer of glassy ash in the caldera back to its source - a new vent cone some 200m under water.
TESMaP was funded by the Nippon Foundation of Japan and organised with the help of Seabed2030, which is an international effort to properly chart Earth's ocean floor.
Those further south, including southern Europe or closer to the equator, are more likely to be able to see all the planets appear in a vertical line up into the sky.
Anyone looking through a telescope should be able to see details like the moons of Jupiter and perhaps cloud systems or dark markings on Jupiter and Mars, Dr Massey says.
Around three billion litres of water are lost through leaks across hundreds of thousands of miles of water pipe in England and Wales daily, says water industry economic regulator Ofwat.
According to Water UK, three companies - South East Water, South West Water, and Yorkshire Water - still have localised hosepipe bans in place following the summer drought.
"We're adopting the latest technology, including special in-pipe cameras; satellite imaging; thermal drone technology, high-tech probes, and artificial intelligence," it told BBC News.
At a suburban site, a team was carefully excavating - navigating the overlying sewer pipe, gas supply and electricity cables to locate an underground leak.
"This one wasn't visible - we detected it through monitoring flow in our network," said Colin Day from Essex and Suffolk Water.
Essex and Suffolk Water is testing "non-dig" repairs, including sealants that can be safely injected into pipes to repair cracks before they develop into a major leak.
A new generation of underground robotic pipe patrollers is being tested at the Integrated Civil and Infrastructure Research Centre (ICAIR) at the University of Sheffield.
They are being developed in collaboration with the water industry to patrol pipes and find cracks and weaknesses before they develop into leaks.
Holding the toy car-sized robot in his hand, Prof Horoshenkov explained: "They move along the pipe, taking pictures and they have a microphone to listen to the pipe.
Until then, each time there is a leak, the water companies will have to dig -  around the maze of sewer pipes, gas supplies and cables - to fix it.
The fault that resulted in the loss of Europe's premier small rocket, Vega-C, during a launch in December has been identified by investigators.
The European Space Agency (Esa) said on Friday the measures needed to address the failure meant that Vega-C would not fly again until later this year.
When it does finally return to the launch pad, it will be given the task of lofting Sentinel-1C, an eagerly awaited radar spacecraft owned by the European Union.
Nonetheless, a programme is now being put in place by the Italian rocket producer Avio to ensure components right across the Vega-C vehicle meet the highest quality possible in future.
A new insert material will be sourced, and a full-duration firing of a Zefiro 40 segment will be conducted on the ground to prove its robustness.
Satellite operators in Europe were already chasing a limited number of rocket rides, and December's failure has complicated their options still further.
The war in Ukraine, and the resulting western sanctions, mean Russian Soyuz rockets - a mainstay of European space operations - are no longer on the market.
Much of this additional data comes not from recent mapping efforts, however, but simply as a result of governments, institutions and companies agreeing to open up their archives.
"But they really needn't worry," said Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of Seabed 2030, the organisation that is trying to corral world efforts to obtain a complete picture of Earth's ocean bottom.
"One depth value in an area the size of a European football pitch, 100m by 100m or thereabouts, isn't going to give away national or commercial secrets."
This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a pivotal role in moving heat around the planet.
The UK's new polar ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, is equipped to map millions of sq km of ocean bottom over its career.
The yellow rectangle in the centre is a cover made of a synthetic material over the 8m-long array of transmitting transducers for the deep-water multibeam echosounding system.
Seabed 2030, which is funded by Japan's Nippon Foundation, is encouraging anyone who ventures away from the land to switch on their sonar equipment and take depth soundings.
The Texan financier is using a submersible to visit the deepest places in the world's oceans, but everywhere he goes his support ship switches on its echosounder.
When we go on an expedition we ask [Seabed 2030], 'what are your priority areas?'; and we divert a little bit to cover those areas."
It's clear, however, that to come close to obtaining a full picture of the shape of Earth's ocean bottom, there will need to be a step change in approach and capability.
There is a glimpse of how this will work in one line of data featured in the map at the top of this page.
Regulations will probably mean they have to be lean-crewed for the near future, but the goal eventually is to have them roving the ocean without anyone onboard.
Such ships could be sent out on long missions to map hard to reach areas at much lower cost than would be incurred by a conventional crewed vessel.
The utility company said the technology replaces the need for workers to carry out inspections, will provide more accurate readings about conditions and will help reduce emissions.
This method replaces 15 workers who would have traditionally carried out inspections - though this method will still be used in other parts of the network.
Scottish Water said the drones help cut down on staff working in dangerous conditions in confined spaces with the risk of hazardous gases.
It added this method could reduce carbon emissions from sewer surveys by as much as 80% by reducing the number of site vans and vehicle deliveries.
Iain Jones, the company's risk and life cycle planning manager, said: "Drones have been put into sewers elsewhere with limited capabilities and limited success.
"Some of the sewers pre-date the Victorian era and are more than 160 years-old and we need information to enable us to make good decisions about how to rehabilitate them if necessary."
PM Rishi Sunak should not go back on his pledge to re-join the EU's science research programme, the President of The Royal Society has warned.
Prof Smith told BBC News that ministers had consistently said that they were fully supportive of full association with the Horizon programme once the EU gave the green light.
"There is a great deal of concern and anxiety at the rumours that there is now a desire to renegotiate our association of the Horizon programme.
But BBC News understands that Mr Sunak is keen on an alternative research programme put together by ministers, known as "Plan B".
While no decision has yet been taken, one option under consideration is for a complete renegotiation of the terms of the Horizon agreement currently in place with the EU.
"There is an assumption that we are in charge of the renegotiation and that we can have the good bits and get out of the not so good bits.
''The whole thing is a package and the point is that the entire programme has in the past been good for the UK," he said.
EU member nations each contribute funds which are then allocated to individuals or organisations by expert scientists based on the merit of research proposals.
The government negotiated associate membership of the programme in the withdrawal agreement following Brexit, because it felt it was important for the UK to be involved.
"The turn of phrase we're trying to coin is that these precariously balanced rocks, or PBRs, are an 'inverse seismometer'," explains Anna.
"A normal seismometer records an event that has happened, whereas our PBR is still standing there, and so it records an earthquake that hasn't happened.
This is really useful information if you want to build a nuclear power station or waste repository; or maybe a major dam or bridge.
Knowing how robust that structure needs to be requires an understanding of the seismic hazards that could reasonably be foreseen during its lifetime.
Planners may be fortunate in that the location where they want to put up that new power station already has a detailed, instrumented record of seismic behaviour.
What Dylan and Anna have now shown is that any precariously balanced rocks in the vicinity can be used to constrain those models by excluding the most far-out-there possibilities.
These are tall chert blocks that have eroded free of the surrounding rock platform and as a consequence could fall over given the right amount of shaking.
Counting the amount of Be-10 in the blocks' surfaces therefore gives an estimate for how long the stones have been in their precarious situation.
"We all know we're on shaky ground in California, but our results show that it's not as shaky as we had feared.
Satellite Vu is attracting a lot of interest with its plans to fly a network of spacecraft to map heat signatures across the planet.
Such observations have long been made, but not at the resolution (3-4m) and frequency (several times a day) that the London firm is promising.
Dave was a quiet child and he rarely talked to anyone.
He  does not like  running like other kids and making noise.
Someone from the landed UFO spoke to Dave in an unexpectedly friendly tone:
He said that his people had been  observing Earth for one thousand years.
Listening to this the little boy Dave was silent for a little period.
So, while he pondered his options, he looked down at his hands.
That's when he had an epiphany and stretched his left arm.
The Alien Gygar was stained with the taste of candy bars.
He kept on eating another bite of the chocolate.
Gygar exclaimed, "This is the most amazing dish I've ever tasted!"
He asked Dave "And you claim you make it here on Earth?".
So Gygar returned without destroying earth and kept visiting Earth to eat chocolate.
Once Manoj and his friends were playing in an open place.
While they are playing an object which was large crashed into the playground.
The object was like an unidentified flying object (UFO).
Manoj and his friends came to the crashed site.
Suddenly a ball came rolling to them from the UFO.
Suddenly manoj grew 200 times larger than his original height.
Manoj removed the belt and he came to his original height once again.
Kiran took the belt from Manoj and started observing the belt.
They saw a robot which was lying on the floor.
Manoj clicked the ‘start’ button unknowingly and UFO started to fly.
After sometime they were landed on a planet.
They got out of the UFO and started walking.
Dave was at a party and eating his candy bar quietly in a corner, sitting on the grass in the park, and clutching the candy bar softly but firmly in his left palm.
He preferred to sit quietly in a corner and read a book, watch a movie, or, in this case, enjoy a candy bar.
In fact, he genuinely considered sobbing and fleeing, which is usually a smart idea when confronted with something terrifying, but Dave assumed it would be considered a forfeit, and Gygar would blow up the Earth.
Confused, Gygar opened one of his right hands and allowed the little human to place something brown in his green palm, half-covered by a plastic wrapper.
Ginger said that he needs that candy bar again and again and if they destroy the earth he would not be able to have candy bars.
“Greetings, Earth Human.
Gygar shrugged and took a bite of chocolate.
Dave smiled and nodded.
They were playing football.
Manoj picked it up and started observing it.
He noticed a button which was red.
He pressed the button.
Suddenly the ball became into a belt.
Manoj wore the belt.
All his friends looked at him surprisingly.
He saw a symbol which represented a robot.
All of them went into the UFO.
While all of them are observing the UFO.
The UFO took them into the space.
Suddenly, many robots came and surrounded them.
The robots took them to their leader.
Manoj said “Yes, Sir I will”.
Then Manoj took him to the UFO.
Optimus Prime went insdie the UFO.
He saw the robot lying in the UFO.
The other kids liked Dave, but because of his quiet nature turned some of them off.
That day Dave unwrapped the candy bar and was about to take the first bite when he noticed lights above him.
He was surprised when he looked up as it was a spacecraft descending from the sky.
My name is Gygar and I am from the planet Ramzok many, many lightyears from here.” That was Alien.
His six-year-old shoulders were suddenly bearing the weight of the universe, and he wasn't sure he was equal to it.
Dave pretended to eat while explaining to the alien what he should do with the candy bar.
That's how this peaceful young guy saved the planet while also introducing chocolate to the farthest reaches of the universe.
The area just outside Earth's atmosphere is known as space, commonly known as outer space.
The Kármán Line, which is roughly 100 kilometres or 62 miles above the Earth, is where space officially begins.
There is no oxygen in space, unlike on Earth, which is why astronauts must travel in high-tech spacesuits.
Space is a vacuum, meaning it is absolutely devoid of any substance, such as air, making it absolutely quiet and dark.
Since sound is transmitted by air molecules, it is impossible for sound to exist in space without them.
Harry Styles' introspective-but-gossipy pop smash As It Was has been named the UK's most-streamed song of 2022.
It was also the biggest song globally on Spotify and Deezer, with Justin Bieber's Stay topping Apple's chart.
Styles has said the song is about "metamorphosis", as he reflects on loneliness, growing up and moving on.
Spotify said As It Was had been streamed a total of 1.5 billion times this year.
While Styles' hit was uniformly loved across the three streaming services, there was a huge divergence further down the chart.
Apple's audience leaned more towards pop, charting songs by Adele and Elton John that didn't appear in Spotify's list.
Deezer, which has a much smaller market share, restricted its charts to music released in 2022.
Taylor Swift was the most-played artist for those listeners, with Drake and Ed Sheeran in second and third place.
Meanwhile, LF System's Chaka Khan-sampling dance hit Afraid To Feel was the most Shazammed song of the year.
"Yaaasss! It's an honour that people want to discover and hear our music," said the Scottish duo.
Other streaming services, including YouTube and Amazon Music, have yet to release their figures.
And for the first time, they'll be shown how many times they pressed play on their favourite song.
But some of the people who work on the app are reluctant to make their results public.
"The music we enjoy throughout the year becomes like a soundtrack," said Oliver Schusser, vice president of Apple Music.
"It's really fun to be able to go back and relive those meaningful and memorable moments over again."
People cut back on video streaming services in their droves last year as the cost of living rose sharply.
Demand had picked up again at Christmas, Kantar said, but people were "quickly looking to cut back again".
Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, is at its highest level for about 40 years, hitting people's finances.
It was the only streaming service that they were subscribed to but chose to make the cut to help save costs.
Instead he and his partner use options that do not require an upfront subscription fee, such as Channel 4 on demand.
One of its main rivals, Walt Disney, has also continued to grow its streaming business despite cost-of-living pressures.
The Golden Globe Awards take place in Los Angeles later, but it is uncertain how many nominees will attend.
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) was accused of ethical lapses and a lack of diversity in 2021.
As a result, some stars denounced the Globes, but others are aware of the awards momentum a win there can bring.
The HFPA announced a series of reforms in an effort to restore faith following a string of damaging allegations.
While the 2022 Globes ceremony was pared down and not televised, this year they are attempting a comeback.
The HFPA will hope that announcing such big names in advance will encourage others to show up.
In 2021 he handed back his three Golden Globes in light of the controversy engulfing the HFPA.
Prior to the controversy, the Golden Globes were one of the more popular awards ceremonies with viewers.
One reason for the ceremony's high entertainment value was the often shrewd choice of presenter.
While not a household name in the UK, Carmichael is a well-known figure on the US comedy circuit.
"Tables heaped with free booze, [when] other awards are theatre seating and totally dry.
I quickly found that the threat of hearing something awful about themselves made them listen."
Inventive multiverse comedy-drama Everything Everywhere All at Once, starring Michelle Yeoh, follows with six.
Babylon, Damien Chazelle's reflection on 1920s Hollywood, has five nominations, as does Steven Spielberg's autobiographical The Fabelmans.
This is largely down to the crucial fact that the Globes ceremony is televised.
A well-received speech can put them on the radar of the large number of Academy voters who watch the Globes.
Austin Butler, Diego Calva and Barry Keoghan are among the younger nominees this year.
The interest is hardly surprising - Khan is among India's biggest and most-loved stars.
His fans endearingly refer to him as King Khan or the King of Bollywood.
Reports say there has been "exceptional response" to advanced ticket sales in the US, UAE, Germany and Australia.
The plot, described by fans as a crossover between James Bond and Mission Impossible films, is rather predictable.
A terrorist group is seeking to destroy India with "an attack they could not have imagined".
The two-and-half-minute trailer has excited fans and critics alike, who've been gushing over the scale of the project.
Khan has had a fair share of troubles with the press and critics in the past.
"Khan is one of the remaining few actors who represents that past which some sections want to be obliterated completely.
There have been sustained calls to boycott Pathaan and abusive hashtags have trended on social media.
"They will watch Pathaan first day first show because they have missed him on screen," she adds.
Chatterjee says he has "some reservations" about the movie, but it is "a daring idea".
And whether the gamble pays off or not, one thing is certain: "You don't miss a Shah Rukh Khan film," he says.
Netflix has launched its 'Basic with Ads' streaming plan in 12 countries - which it intends to expand over time.
It's a massive change for the tech giant, which pioneered the world of ad-free, subscription-based streaming.
But as rising costs and offerings from new rivals prompt audiences to quit, the company had to act.
In announcing the new service, Netflix said it was confident it now had a "price and plan for every fan".
Kaitlyn from South West London, told the BBC she had no plans to change.
More than a quarter had already moved to cut one, with concerns about cost ranking as the single biggest driver.
Disney, for example, is due to roll out an advert supported service in December in the US.
Netflix has said customers on its ad-supported plan will face an average of four to five minutes of adverts per hour.
"I wouldn't mind watching an advert if it meant it was cheaper," students Lottie and Frankie told the BBC.
Even if the audience is not large, it could still prove lucrative for Netflix.
Others, however, were "very keen to get involved in the initial launch phase", she added.
Netflix could generate $830m from commercials next year and more than $1bn by 2024, according to  estimates by Insider Intelligence.
But that's not the only thing questionable about Sima aunty - or the show.
She's still nicer to men - they are "good boys" while women are "inflexible" or "difficult" or even "superficial".
"You won't get 100%," she keeps reminding them, adding that "60-70%" is a reasonable expectation.
Critics also accuse the series of promoting stereotypes and say it makes no effort at diversity.
"It represents only one kind of people," says Shailaja Bajpayee, editorial adviser to The Print website.
And it has already been renewed for season three which will focus on matchmaking in the UK.
"Gone are the days when uncles and aunts and other relatives would suggest a match," Mr Nahata says.
And they're all looking for matches from the same background as in caste and religion.
You have one woman saying she doesn't just want a Gujarati match, but that he also must speak Gujarati.
"Some of the things we do and say and believe and have internalised over generations are cringey.
It's difficult to face those topics of conversations; it's difficult to see that reflected back at you."
But, she added, that by raising difficult topics, the series provided families an opportunity to have "tough conversations".
And this show is a hard-sell of a patriarchal construct - that marriage is a be-all and end-all."
"Over the course of my career I have been photographed and filmed by many talented men.
Even millennials - who would usually prefer memes, hyperbole and Reels - say they are enjoying her deep, thoughtful captions.
As one user put it: "The metaverse can be a quiet, graceful space, if you want it to be.
Of course, Aman is no stranger to fame and attention, both good and bad.
In the coming years, Aman would continue to be a trendsetter, experimenting with roles far ahead of their time.
"In the world of commercial Hindi cinema it is very easy to get stuck with labels.
Mind you, women have a very set thing to do - sing songs, look pretty," she told the BBC in 2013.
Aman's "Western image" was fiercely debated throughout her career but the actor remained comfortable in her skin.
Decades later, Aman is no longer the smouldering diva from the peak of her career.
Her thoughts about not wanting to dye her grey hair struck a chord with followers.
"I was initially reluctant to stop dyeing my hair, and was strongly advised against it...
In post after post, Aman insists that an older woman does not lose her beauty or agency.
"In general, as we age, men are bequeathed gravitas but women are at best offered sympathy," she writes.
Some women told the BBC that Aman's posts reminded them of their own vitality and agency.
Disney's streaming business has continued to grow - but its losses are rising too.
But the unit lost nearly $1.5bn - a hit that weighed on the company's overall bottom line.
Chief executive Bob Chapek said Disney+ had reached a "turning point" and would become profitable by 2024.
That was lower than analysts had expected, sending shares down more than 5% in after-hours trade.
"Quest for subscribers comes at a cost and success is not guaranteed," he said.
Mr Iger said that Disney's animation studio has sequels "in the works".
Meanwhile, the firm revealed its first fall in subscriber numbers since its Disney+ streaming service launched in 2019.
And Mr Iger said he would cut 7,000 jobs in a major shake-up of the entertainment giant.
In a call to investors, Mr Iger spoke about his plans to monetise some of its biggest franchises.
The latest instalments would be the third in the Frozen franchise and a second Zootopia.
There have already been four Toy Story films as well as last year's spin-off Lightyear.
The changes came alongside its latest quarterly figures, his first since he returned to Disney in November.
Mr Iger said the changes would "better position us to weather future disruption and global economic challenges".
Disney reported an 8% rise in sales to $23.5bn between October and December last year.
However, Disney+ reported a $1.5bn loss and its subscribers fell by around 2.4 million to 161.8 million.
Disney's share price rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the announcement.
Disney hasn't had the success it might have wished for in creating new animated franchises over the past few years.
So it was perhaps inevitable that Disney would return to them at some point.
Management at Disney now plan to do everything that we wanted them to do," he said.
"We will be watching, we will be rooting and the proxy fight is over."
Mr Iger made a shock return as Disney's chief executive, less than a year after he retired from the firm.
Mr Chapek was ousted after Disney's streaming business posted a $1.5bn quarterly loss.
Less than 24 hours after his return to Disney, Mr Iger said he was planning a major shake-up of the business.
Four years ago, Khan was accused of sexual misconduct by eight female colleagues and a journalist.
He had denied the accusations and no police case was brought against him.
It is extremely insulting and demoralising to victims and survivors who continue to fight for justice today," the petition says.
"The power equation in the Hindi film industry is entirely tilted in favour of men.
But women who want to join the industry go there to make a career just like you and me."
We are asking them to not celebrate someone who has got very serious allegations against him."
Viacom18, which owns ColorsTV and Voot, has not responded publicly to the criticism yet.
He denied the allegations, but was suspended by the Indian Film and Television Directors' Association for a year.
After he was also dropped as director from his film Housefull4, he tweeted in 2018:
The fall from grace, he said, was "God's way of telling him that he had to become a better person".
When a beautiful princess leaned over and tried to resuscitate her comatose lover with a kiss, she made cinematic history.
Karma, like a lot of the cinema of the time, was steeped in "exotic orientalism".
"The myth is that it's over four minutes long but that is not true," Ms Desai says.
To begin with it was not one kiss, it was a series of kisses.
In 2007, protests broke out after Hollywood actor Richard Gere kissed Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty at a charity event in Delhi.
So, Karma stands out just because of the fact that a film made such a long while back featured a kiss.
"Himanshu Rai was already a success in Europe where he was considered a rising star.
The film got rave reviews, Ms Desai says, especially for Devika Rani, with "critics impressed by her beauty and diction".
But she returned with Rai to Mumbai to set up India's first professional studio, "where she got really busy working hard".
Talented and beautiful, Rani ruled the hearts of her fans and was dubbed "the First Lady of Indian cinema".
On one occasion, she wrote that he hit her with a script until she fell on the floor bleeding.
She lived there until her death in 1994, a year after her husband died.
"After her marriage to Roerich, she probably got the life she wanted," Ms Desai says.
Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan has opened to huge fanfare and enthusiastic reviews in India.
The much-awaited spy thriller marks Khan's grand return to the big screen after a four-year hiatus.
Analysts say the film, which released on Wednesday, is already on track to become the first big hit of 2023.
"Bollywood is back. Shah Rukh Khan is back," film reviewer Shubhra Gupta wrote in her review for The Indian Express.
Its trailer, which dropped on January 10, has been watched more than 50 million times on YouTube.
Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill, which gained a new lease of life this year after being featured in Stranger Things, was the UK's fourth most-streamed song on Spotify, for example, while being entirely absent from Apple's Top 10.
That created space for Nigerian rapper Rema, whose laid-back hit Calm Down was his second most-streamed song of the year; and Camila Cabello, whose duet with Ed Sheeran, Bam Bam, came third.
Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny was the most-played artist overall on Spotify for the third year running, thanks largely to his Grammy-nominated double album Un Verano Sin Ti (A Summer Without You).
Spotify's Wrapped has been expanded, with the service's 456 million listeners discovering not only their most-played songs and podcasts, but the tracks they favour at different times of the day.
"Brits' love of streaming remains as strong as ever, but the effect of high inflation meant consumers were forced to make difficult choices to balance their finances," said Dominic Sunnebo, Kantar's global director of entertainment on demand.
But Kantar said it reflected "short-term" demand in the run-up to Christmas, and more than one in 10 consumers planned to cancel one or more subscriptions in the first three months of this year.
But it also plans to crack down on password sharing, charging users more if they want to share Netflix with people they do not live with, and says it expects a negative reaction in the short term.
However, Kantar said growth at Disney+ in the UK was slowing, with the platform accounting for 11.7% of all new subscribers in the last three months of 2022 - down from 19.3% in the same period a year earlier.
There have been a string of television adverts trailing ahead to the Globes, while billboards around Los Angeles proclaim "Hollywood's biggest party is back". But that will only be the case if Hollywood actually shows up.
The latter two are also nominees - Curtis for best supporting actress for her performance in Everything Everywhere All At Once, and de Armas for best leading drama actress for her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe in Blonde.
Brendan Fraser, who is nominated for best actor for The Whale, has said he will not attend the ceremony after accusing former HFPA president Philip Berk of groping him in 2003.
He is not nominated for best actor, but his film Top Gun: Maverick was one of the biggest movies of last year and is nominated for best drama picture.
Scarlett Johansson previously encouraged others in the film industry to "step back" from the organisation, while her Avengers co-star Mark Ruffalo wrote last year that the HFPA's reforms were "discouraging".
However, a tweet from the official Globes account on Tuesday suggested Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez, MJ Rodriguez, Jennifer Coolidge, Jenna Ortega and Rihanna will be attending the ceremony.
Taking place in early January, most celebrities are usually on good form at the Globes, thanks to the Christmas break they've just enjoyed, coupled with plenty of complimentary drinks.
Baz Luhrmann's Elvis Presley biopic, Guillermo del Toro's stop-motion animation Pinocchio, and Todd Field's excellent drama Tár, starring Cate Blanchett as a disgraced orchestra conductor, all have three.
On the television side, school-based comedy Abbott Elementary leads with five nominations, while there are four apiece for The Crown, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, Only Murders in the Building, Pam & Tommy and The White Lotus.
While a win at the Globes is not a guarantee of Oscars success, it can often be helpful in raising the profile of a film or actor and give them a momentum boost.
The gap has piqued interest in Khan and also led to a heightened scrutiny of the film, which also stars Deepika Padukone, one of India's most popular stars, and John Abraham.
"If you dare to party at Pathaan's house, then I will have to come to greet you - with fireworks," an unmistakable voice sneers at us, as Khan makes an appearance.
A suave spy with tousled hair and chiselled biceps and abs, Khan effortlessly takes down enemies, hops on moving vehicles, rappels down skyscrapers and seduces women while trying to save his nation from evil forces, led by Abraham.
Over the years, he points out, the actor has experimented with scripts, playing different types of roles, such as the ones in My Name is Khan, Chak de India and Love You Zindagi.
The 33-year-old said she was lucky to be able to afford the cost of her subscription and thought the move Netflix was"a desperate bid to attract more people" that would end up hurting the brand.
But a recent global survey by the Simon Kucher consultancy found that more than a third of streaming customers were likely to cancel a subscription with the next 12 months, especially in markets such as China, India and the US.
"Netflix is making its move into ad supported streaming at exactly the right time and we expect uptake to be fast and significant, as consumers battle to take control over their expenses," he said.
But analysts at Enders Analysis said they did not think many of the company's current viewers would find the savings worth switching for, nor was it likely to draw in large numbers of new subscribers.
"We find it bizarre that some have opined that there will be a material quantity of Netflix subscribers that will actively pursue ad-supported video to save a couple of pounds a month," the firm wrote in a recent note.
Indian Matchmaking - the "cringeworthy" Netflix show that created a huge buzz in India and many parts of the globe two years ago - is back with a second season.
Here, everything happens for a reason - and that is to find a bride or a groom because, as Ms Taparia explains at the outset, "first is marriage, then love" and "everything gets adjusted after marriage".
The new season includes some of her old clients from season one and a number of new faces, hoping that Ms Taparia, who claims to be "Mumbai's top matchmaker", will help them find "The One".
To many, the faith these rich and successful millennials put in the matchmaker - popularly known as "Sima aunty" - may seem questionable, considering none of her matches from the previous season worked out.
In the new season, the matchmaker's edges are softened a bit and she seems to be holding her tongue sometimes - possibly because of the backlash - but the show is still riddled with sexism and gender biases.
So Akshay, a male client who calls himself the "world's most eligible bachelor", is allowed to call women "chicks" and the female clients are routinely told to temper their expectations.
It was also among the top 10 in 13 countries, including in the US, Canada and South Africa, in the first week of its release and remained on the list in seven countries for another week.
Film and trade analyst Komal Nahata says the interest in the show is because season one was "a huge and roaring success - not just among Indians but also in the US and several other countries".
"Because of the growing number of divorces, relatives - or even parents - do not want to get involved, so that they don't get blamed if a marriage doesn't work out.
"What I found most odd was that all these women in the US - who are educated and independent and are free to marry whoever they want to - still seek out someone like Ms Taparia.
It's especially absurd, she says, in a country where thousands of brides are killed every year over insufficient dowry, marital rape is not criminalised and thousands of housewives are driven to suicide every year.
"I want to ask Netflix why are you putting your money into a show that propagates mass misogyny? Why not have a show on single women?" she asks, adding that "marriage is not the benchmark for our lives."
That's how Zeenat Aman, who captivated Indians in the 1970s with her trailblazing style and unconventional Bollywood roles, described herself on Instagram earlier this month, when she made her debut there.
The 71-year-old has only posted about a dozen times so far - mostly photos of herself with musings on ageing, her eventful career and her pet dog Lily - but her presence has captured people's attention and imagination.
Wearing comfortable linen overalls and perched on a stool near a patch of sunlight, Aman ruminated in her caption about how dominant the male gaze was in films and fashion during the 1970s.
But the most remarkable part about her Instagram debut is that an actor whose most memorable performances occurred four decades ago has managed to connect with a much younger audience almost instantly.
That same year, she catapulted to dizzying fame with her performance in the hit film Hare Rama Hare Krishna, where she played a naïve, young flower child who is a drug addict.
Her most controversial role was in 1978 - Satyam Shivam Sundaram sparked a flurry of controversies because of the scanty outfits worn by Aman's character Roopa and an intimate scene between her and the actor Shashi Kapoor.
"I was always quite amused by the accusations of obscenity as I did not and do not find anything obscene about the human body... Rupa's sensuality was not the crux of the plot, but a part of it," she wrote.
On Instagram, the actor is charming and exudes an air of naturalness as she reminisces about her youth and stardom, not through a lens of regret, but simply from the vantage point of being older.
"We believe we are on a path to a profitable streaming business, assuming that we do not see a meaningful shift in the economic climate," he said on a conference call to discuss the firm's results.
Disney has poured billions of dollars into its streaming platforms in recent years, remaking itself from a company rooted in traditional television and movies into one of the streaming industry's major players.
"I'm so pleased to announce that we have sequels in the works from our animation studios to some of our most popular franchises: Toy Story, Frozen and Zootopia," he said.
The announced job cuts amount to around 3.6% of Disney's workforce around the world and are part of a plan to save $5.5bn (£4.5bn) and make its Disney+ streaming service profitable.
And while the film did much much better on Disney+, it's likely that it was watched and enjoyed more by existing subscribers, rather than encouraging new viewers to join the service.
Freddy Colquhoun, investment director at JM Finn, told the BBC: "Disney has been in quite a bit of trouble over the last year or so and in particular with trying to make its streaming business profitable."
At the time he said he had tasked a group of executives with designing "a new structure that puts more decision-making back in the hands of our creative teams and rationalises costs".
But ever since the show revealed the names of the housemates, hundreds of people, many of them women, have taken to social media to express their "disgust" and "anger" at his inclusion.
The protest is also because of the reach of Bigg Boss - it is considered to be India's most popular reality show, racking up tens of billions of hours of viewing time.
In India where there is deep-seated patriarchy, Ms Chauhan says that women already have an uphill battle and this sends out a message to those who made the allegations against him that they are being totally unseen and unheard.
The allegations against Khan came in 2018 - after the MeToo movement started in the US, many women in India took to Twitter to call out comedians, journalists, authors, actors and filmmakers.
But his return to the limelight obviously hasn't gone to plan - the outrage over the allegations against him have meant that many are still unwilling to give him a second chance.
The kiss - from the 1933 film Karma - featuring real-life couple Devika Rani and Himanshu Rai - has long been written about as the first-ever Bollywood film to have a lip lock and "Bollywood's longest kiss ever".
The press at the time reported that the kiss was more than four minutes long, and the couple exchanging it on screen have been the subject of much myth-making in India ever since.
Rai and Rani went on to set up Bombay Talkies, India's first professional film studio, in 1934 which dominated the first decade of talking cinema in India and set trends, many of which are still followed to this day.
A 2020 book, which recently received the National Film Award for Best Book on Indian Cinema from the country's president, tries to set the record straight on the kiss and the tumultuous lives of the couple.
Described as "a love drama", the 63-minute film was directed by British filmmaker JL Freer Hunt and boasted that it "featured actual royal palaces and scenes of oriental splendour".
The kiss takes place almost at the end of the film as the desperate princess kisses the prince in a bid to revive him as he lays unconscious, bitten by a cobra.
And the kiss was not a selling point of the film at the time, she says, adding that "it became a popular myth much later, most likely created by the press".
But, she adds, the intention behind making this film was not its popularity but to use it "as a showpiece to tell the world that they could make cinema for the world stage from Bombay".
After Rai suffered a nervous breakdown and died in 1940, Devika Rani ran the studio as a producer, giving breaks to legendary actors such as Madhubala and Dilip Kumar, and delivering many superhit films.
Some have critiqued the film's plot - calling it over the top and silly - but others said that Khan had managed to revive his magic on the silver screen.
Ms Gupta said it was a dazzling affair of "non-stop action, leavened by glamorous leads, topped by the guy who can save the world, a high-octane set piece and an emo line at a time".
Film critic Deepanjana Pal, who writes for the website FilmCompanion, called Pathaan "a hero for today's India" who brings familiar gestures to the role but in new and different ways.
Film critic Nandini Ramnath said there were moments when "the narrative slumps, when the stunts feel too familiar or derivative, when the thrills look like they are in danger of running out".
Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer all said the track was their top performer of the year, beating competition from Ed Sheeran, Drake and Taylor Swift.
Spotify listeners showed a huge appetite for UK rap, with releases by Dave, Aitch and D-Block Europe all performing well.
However, he could not replicate that success in the UK, where audiences still seem averse to music sung in languages other than English.
The Official Charts will reveal the overall biggest songs of the year - tallying streams, downloads and physical sales - in January.
The statistics come as the streaming services release their end-of-year recaps - which provide users with a customised deep dive into their listening statistics.
Fans will also be given a "listening personality" - that analyses their habits in categories such as "exploration vs familiarity" or "variety vs loyalty".
"It's always interesting to see who wants to share and who doesn't want to share," said Tom Connaughton, MD of Spotify for the UK.
"If you go and stand by our music team, they're the least likely to want to show you [their results] because they're scared of what it says about them."
Apple has also revamped its Replay feature, telling users how many individual songs and artists they played over the year, and preparing a playlist of their most-played songs.
It also produces a shareable list of your Top 10 artists, along with the number of minutes you spent listening/dancing/driving/studying/falling asleep to their music.
Analysts Kantar said the number of paid-for video streaming subscriptions in the UK fell by two million, from 30.5 million to 28.5 million.
"That financial pressure increasingly meant cutting back on video streaming subscriptions, particularly where households often had three or more different services in the same household."
Gregory Bortkiewicz, 36, and his partner Tanya Kant, 37, from Brighton subscribed to Netflix a decade ago and chose to cancel their subscription last summer.
"I always found myself flicking though it and not finding good content so me and my partner decided we should cancel it," Greg, a consultant, told the BBC.
He said he does not regret it as "there are so many other options and it got to the point where the little amount we were paying, adds up".
Kantar said the UK streaming market returned to growth in the last three months of the year, with new subscriptions up by 300,000 compared with the previous quarter.
Last summer Netflix, the world's biggest video streaming company, said it had lost almost a million subscribers between April and July worldwide after it put up prices.
But in the last three months of 2022, the Californian company reported gaining seven million, taking the total number of signed-up viewers to 231 million.
The firm has launched a cheaper service with adverts in 12 countries, including the UK, which it plans to roll out more widely.
In November, the media giant said it had added more than 12 million subscribers globally to its Disney+ streaming platform in the three months ending in September.
The organisation behind the ceremony hopes to restore the status of the Globes, as well as its own reputation, after a controversial two years.
The Banshees of Inisherin and Everything Everywhere All At Once lead the 2023 nominations at the film and TV awards, followed by Babylon and The Fabelmans.
The newspaper's investigation also alleged the group often accepted "freebies" from studios and PR agencies who were campaigning for nominations, along with other ethical failings.
The expose led NBC to cancel its broadcast of the 2022 ceremony, which ended up taking place behind closed doors with few stars in attendance.
Meanwhile, the HFPA announced a series of reforms, such as expanding and diversifying the membership, and a ban on accepting promotional items from film and TV studios.
All eyes will now be on Tuesday's ceremony at the Beverly Hilton hotel to see whether the Globes have been let out of Hollywood's dog house.
We know four stars who will definitely be there - director Quentin Tarantino and actors Billy Porter, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ana de Armas.
The HFPA found that Mr Berk "inappropriately touched" Fraser, but that it "was intended to be taken as a joke and not as a sexual advance".
In 2022, he won an Emmy for writing his stand-up special Rothaniel and was nominated for guest hosting Saturday Night Live that same year.
"Traditionally, it was always considered the most fun [of the awards] to be at," Gervais told the Telegraph earlier this week.
The Banshees of Inisherin, a dark comedy starring Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, leads the pack at the Globes with eight nominations.
Rachel Zegler, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Ariana DeBose, Emma Corrin, Richard Madden, Awkwafina and Taron Egerton have all won trophies when their stars were on the ascent.
But there are also titans of the big screen in contention for major prizes - such as Cate Blanchett, Olivia Colman and Daniel Craig.
Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's latest film Pathaan, which releases on Wednesday, has been hitting the headlines in India for the past several weeks.
Charming, funny and with millions of fans at home and abroad, the actor is often described as Bollywood's "most important cultural export", whose popularity travels beyond his films.
Starting in December when the filmmakers began releasing promotional videos of Pathaan's songs, the film has been the subject of incessant chatter on social media.
Khan's tweet of the Hindi trailer has had 3.9 million views and an additional half a million each for the Telugu and Tamil versions.
A fan called it a "paisa vasool [value for money] experience", adding that he would try to catch the film as soon as it released.
But ever since his comments about growing religious intolerance in India a few years back, the barrage of attacks from Hindu right-wing groups have become more personal and concerted.
"It has acquired a distinctly communal twinge, as they seek to anchor the actor's image around his religious identity," says author and film critic Saibal Chatterjee.
Until a few years back, he says, Bollywood was seen as a place that existed beyond religious and political differences and "entertainment was the only thing that mattered".
They accused Khan of insulting Hindus as saffron is a colour associated with their religion, even though Padukone changes costumes several times during the song.
But as the countdown to Pathaan's release begins, Khan and the filmmakers have skirted around the controversies, instead concentrating on the film's promotion.
And earlier this month, Khan visited Dubai where a large crowd of cheering fans watched Pathaan's trailer, projected on the façade of Burj Khalifa.
From the actor's reputation to the film's 2.5bn rupee ($30m; £25m)-budget, a lot is at stake and some have wondered if the negative publicity could impact the film's success.
"Khan is not just an actor, he is a brand, probably the biggest we've had in the country, and most certainly in Bollywood," he says.
Shrayana Bhattacharya, author of a book called Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh Khan, says the star's fans will "never reduce him to religion or political calculations".
But some are wondering if the spy-thriller genre is the right kind for Khan's return to the big screen after a four-year gap?
Khan made his name playing a romantic hero, an actor who defined love - its language, fickleness and the anxieties that come with it - for an entire generation.
And women, who make up a large part of his fan base, may not be interest in seeing him as an action hero.
A few days back, the actor said he always wanted to be an action hero and that's why Pathaan "is a dream come true for me".
"But at this point in his career, he can afford to do that. He is fearless and he is experimenting. He has nothing to lose."
People settling in to their sofas for a bit of Netflix now have a new option  - to pay less for their favourite shows but watch with adverts.
It is charging £4.99 a month in the UK, and $6.99 in the US for the new plan - a roughly 30% discount to the firm's cheapest ad-free option.
At Netflix, the number of subscribers fell by more than 1 million in the first half of the year, as the company pushed through its latest round of price hikes.
That's a tiny fraction of its roughly 220 million global accounts, and the company made up for those losses over the three months to September.
But while Netflix once distinguished itself by being commercial free, surveys by Kantar and others suggest that acceptance of adverts among audiences is growing.
For now, both aged 20, said they weren't directly concerned with the expense of Netflix, since they watch on someone else's account.
With Netflix warning of plans to crack down on password sharing, they said the new option could be "good for students".
Among non-subscribers, however, a survey in the US by DISQO found only 25% to 35% were interested in signing up for a service with ads.
But forecasting analyst Peter Newman cautioned that the new plan will draw most of its sign-ups from Netflix's existing audience, rather than expanding the pool of viewers.
It has once again renewed the debate about whether the show is regressive or if it holds up a mirror to society.
Despite its immense popularity, season one was called out for in-your-face misogyny, casteism and colourism and caused much outrage, with many describing it as regressive.
There are no lower castes or religious minorities, except for one Sikh, and I can't remember seeing anyone who has darker skin colour."
Despite the criticism, the series was among the top five shows in India for two weeks since its launch on 10 August.
"For people in the West, where most go to Tinder and Bumble and other websites to find matches, the show had shock value.
This type of matchmaking that we have in India is very unique and Westerners couldn't believe that it actually happens like this," he told the BBC.
In India too - where 90% of all marriages are still arranged - there's growing interest in professional matchmaking, at least in cities and towns.
"It made me sad to think that all these women have learnt nothing from living all these years in America," she adds.
In an interview with Variety last week, Smriti Mundhra, the show's creator, agreed that "some of the show is cringey".
Her first couple of posts were photos shot of her by a young woman photographer in the "comfort of [her] home".
The post has since been shared thousands of times across social media platforms, with Aman being praised for sparking a meaningful conversation in the simplest of ways.
She was already a successful model when she started her career in Bollywood in 1971 with small role in a film called Hulchul.
From blowing smoke rings in crowded, dingy rooms to dancing in scanty tie-dye dresses with hippies, Aman - and the film - transformed women's fashion in the film industry.
She was not a traditional Bollywood heroine - her unconventional beauty, bold fashion choices and outspoken ways stood out too much.
"Gradually even I got absorbed into the mainstream but towards the second half of my career I did films that had different roles."
In one of her Instagram posts, Aman revisited the controversy as she shared a photograph of herself taken during a camera test for the film.
She had a magnetic screen presence, but it was the self-assurance with which she conducted her life - including traumatic personal experiences - that made her even more popular.
It was only once I contemplated upon my own hesitations that I realised I really don't care to buttress our society's idolisation of youth," she wrote.
The actor also includes light personal anecdotes - last week, she said she learnt the meaning of the word "thirst-trap" from her sons.
As one Twitter user said: "Zeenat Aman joining Instagram is one of the best things that has happened on the internet in recent times."
The media giant said it had added more than 12 million subscribers to its Disney+ streaming platform in the three months ended in September.
The company now counts more than 235 million subscriptions across its three streaming platforms, which also include the sports-focused ESPN+ and wider enterainment site Hulu.
As it turns its focus to profitability, Disney has announced plans to raise prices and introduce a version of Disney+ with adverts.
Overall the company said revenues rose 9% in the three months ended in September, and were up 23% for its financial year.
The firm was also hurt by weakness in its traditional movie and television business, which saw declines in advertising, and rising costs cut into its profits.
Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said it was a "disappointing quarter" that "underlines the challenges a media giant faces in pivoting towards a streaming future".
Disney chief executive Bob Iger has announced sequels for Toy Story, Frozen and Zootopia as he detailed plans to turn around its streaming business.
"We'll have more to share about this production soon, but this is a great example of how we're leaning into our unrivalled brands and franchises."
The plan will see the company restructure into three segments - entertainment which will include film, TV and streaming; sports-focused ESPN and Disney parks, experiences and products.
"This reorganisation will result in a more cost-effective, co-ordinated approach to our operations," Mr Iger told analysts on a conference call.
One of Bob Iger's key strategies in his previous stint running Disney was to maximise the use of popular properties in its existing back catalogue.
The last instalments of Toy Story and Frozen both took more than $1bn at the global box office, as did Zootopia (Zootropolis in the UK).
No doubt it hopes that as well as performing well at the traditional box office, well-known titles like this will also help to drive increasing numbers to Disney+.
Disney's changes address some of the criticisms raised in recent months by billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz, who criticised the company for overspending on its streaming business.
In an interview on Thursday with the business broadcaster CNBC Mr Peltz said he would no longer seek a seat on the board to push for change.
He was brought back to steer the company through turbulent times after its share price plummeted and Disney+ continued to make a loss.
Mr Iger, who had previously headed Disney for 15 years, replaced Bob Chapek, who took over as chief executive in February 2020.
Bigg Boss, the wildly popular Indian version of Big Brother, has been mired in an ugly row since it  premiered on Colors TV on Saturday.
The 16th season of the show, hosted by Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, has been criticised for including film director Sajid Khan as a housemate.
Singer Sona Mohapatra said Indian TV channels were a "depraved and a sad lot" for including men called out for sexual harassment.
Since Saturday, ColorsTV and the show's official Twitter account have put out several hundred promotional tweets, but they are yet to respond to the criticism.
Its popularity has gone up many times since 2020 when it was made available on Voot - an Indian digital streaming service.
So calls have been growing to drop Khan from the show - a petition to banish him from the Bigg Boss house has already received more than 5,000 signatures.
Khan's inclusion in the show, she says, alongside one of India's biggest heroes like Salman Khan, will provide him with an opportunity to "whitewash his image" in public.
Khan, a successful director who had worked with some of Bollywood's biggest stars, was among those named by mostly aspiring actresses and a female journalist.
It was packed with clichés the West liked - the Indian royalty, a tiger hunt, mating cobras and a snake charmer.
Public displays of affection on and off screen have been largely taboo in India for decades - though cinematic depictions have got bolder in recent years.
In another incident a couple of years later, a young married couple in Delhi were charged with obscenity for kissing in public.
"The actress singing in an operatic style was not really meant for the Indian masses who didn't like it much," Ms Desai says.
This, she says, was necessary as the prospective investors were British or members of the affluent Parsi community who were very Western in their outlook.
The great-niece of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, she had been schooled in England from the age of nine and "was cast in the Western mould and was cosmopolitan".
One newspaper wrote that "it would be difficult to find anyone lovelier than her" while another raved about "her lovely features and lustrous eyes and graceful movements".
The film catapulted the actress into a league of her own, turning her into "India's only internationally-renowned star, who was being wooed by Hollywood and European cinema".
Her relationship with Rai also soured when she discovered that he was married before and had a daughter," Ms Desai says.
The outbreak of World War Two severely impacted the Bombay Talkies as its entire German staff was detained and put in camps by India's British rulers.
But in 1945, she sold her shares, married Svetoslav Roerich and moved to the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, and eventually relocated to Bangalore.
Bombay Talkies, however, didn't survive long once Rani left - "it limped along for a few years before folding up in 1954", she adds.
The film tells the exhilarating tale of Pathaan, a suave Indian spy played by Khan, who is on a mission to stop a group of terrorists from attacking India.
And on Wednesday, Khan tweeted that 25 single screen theatres had re-opened in northern Indian to screen the film, after they were shut down during the Covid-19 outbreak.
Ticketing platform BookMyShow told news agency PTI that the audience response had been "phenomenal" with over one million tickets booked by Monday itself.
"The romantic hero is gone, replaced by an older, scruffier man who is determined to fulfil the responsibilities placed up him by his circumstances," she wrote.
Uday Bhatia, while reviewing the film for Mint Lounge newspaper, said it was a "maximalist fun, spy actioner that piles spectacle on silly spectacle".
That would have earned the star and his co-writers about £1.5m in royalties.
Kate Bush: "The world's gone mad"
"Thanks to everyone that supported us in 2022 - Big Love."
It said that Prime Video, AppleTV+ and Paramount+ had driven the gains.
New subscriber growth also slowed at Now TV and Britbox, it said.es.
But some will be notable by their absence.
Another big star almost certain to skip the ceremony is Tom Cruise.
This year, US comedian Jerrod Carmichael will take on hosting duties.
"Of course, what's better for the audience isn't always great for the performer.
As audiences get drunker, you have to work harder to get their attention.
The Golden Globes are also particularly good at recognising new talent.
And Pathaan is his first film after a four-year hiatus.
And when its trailer dropped on 10 January, the fan frenzy peaked.
It has been watched more than 51 million times on YouTube.
The authorities scramble to fight them, but time is running out.
At stake is the country's future.
So, they put their best man to work.
A pulsing music track accompanies the shots.
But right from the start, Pathaan has been mired in controversies.
But, he adds, the industry has now become increasingly polarised.
That's why they cannot stand him."
It's an assessment Chatterjee disagrees with.
With Pathaan, he says, Khan is clearly "breaking the mould".
So will people go for it?
But streaming audiences are clearly getting restive.
Many of Netflix's competitors already combine streaming with adverts or have plans to.
That plan will start at $7.99 a month.
"An ad-supported tier isn't going to reverse Netflix's fortunes overnight," he said.

"They are all rich, upper-caste and fair-skinned people.
Thousands have taken to social media to share their impressions of the show.
So, matchmakers have proliferated, they are everywhere."
"Indians have a national obsession with marriage, and it's a very unhealthy obsession.
A woman's gaze though, is different...
No lights, no makeup artist, no hairdresser, no stylist, no assistants.
Just a lovely sunny afternoon together," she wrote.
Zeenat Aman showed us how."
But audiences loved her.
She was also very self-aware.
She truly did.
But her penchant for starting conversations is unchanged.
Being young, she adds, is wonderful.
But so is being old.
"I just love how frill-free and real she is," says another.
And it's not all weighty reflections.
And fans, young and old, loved every bit of her innocence.
Netflix, by comparison, has about 223 million subscribers.
It reported profits of $162m, up from $159m last year.
Mr Iger said he did "not make this decision lightly".
Profit also rose by 11% to $1.3bn.
The company's streaming service remained its top priority, he added.
Its first big post-Covid release Strange World was a box office failure.
So it's no huge surprise to see these sequels being announced.
But he said the results "were actually really reassuring" and beat expectations.
"This was a great win for all the shareholders.
Bob Iger says he's proud of his achievements at Disney
"This is sickening, and this is vile.
"So, we are asking ColorsTV to not give him that platform.
"An industry known for abuse could take a better stand.
In fact, as a country we could take a better stand," she adds.
The BBC has emailed them for comment.
"It's said that failure destroys people.
But in my case, it was success that destroyed me," he said.
Apparently, neither is true.
"The kiss is obviously not the longest ever in a Bollywood film.
If you time it, it couldn't probably cross two minutes."
Protesters burned effigies of the actor, claiming that he had insulted Indian culture.
The film though was a flop.
And that's where Rani's presence helped.
But her relationship with Rai soon began to unravel.
"She was working very hard and was not credited enough.
There was significant Hollywood fallout to a scathing exposé of the HFPA published in the LA Times in February 2021, which found there were no black members in the 87-strong voting body, and that relatively few members worked full-time for notable foreign publications.
Normally, an acerbic host such as Ricky Gervais, Seth Myers or the pairing of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler would make fun of the A-listers in the audience and Hollywood in general, in a way that would not happen at the more formal Oscars.
The 57-year-old is making a comeback on the big screen after a series of setbacks in his personal and professional life, including the arrest of his son Aryan Khan last year on fake charges of drug possession - the charges were eventually dropped - and a number of films that didn't do well.
Already riled by the film's name Pathaan - a Muslim title - the hardline Hindu groups raked up a controversy over one of its songs after Padukone was seen in a saffron-coloured bikini in the song Besharam Rang - which translates from Hindi to shameless colour.
There have been calls to ban the film unless the song is removed, protesters have torn up posters and burnt Khan's effigies, a petition has been filed in a court accusing the cast of hurting the sentiments of the Hindu community and the film has been accused of promoting nudity and obscenity.
During the Fifa World Cup, footballer Wayne Rooney appeared along with the actor in a short promotional video, repeating after Khan in Hindi - "Apni kursi ki peti bandh lo, Mausam bigadne wala hai [Fasten your seatbelts, the weather is about to get turbulent]".
"If they are going to be offering ads, it feels like less of a premium service that people will be happy to continue paying for," she said, adding that clogging shows and movies up with commercials would make Netflix "just another YouTube".
With concerns about the cost of living rising, Netflix with ads has a chance of helping it hold on to its audience, said Dominic Sunnebo, global consumer insight director at Kantar World Panel, which has found that for many of the households in the UK, quitting Netflix means dropping out of streaming altogether.
"This goes against Netflix's (extremely) effective conditioning of its subscription base to see advertising as the ultimate annoyance and expect nothing less than the cleanest and least intrusive video viewing experience possible—a strategy that has worked to the expense of every other competing and trailing service."
There was a "flurry" of interest from advertisers after Netflix announced the service, though some brands became "more reticent" when they found out how much the advertising would cost, said Liz Duff, head of commercial and operations for Total Media, which buys advertising slots for big household name brands,
The eight-part reality TV show - included in the list of the 50 most influential reality TV shows of all time by Time magazine - once again follows elite Indian matchmaker Sima Taparia as she tries to find suitable matches for her wealthy clients in India and the US.
The show has also made headlines in India over Ms Taparia's controversial comment on age difference - she tells a female client that her relationship with a man who is seven years younger is not a good match, "just like that of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas".
Ms Bajpayee says that people go to matchmakers "because it's not easy to find a match, and sometimes you need a bit of help", but adds that there are a lot of problems with the show as "it's still not critiquing regressive ideas" and "just propagates known biases".
But Sreemoyee Piu Kundu, author and founder of Status Single, India's first and only community for urban single women, questions the rationale behind promoting a show on weddings in India "where women are judged all the time for not getting married".
From Sheetal in Roti Kapda aur Makaan (1974), who chooses a suave, rich man over her unemployed boyfriend, to Bharti, a rape survivor on a quest for justice in Insaf Ka Tarasu (1980), Aman constantly pushed the boundaries of cinema and also inspired many women to do the same in their lives.
"At a time when technology and Instagram filters are rewriting our bodies and faces, Aman - with her gorgeous silver bob and soft wrinkles - is sparking a more honest assessment of what it means to be a woman," says one fan.
Announcing them all at the same time (although we don't know when they're likely to be released) is a clear signal to shareholders and audiences that at a time when Disney is cutting jobs and looking to make savings, it will continue to pour resources into areas that have served it well in the past.
Journalist Barkha Dutt tweeted that Khan's inclusion showed "utter contempt for what so many women feel" and MeTooIndia - an unofficial account created by a journalist after the 2018 movement to amplify the voices of Indian survivors - wondered why the organisers were silent.
Sukriti Chauhan, lawyer and public health advocate and a co-author of the petition, told the BBC that the allegations against the director were "quite disturbing, graphic and horrific" and giving him a prime-time slot on one of India's most popular shows was "not right".
"In the wake of the allegations against me and the pressure being put on my family, my producer [and] the stars of my film Houseful4, I must take the moral responsibility of stepping down from my directorial post, till the time I can allay the allegations and prove the truth… I request my friends in the media to kindly not pass judgement till the truth is out."
At Saturday's premier, he acknowledged the allegations against him - he said he had been sitting at home for the past four years because he did not get much work, but blamed his downfall on his "arrogance", saying that after a number of his films became hits, he started to believe that he was infallible.
The trade body for UK airlines said the sector was committed to the 2050 target and that sustainable fuels would be a key factor in reaching it.
Demand for flights is expected to increase, and governments and the aviation industry are experimenting with ways to reduce the climate impacts of traditional kerosene fuel.
The authors of the Royal Society report looked at four options for greener fuels to replace the 12.3m tonnes of jet fuel used annually in the UK.
A new fuel needs to be financially viable, safe, usable around the world, and to have high enough energy density to be used on long-distance flights, they say.
The trade body for UK airlines, Airlines UK, said in response that sustainable fuels were safe and increasingly commonplace, and that the sector was committed to the 2050 'jet zero' target.
"A Frequent Flyer Levy would target reduced demand amongst the group responsible for most of the environmental damage today, while leaving the annual family holiday untouched," he says.
It found textiles were just 4% of what was binned in 2021, in terms of weight, but accounted for 32% of the carbon footprint generated by household waste.
Zero Waste Scotland said that the clothing we buy is often produced via long supply chains which generate large volumes of greenhouse gas emissions at every stage.
The idea is to help people - particularly families with children - reuse clothes and cut down on global emissions as well as the fashion industry's impact on global communities.
Ms Eriksen says the shop has been designed to recreate a typical shopping experience, although admits items can be more expensive than the cheapest clothes sold on the high street.
She said: "Lots of people buy second hand already and it's part of the choices they make as consumers, but for a lot of others, they wouldn't choose to do that.
"If we can see enough of that clothing continuing to circulate at that high level, then we're reducing the demand on the planet and on our global communities as well."
Food waste was the second highest contributor to the carbon impact of household waste - making up 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, but only 18% of household waste by weight.
Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: "If we're serious about tackling climate change we need to rethink our consumption of goods and materials.
The Scottish government funded agency is encouraging Scots to "do things differently" and look to the circular economy model - where people are encouraged to reuse, donate and recycle products.
Emissions from producing and making the raw materials for our textiles is equal to about two and a half times the greenhouse gases emitted from our international aviation and shipping in 2020.
The minister in charge, Green MSP Lorna Slater, said the move would give businesses "the clarity and confidence they need" to take part in the system.
The deposit return scheme (DRS) aims to improve recycling rates for certain bottles and cans by providing a financial incentive to recycle and pick up litter.
The customer can get that money back when they take the empty container to a return point, either over-the-counter at a shop or using an automated reverse vending machine.
Producers have until the end of the month to register for the scheme, which will require them to declare how many items they intend to put on the Scottish market.
Many small businesses have warned that while they support the general sentiments, the scheme will impose unacceptable costs and other strains while they are still recovering from the Covid pandemic.
In particular they are worried about cashflow impact of paying deposits and administrative fees in advance, as well as pressure to produce special barcodes on products destined for the Scottish market.
Producers have to pay the 20p deposit, as well as a small fee, to the scheme's administrator for every item they produce that is destined for sale in Scotland.
They can recoup the 20p by adding it to cost of their products when they sell it to  wholesalers - who in turn pass it on to retailers.
The Scottish Conservatives - who have called for the scheme to be paused - claimed the "last-minute" changes were an acknowledgment that its design was flawed.
MSP Maurice Golden said: "This sudden discovery of £22m just days before the deadline for firms to register is not enough to make it fit for purpose in its current form.
It also does not add to the growing problem of e-waste once it reaches the end of its life in the way that solar panels and batteries currently do.
Prof Di Lorenzo said: "The principle is that hydrocarbons are digested by the organisms in the soil into less or totally non-harmful components and in doing so they release electrons."
She added: "Once again we generate electricity with that and in this way we achieve two things - we purify contaminated soil and you generate electricity at the same time."
It could prove transformative for places like the Niger Delta in southern Nigeria, which repeated oil spills have turned into one of the most polluted landscapes on earth.
"The technology is extremely low-cost and it could be a solution to areas like Nigeria that don't necessarily have access to really expensive treatments," Prof Di Lorenzo said.
"Also the amount of energy can be used to make the overall process self-powered and self-sustaining, or maybe to power some devices such as sensors placed there to monitor the progress of the treatment."
"SMFCs only generate a tiny amount of electricity but together with other renewable technologies hopefully they can help us to phase out fossil fuels," Prof Di Lorenzo said.
To meet the UK's climate change targets, the government wants to install 600,000 low-carbon heat pumps annually within five years - currently only 50,000 are installed annually.
Heat pumps use electricity to run and are three times more efficient than a gas boiler, so as we switch to renewable electricity homes will be cheaper to heat and produce less emissions.
The government's own research from Autumn 2022 shows 80% of people in the UK did not know what a heat pump was, let alone were aware of the scheme.
A government spokesperson told the BBC: "We've recently launched a marketing campaign to further increase public awareness and will consider options to ensure our targets are met."
John Taylor, 71, another recipient of the BUS voucher, also said the government needed to make it clearer which installers to use: "I searched online and found cowboys out there.
The committee said the government is funding some training places for installers but needed to give more certainty to engineers that it is worth investing their time in getting retrained.
He said that model was not new and was already being used in Scotland, where they also offer a free energy advice service to help households navigate installing a new heating system.
Countries like France and Germany have also pledged twice as much money to their low carbon heating schemes and offer larger grants for low-income households up to £9,700 to make heat pumps more affordable.
The UK government wants a new power station where carbon dioxide is captured and stored under the North Sea - either in old oil and gas reservoirs, or permeable rocks known as saline aquifers.
Carbon capture power stations are seen as part of the solution, along with the increased use of nuclear energy, and other rapidly-evolving technologies such as hydrogen.
The other largest sectors - transport, residential, energy supply, business, and land use, land use change and forestry - have shown a decrease in that time.
The report said the downward trend was mainly driven by the energy supply sector, as electricity generation moves away from using fossil fuels and switches to using more gas and renewable generation.
They are projected to decrease by 8% from 2020 to 2031, largely driven by the expected increase in electric vehicles and changes in carbon dioxide regulations for vehicles.
Michael Benfield, who helped set up the new political movement in the 1970s, said he believed the "battle for the world's environmental survival" was "at this moment, lost".
Speaking at an event to mark the party's 50th anniversary, Mr Benfield told the BBC he had become "somewhat of a doomsayer" about efforts to protect the environment.
"It doesn't mean to say that we can't perhaps do other things to put things right, but it's a very dire situation that we have," Mr Benfield said.
The group was formed in a Coventry pub by Mr Benfield, fellow estate agent Freda Sanders and solicitors Lesley Whittaker and her late husband Tony.
The three surviving founders of what would turn out to be Europe's first green political party were among those who gathered at the London School of Economics to mark the milestone.
"I think that's the vital space the party occupies today, which is both that vision for a hopeful future and tangible real-life examples of where we're making change," he said.
AK Saseendran, wildlife minister in Kerala, was reported as saying that his government may consider solutions including sterilisation or culling to check tiger numbers in the state.
By then, his comments had set off a discussion on wildlife conservation, with several experts expressing outrage and pointing out that culling was a "legally untenable" suggestion.
A federal wildlife protection law, implemented in 1972, makes it virtually illegal to kill or capture tigers - designated India's national animal - even when they are involved in such conflicts.
But the minister told the BBC that the suggestion on culling came from locals who had attended a meeting with all the political parties to discuss a way out.
Dr Ullas Karanth, a conservationist and tiger expert, told the BBC that over the past 50 years, the population of tigers had only increased by a thousand, far less than capacity.
Praveen Bhargav, a former member of the National Board for Wildlife, said that a recently amended section of the national Wildlife Act does not permit declaration of tigers "as vermin".
But the suggestion to cull tigers found some support from reputed environmentalist Madhav Gadgil, who told The New Indian Express newspaper that India should allow "rational hunting" of animals to check their numbers.
Hampshire Constabulary said the bird initially tested positive for avian influenza and also had rodenticides in its system, but neither factor was found to have caused its death.
A police investigation into another sea eagle found dead in north Dorset in January 2022 was ended after no one person could be proved criminally responsible.
The Isle of Wight was chosen to reintroduce white-tailed eagles, also known as sea eagles, as it offers an ideal habitat with plenty of fish in its surrounding waters for them to feed on.
There is a robotic scraper - it helps reduce emissions from cows waste by removing it from the open air more quickly and regularly than can be done by hand.
"The problem with cauliflowers is, between losing them in the dry weather in the summertime and the frost in the wintertime, you maybe only have 70% cut," Stephen says.
"So, with price pressure from supermarkets - quality, you know - we basically dropped the cauliflowers in the really cold weather and the really hot weather, but we're back to a 12-month programme now."
Regardless of which of the climate bills currently progressing through Stormont crosses the legislative line first, agriculture is in the crosshairs for targets to reduce the emissions it produces.
"We have floods regularly and I have never seen this amount of rubbish brought down with the water, the actual branches have been totally covered in plastic."
The definition of "green space" in the UK includes any land with vegetation on it - it could be a playing field, a disused railway line or an allotment.
World Wildlife Fund production policy head Alec Taylor said: "Access to green space is without doubt vital - but when that space is polluted or devoid of nature, it doesn't mean much."
The government has now set out how it intends to meet legally-binding targets on water quality, biodiversity and waste as well as international targets agreed at the COP15 UN biodiversity summit in December.
Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton, has raised separate concerns about how the plans to get people back into nature could affect farmers in the UK.
"At the moment nearly three million people live more than 10 minutes from green space and any new access would be needed to be protected in perpetuity," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Plans for climate-friendly flying rest on creating greener jet fuels that have less impact on the environment.
Switching to sustainable fuel is also key to the government's aim to reach "jet zero" flying by 2050.
But the Royal Society concludes there is currently no single, clear alternative to traditional fuel.
Flying is responsible for 2.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 8% of UK emissions.
London Heathrow is the largest global user of biofuels but it accounts for just 0.5% of the airport's fuel.
However the UK currently does not generate enough renewable electricity to make enough green hydrogen.
The authors say it remains unclear exactly how much each alternative fuel would reduce the climate impacts of flying.
(16:20 GMT - This story has been updated to add a response from the UK airline industry trade body)
Zero Waste Scotland's carbon metric report tracks the full lifecycle impact of items thrown away by Scottish homes.
The report looked at the emissions generated by the products Scottish households consume and then throw away.
It also looked at the emissions from the disposal of household waste items through landfill or incineration.
The textiles category included clothing, shoes and carpets - with clothes and shoes accounting for about 80%.
Izzie Eriksen is the founder of the ApparelXchange social enterprise, based in the southside of Glasgow.
Its stylish shop sells second-hand clothes that come from donations, school drives or lost property.
Zero Waste Scotland said the increase in textile waste was the main contributor to this.
The clothes we wear can have a huge impact on the climate, even more so than the aviation industry.
Most of our textiles, particularly clothes, are made abroad and emissions are attributed to the country of manufacture.
But the scale of the problem is not insignificant and, since we're creating the demand, really it's our problem.
And think how much pressure there is for us cut down the amount of time we spend in the air.
Changes have been announced to the plans for a deposit return scheme for cans and bottles in Scotland.
But opposition parties still want the plans put on hold so they can be reviewed.
The Scottish Conservatives claimed the "last-minute" changes were an acknowledgment that its design was flawed.
Firms producing fewer than 25,000 units a year will also be given the option of using stick-on barcodes.
Mr Golden said a well-designed scheme could be beneficial, but that in its current form it was unworkable.
Scientists are harnessing the microorganisms in soil to generate electricity that could one day help decontaminate polluted landscapes.
They are soon to launch a start-up to bring soil microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) to a commercial market.
"All we do is capture those electrons so we can make electricity out of them," she told BBC West.
Closer to home, the planned start-up will initially focus on "smart" agriculture applications.
The government's flagship green heating scheme has been described as "seriously failing" by a Lords inquiry.
The Boiler Upgrade Scheme grants households £5,000 to help switch from a gas boiler to a low-carbon heat pump.
The government responded by saying it would launch a marketing campaign to make people more aware of the scheme.
Anthony Hibbs got a heat pump installed in his new-build home in Newcastle-under-Lyme through the scheme last year.
There is not a lot of guidance leading you to decent people - you are on your own."
There are an estimated 3,000 heat pump installers in the UK compared to 130,000 registered gas heating engineers.
She said: "Government and business need to work together on this, we hope the grant will continue.
Even with the grant, Mr Taylor and Mr Hibbs spent £8,500 and £6,000 respectively on their heat pumps.
It is not going to be acceptable if the underspend in the first year somehow disappears back to the treasury.
The UK government is set to announce where a ground-breaking power station will be built.
Carbon capture power plants are part of the government's commitment to remove carbon from UK electricity production by 2035.
It hopes to build at least one by the mid 2020s, although that deadline now looks improbable.
There are three proposals under consideration: one at Keadby in north Lincolnshire and two near Redcar on Teesside.
All would require the construction of a pipeline to transport the captured CO2 under the North Sea for storage.
The amount being captured at these proposed power stations is very small by comparison.
None of the three proposed carbon capture plants claims to capture more than two million tonnes a year.
The government has set a target to capture between 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030.
The cost of a new gas power station at Keadby, providing electricity for nearly a million homes, is £350m.
The cost of renewable energy for example has plummeted in the last decade.
The only carbon capture power station currently operating is a coal-fired plant at Boundary Dam in western Canada.
Agriculture remains Northern Ireland's highest-emitting sector, new figures from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs show.
Overall, Northern Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 24% between 1990 and 2020.
Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which include carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from escaping into space.
The inventory estimated 2020 emissions to be 21m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e).
This was a 24% decrease on the 28 MtCO2e emitted in the 1990 base year.
The sector contributed 16% of emissions in 2020, and is predicted to have a similar share (17%) in 2031.
The battle for the world's environmental survival is, at this moment, lost," he said.
In a speech to the gathering, Green MP Caroline Lucas, warned: "We don't have another 50 years."
An Indian state minister's comments on culling tigers has sparked a debate on conservation.
He was speaking amid outrage over the death of a farmer in a tiger attack.
The minister later told the BBC he only repeated a suggestion from locals regarding culling tigers.
The attack in Kerala took place on 13 January in the Mananthavady forest range in Wayanad district.
After his death, angry locals protested against forest officials and demanded that the tiger be killed.
Local media reported that Mr Saseendran had mooted culling as a possible solution to the issue.
"So the suggestion to cull tigers to reduce their numbers is not a sound idea," he says.
In large parts of eastern and north-east India, tigers are virtually extinct because of excessive hunting of prey and tigers.
If tigers enter human habitats and prey on livestock, authorities should immediately pay compensation, he says.
No other country protects wild animals outside of its national parks," Mr Gadgil said, according to the report.
An investigation into the death of a white-tailed eagle has found no evidence of unlawful killing.
The satellite-tracked eagle was found dead on Bowcombe Road, on the Isle of Wight, in February 2022.
A police statement said specialist post-mortem examinations found the cause to death to be "uncertain".
The birds are all fitted with GPS tracking devices, allowing their flight paths to be monitored.
They are the UK's largest bird of prey, with a wingspan of up to 8ft (2.5m).
County Tyrone farmer says her industry is trying to offset its greenhouse gas emissions
But it's also Northern Ireland's biggest producer of greenhouse gases (GHG) - responsible for 27% of emissions.
"I think we need to be given credit for what we do to sequester carbon," says Jessica Pollock.
But we also sequester a lot of carbon, so this needs to be accounted for."
She has introduced some green measures since taking over her family farm after returning from university.
And the farm itself is powered by a water turbine she installed, along with solar panels on the outbuildings.
"This is not about reducing and destroying the beef and dairy herd, but we have to recognise the science."
"It's just at what speed and they're capability to do it with the profit margins they have."
Stormont MLAs have agreed to move Northern Ireland's first ever climate bill to the next stage.
The bill sets a 2045 net zero greenhouse gas emissions target for Northern Ireland.
It does not specify the level of reductions required in various sectors like agriculture, transport and energy.
The bill would also create the role of Climate Commissioner to oversee progress against those targets.
As the sector which emits most greenhouse gases, the farming sector fears it will be disproportionately affected.
It said that would be a fair contribution to a wider UK net zero target.
Mr Poots claimed his policy proposals were being held up by Sinn Féin at the Executive.
Sinn Féin, Alliance, the SDLP, the Green Party, Ulster Unionists, and several independents back the bill.
They have been out litter-picking every day for weeks to try and clear the area of sanitary waste.
"The plastic in the river is really not going to be good for the wildlife at all."
Byron Baker-Brown, who owns Channel Kayaks, saw his business premises completely carpeted in debris following the floods.
He said the local community had been hiring kayaks just to help with the clean-up effort.
"Individuals need to take more responsibility for what they are sending down toilets," he said.
Everyone will live within 15 minutes' walk of a green space or water under new government plans to restore nature.
Habitat for wildlife will be expanded and there will be 25 new or enlarged national nature reserves.
More money will go to protecting rare wildlife, such as hedgehogs and red squirrels.
The Ordnance Survey mapping agency estimates 28% of people live further than 15 minutes away from their nearest public park.
The government promised in 2018 to leave the environment in a better state for future generations.
The post-Brexit green watchdog warned the country was facing a "deeply concerning decline in biodiversity".
Green groups have been calling for a "quantum shift" in action and ambition on restoring nature.
Yet, the latest figures show key animals and plants declined by 82% between 1970 and 2018.
The pine marten was once found across the UK, but has declined dramatically due to deforestation and hunting.
The government is setting up a multi-million pound Species Survival Fund to protect and restore habitats.
Some researchers say it's the second greatest environmental risk to health in Western Europe.
It's not just Birmingham, this model can be applied to any town or city.
Giving it a cash value will help make the case for even more new tree planting to come.
It also accuses zoo authorities of mistreating the animal - the BBC contacted officials but they declined to comment.
They are everywhere, in temples, in private ownership and are embedded in our history," she said.
Animal rights activists have long advocated for more humane treatment of India's captive elephants, which live in dismal conditions.
Many, owned by private individuals, are used for religious processions, logging activities and sometimes even begging.
Shankar wasn't always alone - he came to India in 1998 with a companion, Bombai.
Zoo officials have said they don't know where in Africa the elephants are from.
For some years, Shankar and Bombai seemed content enough at the zoo, touching, nuzzling and smelling each other.
These gases warm the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change.
It concluded that none could replace fossil jet fuel in the short term.
Some airlines now use very small amounts of biofuel, largely made from crops.
Another option is fuel made from hydrogen produced with green electricity.
Another major barrier is that existing plane engines cannot use hydrogen-based fuel.
Environmental campaigners say the government must also encourage people to fly less.
The environmental body said Scots "need to rethink our consumption of goods".
Each of these steps will create greenhouse gases in the country of production.
It's an environmental imperative that we turn this around."
Concerns had been raised about the impact of the recycling programme on small businesses.
Circularity Scotland announced £22m of cashflow support to remove upfront charges from some companies.
A 20p deposit will be added to cost of items sold in Scotland.
They will then be invoiced for deposits and fees.
Producers will also be given two months' credit terms for payments.
The researchers hope SMFCs can help the world end its reliance on fossil fuels.
"It's an exceptionally simple device," Prof Di Lorenzo said.
She told the BBC: "The scheme isn't working as well as it needs to.
He told the BBC his new heating system was "absolutely brilliant".
It wasn't easy at first and I have never seen the scheme advertised as such."
The government declined to comment on what would happen to this unspent funding.
The money was set aside for a good purpose."
In 2021, the UK emitted 425 million tonnes of CO2.
That's fallen by almost 50% since 1990.
That could involve other industrial processes as well as power generation.
The technology has been around for decades.
There are no such plans to use the CO2 from the new proposed power stations.
The hope is that the price might fall over time.
The latest Greenhouse Gas Inventory details emissions in 2020.
Agriculture was responsible for 28% of local emissions in 2020.
Compared to the base year of 1990, that is a rise of 7%.
From the base year to 2020, transport emissions decreased by 2%.
"I'll say to you now that it's too late.
The focus now, he thought, would have to be on mitigation.
A medical report said that his wounds had caused "excessive bleeding".
"The proposal of the forest minister is legally not tenable," Bhargav said.
"But in 90% of tiger forests there is no such problem.
We should not lose sight of this basic fact," he says.
"India is the lone country having legislation for protecting wild animals.
I think it is irrational, foolish, unconstitutional and nothing to be proud of.

All these innovations cost money.
"It's very difficult to implement strategies without being profitable on farms."
But one expert says innovations are only a part of the puzzle.
Stephen Murdock can see the science in his fields.
He grows vegetables near Comber and is in a race to harvest his broccoli.
It's a different issue with some of the other brassicas he grows.
Elsewhere in his fields, the water lies - drowning cauliflowers that will go unpicked.

It's something Jessica has mixed feelings about.
"What is good for the environment is often good for farms too," she says.
"I do think it's very important that every farm is progressing.
It establishes a legal framework including five-year plans for emissions cuts.
Those would come later, be set by Executive departments and require assembly approval.
It is opposed by farmers, Agriculture minister Edwin Poots and his DUP party.
Mr Poots told MLAs it would be "extremely detrimental to our economy".
Bill sponsor Clare Bailey said there was nothing in it which "harms farming".
The DUP and Jim Allister of the TUV oppose it.
Water companies must also keep sewage out of the water, rowers say.
It is going to take a long time," he added.
Access to green spaces varies considerably across the UK and for different groups.
The ambitions of the Environmental Improvement Plan include:
The plan also looks at restoring natural habitats.
"We need to think on a landscape scale," he said.
"There is no magic bullet, but by modernising airspace to make flying more efficient, by introducing new zero emission technology like hydrogen aircraft and by upscaling the use of sustainable aviation fuels this decade, it can be achieved," it said in a statement.
Regarding the Royal Society's assertion that sufficiently supplying the UK aviation industry with sustainable fuels would put pressure on food supplies, Airlines UK said the UK had sufficient feedstocks, that they would be drawn initially from household, commercial, agricultural and forestry waste and waste industrial gases, and that they did not compete with food crops.
"Decarbonising aviation is undoubtedly a challenge, and the sector is working closely with government on ways to accelerate the transition and maximise both the environmental and huge economic opportunities from leading the 'jet zero' transition,"Airlines UK said.
"Not all aspects of modern life in Western nations have an easy 'technofix' for the damage they do to the environment, and nowhere is this truer than for air travel," suggests Leo Murray, director of innovation at climate charity Possible.
"We're trying to encourage people to go second hand - part of that is the experience they have when they come in, things are well displayed, it meets quality standards and the pricing and labelling so it's really easy to find.
Mr Gulland added: "The circular economy gives us the opportunity do things differently without compromising on quality of life, evolving an economy that's better for both people and planet in which goods and materials are valued and made to last."
Circularity Scotland, a private non-profit company set up to administer the DRS, has now said firms selling fewer than three million units a year will not have to pay deposits and fees for the first month of the scheme.
"Instead of this desperate bid to save face, Lorna Slater should swallow her pride and accept that the scheme should be paused at once for an independent review to address the numerous concerns of business."
In 2019, the team conducted a pilot in a semi-arid fishing village in the north east of Brazil which is reliant on water stored from the rainy season for use throughout the rest of the year.
Water can be made safe using an electrochemical reactor that generates oxidants to purify the water through the application of a current, but this can be problematic for remote communities because it requires a reliable source of energy.
The University of Bath team has successfully powered the reactor through a stack of MFCs, and their latest version of the technology is able to purify enough water per day to meet the needs of a family of five.
But in her letter to the government, Baroness Parminter, chair of the Lords Committee, heavily criticised ministers for not doing more to raise awareness of the scheme - which is on track to issue just half of the allocated grants.
The problems with the scheme are reminiscent of the government's previous Green Homes Grant which was meant to support households with energy efficiency measures like insulation, but was scrapped after less than a year in 2021 for lack of installers.
But Rebecca Dibb-Simkin, Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Octopus Energy, which was praised by the Committee for its investment in heat pump design and training, said the scheme had boosted confidence in the industry and Octopus Energy has 50,000 people on its waiting list for a heat pump.
The committee has said that for lower- and middle-income households the grant is not enough, and they are being put off by the higher upfront costs of installing a heat pump compared to a gas boiler.
Stew Horne, head of policy at The Energy Savings Trust told the BBC: "That upfront cost is a real issue, and policy has to focus on addressing that... through grants or low-cost loans or through green finance."
The Lords Committee for Environment and Climate Change said the government needed to expand the programme to match this scale and also guarantee that the unspent funding from Year 1 of the BUS - which they estimate at about £75m - would roll over to subsequent years.
There has been a big expansion in renewable energy in the last decade - in particular the use of offshore wind - but the unresolved question is how to keep the lights on when the wind isn't blowing.
"These power stations look like another excuse for the government to show preference to their friends in the oil and gas industry, making energy more expensive to everyone else's disadvantage," says Dr Doug Parr of campaign group Greenpeace UK.
"The climate and nature crises are more critical than ever, and it feels to me that what falls upon the shoulders of the Green Party is a most extraordinary responsibility but an awesome opportunity as well."
Deputy leader of the Green Party of England and Wales Zack Polanski said it was "vital" to be "honest about the urgency of the situation", but cautioned against underestimating "the importance of hope alongside practical action".
There is, however, a provision in the law "in case of serious human-wildlife conflict", where a state's chief wildlife warden can allow a tiger to be hunted "after being satisfied that it cannot be tranquilised or translocated", he added.
"Standard toxicology testing was not possible due to the avian influenza positive test, but the limited analysis that was undertaken did reveal elevated background levels of two rodenticides, brodifacoum and difenacoum, though not at sufficiently high levels to have caused the death of the bird," it said.
"We're going to have to shift to where we're subsidising farmers to sequester carbon, to pay them to re-wet bogs and peatlands, and there's some experiments already going on, to plant native trees because this sucks out carbon from the atmosphere.
Vice-captain of The Minerva Bath Road Rowing Club Ian Burdiss said: "The state of the river is as bad as I have ever seen it and I have been rowing for 40 years, 30 of them in Bath.
Jules Taylor, one of the rowers who has joined the clean up effort, said: "The rubbish just makes rowing really unpleasant, we are quite low in the water and you can smell it and things get in your oars as well."
"This plan provides the blueprint for how we deliver our commitment to leave our environment in a better state than we found it, making sure we drive forward progress with renewed ambition and achieve our target of not just halting, but reversing the decline of nature," he said.
In 2020, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported black people in England were nearly four times less likely than white to have access to outdoor space at home, whether it be a private or shared garden, a patio or a balcony.
In 2020, the government adviser for the natural environment, Natural England, found "that people who live in neighbourhoods with greater amounts of green infrastructure tend to be happier, healthier and live longer lives than those who live in less green places".
The Wildlife Trusts Chief executive Craig Bennett said the plans must ensure "the whole of government is acting to halt the chronic loss of nature and tackle this existential threat to our prosperity, our ability to produce food, and to have enough clean water".
One lesson for how to turn around the fortunes of some of the UK's native wildlife comes from conservation efforts to protect the pine marten, a small woodland mammal that is making a return to southern Britain.
"The pine marten is a good example of how a species can recover if people stop killing them, you provide more habitat and you direct conservation efforts," said Lizzie Croose of the Vincent Wildlife Trust.
David Fletcher from the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology has come up with a model that looks at the trees in a city and turns their noise reducing benefits into a cash value based on the impact on our health.
He would be the first to admit reducing a beautiful urban park to just a cash value can seem crass, but when you do that of course it allows the people holding the purse strings to compare the financial benefits of trees to other options properly for the first time.
You may be hoping that guilt-free flying is just around the corner, but scientists warn it is still a long way off.
To produce enough to supply the UK aviation industry would require half of Britain's farming land, putting pressure on food supplies, the Royal Society says.
Ammonia and synthetic fuels are also under consideration, but they need even more green hydrogen and it is unclear if existing planes could use them.
But they stress that in the long term a successful alternative fuel will probably be developed, but that airplanes and airports will need to be re-designed.
They are calling for more research into sustainable aviation fuel, suggesting that the UK could become a global leader if it invested in solving the problem.
His organisation wants the government to tax frequent flyers, the small number of people who take around 70% of flights from UK airports.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: "The UK's Sustainable Aviation Fuels programme is one of the most comprehensive in the world.
Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Hydrogen are key elements of this, and we will ensure that there is no impact on food crops."
Textiles such as clothing and shoes are the most environmentally-damaging type of household waste in Scotland, according to a new study.
This included the extraction of the raw materials which make up those products and the manufacturing of them - processes which often happen abroad.
This might include the production of the yarn or the fabric and then the manufacture of the finished product, such as washing and dying.
There was a slight overall increase in the total carbon footprint of Scottish household waste, rising by 0.9% on last year.
"The average Scot consumes more than twice the sustainable amount of materials per year, and our throwaway culture encourages that approach.
This is a problem which is hidden from official statistics since we only count greenhouse gases emitted on our own shores.
The body set up to run the scheme - due to go live in August - has now announced extra support for small firms.
The deposit gets passed down the chain, eventually to the customer who pays 20p more for the bottle or can.
The customer gets this back when they hand the used container in at a return point, either over the counter, or using a reverse vending machine.
Retailers will act as return points - and will reimburse customers from their own funds, but can claim this back from the scheme's administrator.
Circular Economy Minister Lorna Slater said she hoped the changes would address many concerns raised by smaller producers such as craft brewers.
She said: "It addresses initial cash flow challenges, and provides a pragmatic and simple solution to the issues raised around barcodes for smaller product lines.
"This is a package that gives businesses the clarity and confidence they need to be part of Scotland's deposit return scheme."
A team at the University of Bath has already used the clean technology to help remote communities in Brazil purify their water supply.
Mirella Di Lorenzo, a professor of biochemical engineering, explained how microorganisms generate electrons as they break down organic matter in soil.
SMFCs only generate tiny amounts of electricity, but unlike established renewable technologies it does not rely on materials that are difficult or unsustainable to source.
Prof Di Lorenzo said its advantage was how cheap the material is and also the fact it needs very little maintenance once set up.
The community usually uses chloride to disinfect the water, which can cause health problems such as vomiting and diarrhoea when consumed in large amounts.
Elsewhere, the team has funding from the European Commission for a project to use MFC technology to decontaminate fossil fuel pollutants in soil.
These include sensors to monitor soil health and allow growers to tailor fertiliser application and minimise pesticide use to improve sustainability.
On Wednesday, the Lords Climate Change Committee said grant take-up is so low the national target for green heating is "very unlikely to be met".
Heating in UK homes produces nearly 17% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for climate change.
The Boiler Upgrade Scheme was meant to kick-start the heat pump industry in England and Wales, and reduce the cost of installation for homeowners.
It is absolutely critical that the government boosts public awareness... we need to give people the confidence to know about why these changes are important."
But he said finding information on installers and the scheme was difficult: "I had to look online and do a lot of research.
"We know we can generate demand, and the grant would help people with the cost… it's kind of a perfect relationship."
Baroness Parminter told the BBC she had made it very clear to government: "They have got to get that money back.
The carbon capture plant is designed to stop most of the carbon dioxide (CO2) it produces being released into the atmosphere.
Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits CO2, which is the main driver of climate change.
The carbon capture process stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either re-uses it or stores it underground.
It's mainly been used in industries where captured CO2 can be reused, for example to force out oil and gas from underground reserves.
Catherine Raw of energy company SSE told the BBC that building a similar sized gas power station with carbon capture would roughly double the cost.
There are those who see carbon capture as too expensive and believe the money would be better spent on renewables and power storage (like batteries).
In September 2022 there were just 30 carbon capture facilities in the world, according to a report from the Global CCS Institute.
Almost all of these are attached to industrial plants carrying out activities such as natural gas processing or fertiliser production.
Once built, it is hoped other industries would use the UK power station's pipeline to store CO2 under the North Sea.
However, several carbon capture gas power stations similar to those proposed in the UK are in development, mostly in the US.
It says agriculture is the only sector to have shown an increase since the base year of 1990, with all other sectors reducing their emissions.
The emissions estimates in this report cover seven greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.
Based on the projections released on Thursday, agriculture is expected to see a decrease of just 1% between 2020 and 2031.
But its share of emissions is projected to rise to 32% by 2031, as "other sectors reduce emissions at a faster rate".
Over the coming years, emissions are expected to decrease year-on-year, with an overall estimated reduction of 13% by 2031.
It added that the business sector will contribute almost a third of (31%) the overall reduction in emissions from 2020 to 2031.
The residential sector's emissions have fallen by 23% between 1990 and 2020, with a decrease of 24% expected between 2020 and 2031.
And energy supply emissions have decreased by almost half (46%), with a slower rate of reduction anticipated from 2020 to 2031.
WATCH: Green Party co-founder Michael Benfield tells the BBC that the battle for the world's environmental survival is now lost.
One of the founders of what would become the Green Party of England and Wales has declared "it's too late" to save the environment.
"I think we have succeeded in helping to educate... but we have failed in dealing with the battle for environmental survival.
The scale of the solutions which he believed were necessary would be simply too unpalatable for any political party to propose, he argues.
He was speaking 50 years since the first public meeting of PEOPLE, which would become the Ecology Party in 1975 and the Green Party in 1985.
She said: "We are living through maybe one of the most consequential decades of human history, which I appreciate is a very big thing to say.
India is home to more than 70% of the world's tigers - according to the most recent government estimate, the numbers stand at 2,976.
But their habitats haven't expanded at the same rate, forcing so-called "surplus" tigers to move outside protected reserves and come in conflict with humans.
The victim, 50, sustained serious injuries to his hands and legs and died of a cardiac arrest while being transferred from one hospital to another.
"We have to find a solution to control the animals... I am not in a hurry to cull," he said.
Dr Karanth said that sometimes problems do arise in a few tiger habitats where there is a high density of the animals.
And if they become man-eaters, they should be "immediately killed", Dr Karanth adds, calling it "damage control in specific instances".
The bird was part of an ongoing conservation project, run by Forestry England and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation.
Both organisations were involved in an investigation into the bird's death lead by Hampshire Constabulary, after it was found dead on 24 February.
It urged users of rodenticides - particularly brodifacoum which is known to be highly toxic to wildlife - to always follow user guidelines.
The white-tailed eagle project started in 2019 and sees at least six birds released annually on the Isle of Wight.
Data from the trackers has shown they explore widely, with some making it to the north of Scotland, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark.
The industry is feeling the pressure to reduce that amount, while also calling for the work it does to protect the environment to be recognised.
The land in Northern Ireland is mostly suited to raising meat and dairy, but cows produce methane in large quantities.
"There's very few other industries that can sequester carbon, so I think from that perspective, yes, cows do emit a lot of methane.
"Making sure the farm is profitable to sustain that until that can make a profit for you is necessary," she says.
"Farmers are the stewards of the land, they have particular challenges," says John Barry, professor of green economics at Queen's University Belfast.
"We should finish cutting broccoli middle-November, but we're here just past the middle of October and all the broccoli is ready."
They voted 58 to 29 in favour after more than six hours of debate, meaning the proposed legislation will proceed to detailed scrutiny at the assembly.
She said the goal was to see farms of all sizes thrive, not see the industry continue to contract and consolidate.
The minister is drawing up his own legislation which draws on a recommendation from an advisory body to government on climate.
The Climate Change Committee said it suggested a reduction of at least 82% in emissions by 2050 given Northern Ireland's economic reliance on agriculture.
Ulster Unionist Roy Beggs said he could not support the bill but would back one reflecting the recommendations of the Climate Change Committee.
Rowers are pleading with the public to stop flushing hygiene products after huge volumes of litter washed into the River Avon during January's floods.
One rower said he had seen branches "totally covered in plastic" as volunteers used rakes to retrieve potentially hazardous rubbish.
She added: "It's not great, there's a lot of wildlife out here, we see otters, we see birds, there's a lot of fish.
"When you look at it today it doesn't look too bad, that's because of the efforts of a lot of people," he said.
"We've been doing this for a couple of weeks now, clearing, and there's quite a few weeks left to do.
Mr Baker-Brown said litter pickers were being encouraged to wear personal protective equipment such as face masks because of the potentially toxic material they were collecting.
"I think the companies that are managing that waste need to look very closely at what they are allowing into the rivers," he added.
The research team looked at hundreds of previous studies on the benefits of physical activity and concluded that even doing half the recommended amount could prevent one in 20 cases of cardiovascular disease and nearly one in 30 cases of cancer.
Not everyone finds it easy to do the exercise recommended by the NHS - two out of three people say they do less than 150 mins (2.5 hours) of moderate exercise and fewer than one in 10 manage more than 300 mins (five hours) per week.
Some 3,000 firms operate 10,000 pharmaceutical factories making generics (copies of branded medicines that usually sell for a fraction of their price), over-the-counter medicines, vaccines and ingredients in what is one of the world's largest drug-making countries.
In 2013, after a seven-year long investigation, top Indian drug maker Ranbaxy Laboratories was ordered to pay a record $500m fine in the US, the biggest handed down to a generic drug maker for improper manufacturing, storing and testing of drugs.
Official government records reveal that between 2007 and 2020, more than 7,500 drugs sampled in just three of India's 28 states and three union territories had failed quality tests and had been declared drugs "not of standard quality" or inferior, research by Dinesh Thakur, a former Indian drug executive-turned-public health expert, found.
"The total number of patients affected by such inferior drugs possibly runs into hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions over the last decade," says Mr Thakur, co-author of The Truth Pill, a piercing look at drug regulation in India.
He believes that the DEG-related incidents had occurred at home - and now abroad - because some firms "quite often fail to test either the raw materials or the final formulation before shipping it to the market".
"Given the sheer quality of drugs detected as "not of standard quality" over the last decade from the open market it is obvious that a large number of manufacturing facilities are completely flouting quality and process control procedures that form the core of 'good manufacturing practices'" says Mr Thakur.
Dr Rahul Baxi, a Mumbai-based diabetologist, told me that only once in recent years he became suspicious about a drug when glucose levels of a patient shot up after he switched off from branded drug to a cheaper generic.
"Many of my patients that come from far flung parts of India buy six months of prescribed drugs from pharmacies in the city because they say they don't trust drugs available in their areas," Dr Baxi said.
Alice Wiseman, Gateshead director of public health, said a report in 2020 showed that, while life expectancy across the UK had stalled, it had started getting shorter for those in the bottom 10% income bracket in the North East.
Nel Huws, 23, from Clwb Pêl-droed y Felinheli football club, said: "It doesn't even cross my mind sometimes that there are no facilities, because you just become so used to the fact that there aren't any.
"The Welsh government has been thinking about its period dignity plan - actually, how can we factor in providing funding, providing facilities for clubs, that are maybe struggling but can see that this is quite a wide issue across Wales, across multiple sports?"
According to the body's assistant director, Owen Hathway, ensuring sufficient facilities for women is essential "not just to address the issue of women and girls' participation around their period, but also their participation in general and feeling like they're a part of the sport sector in Wales".
The Welsh government said: "Since 2018 we have invested around £12m to ensure that children and young people and those on low incomes have access to free period products, as well as committing £24m in capital funding over the next three years to Sport Wales to develop facilities across Wales.
Dr Catherine Sharp from Public Health Wales said the survey is still in its pilot stage, but seeks to ask members of the public for their opinions on a range of topics, which in turn could shape future policies.
"In order for us to understand what we should be doing, what direction we should be travelling in, we need to understand what the public's view is, and how we can help to work with them to shift patterns.
The treatments can help those with depression, anxiety, PTSD and body dysmorphia and are centred on the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) - a talking therapy which can help a patient manage their problems by suggesting alterations to their thought process and behaviour.
Using a series of modules on topics related to depression, online programmes such as Beating the Blues and Deprexis offer worksheets and exercises to help people better understand their mental health problems, alongside techniques for changing their behaviour or thinking patterns.
Professor Dame Til Wykes, of the School of Mental Health and Psychological Sciences at London's King's College, cautioned "we don't know enough" about the effectiveness of online therapies and whether the therapies will offer sufficient support for mental health patients.
The content manager for mental health charity Mind, Jessica D'Cruz, told the BBC: "We're always pleased to see innovation in mental health therapies that can help people have greater choice in how they are supported, and allow all of us to find a therapy that works for ourselves.
"It's also important to remember that with the ongoing underfunding of NHS mental health services, and the issues many services are experiencing in the wake of pressures from the pandemic and cost of living crisis, the majority of people in need of mental health support will struggle to benefit from this.
A study of 200 cancer patients with cancer-therapy-induced cardiomyopathy, or CCM, by Imperial College London researchers has pinpointed the genetic risk factors, paving the way for testing of patients before they start chemotherapy to find out who is at risk.
"Doctors need to be more proactive about asking their patients what else they are taking when they are being treated for cancer," Prof Cardoso, head breast surgeon at the Champalimaud Cancer Centre in Lisbon, Portugal, told the BBC.
Grete Brauten-Smith, clinical nurse specialist at charity Breast Cancer Now said: "With a lot of unproven information available online and little reliable research into these products, a discussion with a healthcare professional can ensure a patient has the accurate information they need to make an informed choice."
Martin Ledwick, head cancer information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: "Doctors should be aware of this research as it suggests cancer patients need to be monitored more closely after treatment, for heart disease and stroke.
Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said the study offered further evidence that, compared with the general population, cancer survivors are at much greater risk of death from heart and circulatory diseases.
KK Harshina, 31, says she lived with unbearable pain in her stomach for years, that is until a scan last year showed that a pair of forceps had been left inside her body during a surgery.
It found if everyone did as little as 11 minutes of daily activity, one in 10 premature deaths could be prevented.
That equates to 75 minutes per week - or 11 minutes per day - riding a bike, walking fast, hiking, dancing or playing tennis.
"You should feel yourself moving, your heart will beat faster but you won't necessarily feel out of breath," says Dr Soren Brage, who led the research.
Doing that amount is enough to reduce the risk of developing heart disease and stroke by 17% and cancer by 7%, the findings suggest.
Regular exercise reduces body fat and blood pressure while also improving fitness, sleep and heart health in the long run.
"If you find that 75 minutes a week is manageable, then you could try stepping it up gradually to the full recommended amount."
Getting enjoyable activities into your weekly routine is the best way to increase the amount of physical activity you do, they say.
In the winter of 2019, a number of children living in India's Jammu region began falling sick with what many thought was a mysterious illness.
By the time the mystery was solved, 11 children, aged between two months and six years, had died.
The tainted drugs and the tragic deaths again shone a spotlight on India's $42bn - half of the revenues come from exports - drug manufacturing industry.
Although India imports 70% of the active ingredient chemicals for its medicines from China, it is trying to make more of them at home.
India's traditional expertise in making generics has helped make it a formidable low-cost maker of drugs and become a global manufacturing base.
Some 40% of over-the-counter and generic medicines sold in the US and a quarter of all medicines dispensed in the UK come from India.
Outside the USA, India has the most number of drug making plants - 800 - that are compliant with the US health and safety requirements.
Many believe that India has always battled a flood of counterfeit drugs, mostly sold in small towns and villages.
But analysts say the physicians and patients are possibly conflating sub-standard drugs with what they think are fake medicines.
In 2014, India's top drug regulator famously told a newspaper: "If I follow US standards I will have to shut almost all drug facilities."
More than 70 people, mostly children, have died in five separate mass poisoning incidents related to drugs spiked with DEG since 1972.
These drugs failed tests for not having enough of ingredient chemicals, impaired ability to dissolve in the patients' blood or were found to be contaminated.
Each failed sample typically represents a batch of the medicine, which in turn could run into hundreds of thousands of tablets, capsules and injections.
Using right to information law, Mr Thakur found many of India's state-owned drug testing labs lacked key equipment.
Drug sampling practices, he noted, date back to a colonial 1875 law where inspectors pick up a small number of random samples from the market.
India has been debating a law to recall drugs that have been found to be inferior from the market since nearly half a century.
It is difficult to understand the scale of the problem - many of India's drug factories are indeed world-class.
But he suspects that there could be counterfeit or inferior drugs being sold in small towns and villages.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates medical products in the US, posts inspection status of firms supplying drugs to the US and warning letters.
A pharmaceutical industry leader, insisting on anonymity, told me that "although some countries do have very rigid quality standards", India's drugs were completely safe.
"Instead of just sitting down in your house, where you can just dwell on things, you can use this as a distraction, meet knew people," he said.
"It blows my mind - just to see the difference in some of the patients that we've worked with," she said.
"They build their confidence up, it reduces GP appointments, it reduces A&E appointments, and it just makes them connect with the community and be resilient."
The North East has among the highest rates of drug-related deaths, heart disease, liver disease and suicide in England.
Rates of child poverty are double the England average in some areas with poverty underpinning much of the ill health.
Social prescribing is only one part of a plan by the NHS, local councils, and community groups to make improvements by 2030.
"Nine of all 13 areas within this plan have a healthy life expectancy of less than 60 years," she said.
They want medicine "to help them feel better" but the required medicine is often "not chemical, it's social" when the issue is depression and loneliness.
What is needed is "forming friendships and feeling as if they've valued, as if they're worth something", she said.
Health experts in Charlotte County, in southwest Florida, say the victim was probably infected after rinsing their nasal sinuses with tap water.
He added that officials are "working with the local public utilities to identify any potential links and make any necessary corrective actions".
Symptoms include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, disorientation, a stiff neck, a loss of balance, seizures and/or hallucinations.
Tap water can also be used if it is boiled for at least one minute and cooled before use.
People are also advised to avoid taking on water in their nose while in swimming pools or bathing or showering.
An international rugby player has warned a lack of period facilities is adding "obstacles" to women from participating in sport.
One expert said the lack of facilities is the result of grassroots and women's sport being seen as lower priority.
Elinor Snowsill, who has 71 caps for Wales, says she was regularly caught out on her period in the early stages of her career.
"There's still times where we'll travel abroad and there won't be any facilities in the toilet," she said.
Fellow player Llio Emyr said the team has travelled to multiple matches to find there are no facilities in the changing rooms.
"Because of the worry of leaking, or not being able to manage being on their period, or not having access to sanitary bins.
It often comes down to funding, she says, especially for grassroots clubs which are more reliant on creating their own funding.
In 2022, 8% of school girls in Wales surveyed by Sport Wales said they would do more sport if they could manage their period better.
"The first time I volunteered for an hour in the charity shop I was absolutely shattered - I had to take a nap afterwards."
Chronic fatigue syndrome limits what Maddie can do, and overdoing it can leave her feeling unwell, with joint and muscle pain or migraines.
"I used to love going hiking but I can't do that any more without sacrificing a couple of days afterwards to rest.
"Quite honestly I don't think about what I want to do in the future because I don't know what my health will be like.
I don't want to have a huge plan and then not have it become an eventuality - that would just be too hard on me."
"Knowing that what I can do - which is a little - is still helping other people who are in less fortunate situations than me.
"I can't think of a single one of my friends my age who doesn't suffer with anxiety or social anxiety of some sort.
"Knowing that I work with the same group of people every day and they're all absolutely wonderful has really helped that.
"Now we know where the public are already targeting their time, we can look to build on those elements.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended eight online therapies for anxiety and depression.
Each therapy must come with a formal assessment from an NHS therapist in order for it to be recommended.
According to NHS Digital, there is a six-week waiting list for patients who need mental health support in England.
Sarah, who was diagnosed with PTSD by a GP, trialled online therapy as part of a Cardiff University study.
In work, if I've got an important meeting and I feel a bit anxious, it's taught me techniques for breathing and mindfulness."
Mark Chapman, interim director of medical technology and digital evaluation at NICE, said: "Our rapid assessment of these eight technologies has shown they have promise.
But online support isn't right or accessible for everyone, so it's important that we all have a range of support offered to us.
"I noticed one of my nipples was inverted and when I Googled for answers, I thought: 'Oh God, this can't be me.'"
Three years later, after surgery to remove one breast, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and another major reconstructive operation, Kreena felt she was out of the woods.
But then on a trip to Canada "to celebrate the end of my life with cancer", she felt grim.
"He told me to squeeze his hand if I remembered having a red liquid during chemotherapy treatment," Kreena recalls.
The problem is caused by chemotherapy drugs damaging the heart muscle, meaning it can no longer pump properly - and this can lead to heart failure.
But working out which patients will get heart damage, and which won't, has proved really tricky up until now.
During two weeks in a Canadian hospital, she sent voice messages back to relatives, preparing them for the worst.
It was enough to allow Kreena to fly back to the UK, but that was just the start of her journey to recovery.
Medication and intense rehab followed, which allowed her heart to creep back into a normal range of function.
But there was one thing she was told was too dangerous - having a baby would put too much strain on her heart.
A surrogate was found, and using her own embryos, her daughter was born and is now 16 months old.
"Next month, I'm climbing in the Himalayas. I'm living an extraordinary life and I'm very grateful," Kreena says.
Garlic, ginger and ginkgo pills, for example, can delay the healing of skin wounds when breast cancer spreads.
Prof Cardoso said it was not surprising that patients and their carers went searching for complementary or alternative treatments that might make a difference.
On its website, Cancer Research UK says some complementary therapies might stop conventional treatments working as well as they should.
More than one in 10 cancer patients die from heart and blood vessel problems, rather than their initial illness, a study says.
The researchers say the increase in the numbers surviving cancer means more attention should be focused on cardiovascular risk.
Among the 3.23 million cancer patients studied, 38% died from cancer and 11% from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) - of which, three-quarters were from heart disease.
The proportion of cancer survivors dying from CVD was highest in those with disease of the bladder, larynx, prostate, womb, bowel and breast.
The risk in the first year could be explained by the effects of chemotherapy or radiation treatment on people's bodies.
"But it doesn't tell us why some cancer patients may be at higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.
"For some, it might be treatment-related - radiotherapy to the chest and some chemotherapy drugs can lead to a higher risk of heart disease.
A mother of three, Ms Harshina underwent Caesarean operations (also known as C-section) for each of their births.
Her last surgery was a C-section at the Government Medical College Hospital in Kozhikode district in 2017 for the birth of her son.
"When I complained, I was told by the doctors that it was because I had a third Caesarean operation," she says.
The process of trying to trace the source of the pain also took a mental and financial toll on her.
Ms Harshina complained to the state health minister Veena George, which led to the appointment of a committee to investigate the matter.
Earlier this week, Ms Harshina went on a hunger strike outside the hospital, demanding that the state government take action against those responsible.
On Thursday, local Opposition leaders persuaded her to give up the hunger strike, saying it was impacting her health.
The people running the Gloucestershire Mentoring Programme, which is free for 11-25 year-olds, aim to help 300 people over two years.
For anyone affected by the issues raised in this story, information about a range of support is available via the BBC Action Line.
"My mum wasn't driving at the time, so she couldn't come down and see me and my dad's never really attempted to see me much."
"I remember I burst out in tears, thinking that I was going into care, because I thought my mum didn't want me, either.
Now 15, she has attended seven different schools - moving through so many because of her behaviour and threats to expel her.
The programme works with seven different organisations across Gloucestershire and South Gloucestershire and is free to girls and young women in the area.
It has already had 162 people referred, who are either currently being assessed or now in a mentoring relationship.
Her mentor helps her to "get in the right head space", she said, and also helps with things like homework.
This can range from physical, sexual or emotional abuse to neglect, substance misuse or having a relative in prison, amongst others.
They may also be experiencing "adverse community environments", such as poverty or violence, displaying antisocial behaviour, or be linked to others involved in criminal activity.
She said while she has also suffered through her life, "all that's happened, it's made me the person who I am".
"It's those little changes in behaviour and that actually, maybe I am getting through to this young person."
While she was nervous when she first starting mentoring, Rachael said it is all about finding a connection that will help them open up.
"It could take weeks and months for them to actually open up about what they're really there for," she said.
Gloucestershire Mentoring program manager for The Door, Elisha Kyne, said young woman and girls are often "overlooked".
"In terms of that consistent support, and providing that trusted adult over the long period of time it doesn't exist," she said.
"It shows that young person they want to be there for them, they like them, they're not being paid to do it."
Mr McCullar didn't just need medical attention, according to the podcast, he needed to exercise - his brain.
And, roughly three-quarters of adults (76%) said they have experienced negative health effects due to stress, including headaches, fatigue and depression.
In 2018, he launched Inception, the first mental health gym in the state and one of the first in the country.
"You go to a typical gym because you want to move your body and better your body," Mr McCullar explained.
"Same here. You don't have to come in with a diagnosis. You come in because you want to better your psyche."
Jake Luhrs, founder of YourLife gym in Pennsylvania, recommends journaling to clients seeking to build self-esteem and mental resilience - when they're not lifting weights.
The gym owners hope approaching mental health through a traditional fitness lens will help reduce the stigma that stops millions of adults from seeking help.
Those with "actual emotional distress or illness", Dr Sederer said, will have a hard time committing to any routine activities online.
The average delay between the onset of mental illness symptoms and treatment is 11 years, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
Ms Meyer believes making mental healthcare "fun and accessible and integrated" into daily life is key for optimising mental health.
"Every time something good happens to you, or every time you receive positive feedback, drop that in your self-esteem file," she said.
Like with any fitness routine, "when you do a lot of (emotional) push-ups", Ms Meyer said, "over time you start to build strength."
People travelling from China and four other Asian countries now have to produce a Covid-19 negative test report before entering India.
But reports of the surge in China and the memories of two deadly Covid waves in 2020 and 2021 in India have made many people fearful.
You don't have to be a runner or play sport to feel the benefits of exercise - fitting a brisk walk into your day is good enough, UK analysis suggests.
The NHS recommends everyone does 150-300 minutes of physical activity that raises the heart rate every week or 75-150 minutes of vigorous activity per week, which makes you breathe hard.
The benefits of exercise were even greater for some specific cancers, such as head and neck, gastric, leukaemia and blood cancers, but lower for lung, liver, endometrial, colon and breast cancers.
"If you are someone who finds the idea of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week a bit daunting, then our findings should be good news," says Dr Brage.
The analysis, in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, looked at previous published research on the benefits of exercise in nearly 100 large studies and nearly 200 peer-reviewed articles to get an overview of the evidence.
They calculated that if everyone in the studies had done at least 150 minutes of exercise a week - the full amount - then around one in six early deaths would be prevented.
For example, they advise trying to walk or cycle to work or to the shops instead of using a car, or being active when playing with your children or grandchildren.
Tests found that three samples of the cough syrup, made by an Indian drug company called Digital Vision, contained diethylene glycol or DEG, an industrial solvent used in the making of paints, ink, brake fluids.
Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) put out a global warning over four India-made cough syrups thought to be linked to the deaths of 66 children in The Gambia.
Lab analysis of the samples of a syrup made by a 32-year-old firm called Maiden Pharmaceuticals Limited confirmed the presence of "unacceptable amounts" of diethylene glycol and another toxic alcohol called ethylene glycol.
Yet such breathless growth - the industry has been running at a clip of over 9% every year for nearly a decade - has been clouded by allegations of problems of quality and weak regulation.
Mr Thakur says he worries that many Indian firms are not following "good manufacturing practices" or GMP, a drug industry term to refer to testing for quality control.
After the deaths of the children in The Gambia, India claimed that its federal regulator was "robust" and sought more details from the WHO on the causality of the deaths with the exported cough syrup.
A spokesperson told me that its policies ensure that "companies - regardless of where the are located - meet the FDA's strict standards for producing medicines for US patients that are high quality, safe and effective".
"Social prescribing" is part of a plan by health and council bosses to tackle what Gateshead's director of public health described as "really shocking" health outcomes in the region.
It has seen Craig enjoy a day out at an allotment run by his GP's surgery where he has dug and cleared, but also chatted with other people, and not been alone.
Julie Bray, from Oxford Terrace and Rawling Road Medical Group in Gateshead, was one of the first NHS social prescribers in the country and said she was "really passionate" about it.
Linda Robinson, who runs events to help people like Craig from the same Gateshead surgery, said people went to their doctors "because they feel ill, they feel as if they don't fit in".
On 23 February, the Florida Department of Heath said that a patient had been infected "possibly as a result of sinus rinse practices" utilising tap water.
It can lead to a severe infection if it enters through the nose, but it is normally safe through the mouth because stomach acid kills the single-cell microorganism.
"I once had to change my tampon in a kit container on the side of the pitch, where they kept the pads and the balls," she said.
Ms Snowsill said the situation has improved, with the WRU providing support such as period pants, pelvic floor training and cycle tracking for its elite players.
Dr Natalie Brown, who researches the menstrual cycle in sport at Swansea University, said: "The reality is it stops girls and women participating in that sport.
"But also, sometimes it's based on the fact that female sport isn't seen as high profile or as much of a priority compared to the male counterpart to that sport.
The WRU said it was keen to break down any barriers to female participation in rugby, and would be asking all clubs in Wales about facilities needed for the future.
"We are proud of the impact this funding has had and of the work we have done in partnership with local authorities and health boards to disseminate products through our schools, colleges and communities."
"Because I couldn't go to school and all my friends were still in school, I felt isolated," said Maddie, from Cardiff, who volunteers at Tenovus Cancer Care in the city.
Her experience chimes with the findings of a new survey by Public Health Wales, which showed nearly three-quarters of people actively choose to help others to protect and improve their own mental wellbeing.
"I know it won't be for everyone, but compared to where I was a couple of years ago, I do feel more confident in my future now."
Nearly three-quarters of people in Wales choose to help others in order to protect and improve their own mental well-being, according to a new survey released by Public Health Wales.
"Perhaps those individuals who are already benefiting from it can share and spread that message in their community, so other individuals can benefit from it as well."
The therapies have been conditionally recommended by NICE - meaning early assessments have taken place to identify promising medical technology but more evidence needs to be gathered.
Others, such as SilverCloud, provide mindfulness tools and resources which are designed to be completed by the patient, but overseen by a mental health practitioner.
"Developed using tried-and-tested CBT methods, each one has demonstrated it has the potential to provide effective treatment to the many thousands of people who live with these conditions."
Using a series of trials, NICE intends to gather further information about how effective the programmes are, as well as whether they "represent good value for the NHS", Mr Chapman added.
But she added: "We have evidence that these digital therapies hold promise. We now need to know how they work in routine practice so we can tailor them to get the most benefit."
The UK government must urgently give mental health services the financial support they need to be able to expand the availability of new treatment options such as these."
When diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 at 33, she had just settled back into working life after getting married and spending a year backpacking round the world.
She had even arranged to have some of her eggs harvested, so that embryos could be created and frozen in case the cancer treatment made her infertile.
Thanks to advances in treatments, more patients than ever are surviving cancer - but one in 10 are developing serious heart conditions, sometimes soon after finishing treatment, others years later.
Scientists knew that the very young and the elderly were at high risk, but they've now found out that faulty genes also play a role in increasing risk in other people.
"Some have a gene to cause heart failure and they get a second hit from the chemo," explains Dr Alex Lyon, a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Brompton Hospital and Imperial College London.
The good news is that drug treatments can reduce the risk of heart damage in these patients and close monitoring can pick up potential problems early, Dr Lyon says.
After a two-month stay in the country on a no-salt diet and being cared for by her husband, her heart function had improved from 6% to 12%.
Her expedition is part of of push to raise awareness of breast cancer in young women from the charity Coppa Feel, a cause that's important to her.
Cancer patients should tell their doctors if they are taking herbal products because some of the ingredients could stop their treatment working, a cancer conference has heard.
She said it was particularly important that patients always checked with their doctors first before trying complementary therapies for cancer that had spread to the skin.
The danger is that many products can interfere with hormone therapy or chemotherapy treatments, and certain ones prolong the blood clotting process - which can lead to wounds taking longer to heal and more scarring.
It also says it is important to avoid some food and drinks such as grapefruit and oranges during cancer treatment, because they can affect how well cancer drugs are broken down in the body.
The charity says: "Talk to your doctor about any complementary therapies you're thinking of using. Tell them before you start having complementary therapy, especially if you're in the middle of a course of cancer treatment."
Speaking at the Advanced Breast Cancer Fifth International Consensus Conference, Prof Cardoso said therapies like yoga, mindfulness, reiki and acupuncture could have a positive impact on patients' quality of life.
Dr Nicholas Zaorsky, a radiation oncologist, from Penn State Cancer Institute, who led the study, said knowing about the risk could help patients live more healthily in the long term.
"Increasing awareness of this risk may spur cancer survivors to implement healthy lifestyle behaviours that not only decrease their risk of cardiovascular disease, but also the risk of cancer recurrence."
"But some of the cancers included in the study share lifestyle risk factors with cardiovascular disease - for example, obesity and smoking, which might also explain the increased risk.
He added: "We need more research to understand why this is, and whether factors other than the known damaging effects of some anti-cancer treatments on the heart and blood vessels are at play.
"What is becoming increasingly clear is that cancer doctors and cardiologists need to work together from an early stage to try and minimise the risk of patients surviving cancer but succumbing to heart and circulatory diseases."
A woman in the southern Indian state of Kerala who suffered through years of excruciating pain because of a botched surgery says she is still waiting for the doctors responsible to be punished.
It was only in September 2022, when she had tests conducted for a urinary bladder infection, that she found out what the problem was - a scan showed there was a piece of metal inside.
The metal turned out to be a pair of forceps - 6.1cm long and 5 cm wide - used by doctors to clamp down on bleeding vessels during surgeries.
The Kozhikode Government Medical College Hospital said that none of its surgical equipment had gone missing and referred to the two surgeries Ms Harshina had undergone before coming to them.
A separate government probe was unable to trace the origins of the forceps - both the hospitals where Ms Harshina underwent surgeries did not have a record of the instrument.
A mentoring programme aimed at empowering vulnerable girls and young women considered at risk of being drawn into crime has reached 162 people since being set up in March.
"They told me I need to change my ways, otherwise it can get me a serious trouble when I'm older, but I didn't think that helped very much.
"With mentoring, they've sat down, and they've said it in a way where they're not telling you 'you need to sort yourself out', they're giving you advice.
At only 11-years-old, she was scared she would end up in a foster home, but instead her nan, who lived 50 miles away, took her in.
"It was kind of like I didn't have any parents because I didn't have a proper phone, so it was hard to keep in touch with my mum and my dad.
"It was very emotional day, but then both my mum and my stepdad said that they're happy for me to live with them, and I've been living with them since."
Launched in March, it offers those at risk of becoming involved in the criminal justice system the chance to form a trusted relationship with a trained volunteer.
"We just kind of talk and listen to each other, and it's really nice, because it gets me away from home, and it gets me off my phone and everything else," Chloe said.
Since joining the programme Chloe has now started a part-time job and is looking at college applications - something she did not think would be possible.
"I thought I need to be that person's little rock, someone they can talk to for an hour a week, or whatever, and be there for somebody else."
Rachael, who was "in and out of foster care" when she was young, is currently mentoring a 14-year-old girl under this programme, as well as an adult under a separate scheme.
She meets her mentee for about an hour, once a week and activities can vary from meeting in a cafe, going on a walk, or even doing a word-search or crafts together.
You never know what those conversation are going to be... but to see them come away thinking 'oh that's been a positive result', to see that, I just love it.
"It's to let these girls know that they don't need to do this or that, or to try and prove themselves, it's just to be you, for you."
The volunteers are supported by staff at the individual charities, and as well as an initial five-week training course, they can also attend extended training programmes that address specific concerns.
The programme is made up of seven mentoring organisations, which all have their own specialisms: 1625 Independent People; Breathe Youth; Thames Valley Partnership; The Door; The Nelson Trust; WAM Youth; and Young Gloucestershire.
Programme organisers said through listening to the girls and young women, it gives them the space to talk and be heard, which in turn helps them build resilience and to grow in confidence.
While the mentoring is not a crisis service, the mentors can find themselves dealing with issues ranging from emotional problems, run-aways, drug use, and suicidal thoughts.
"For young men and boys they may be presenting with more obvious behaviours that would be linking them, on the route to the criminal justice system," she said.
"Whereas for young women and girls that is sometimes less obvious, and also they can be the culprit of something due to being pulled in via another route.
Ms Kyne said it is the long-term support - which can last a year or more - that is one of the things that makes this programme stand out from others in the area.
The programme, which also liaises with police, social care, health, education and youth services, has funding from the grant-making charity, CHK Foundation, to operate for at least two years.
Jill Anderson, coordinator for Gloucestershire Mentoring Program, said that through working alongside other services they "bridge the gap between girls and young women, and the support they need".
"This is an earlier intervention - we are trying to support people who are going to be linked with the criminal justice system, but we're trying to do that earlier on," she said.
"They help these young people to make good choices, because it's quite often we find that these young people don't have a trusted adult in their life, and that can be quite transformational."
When 42-year-old David McCullar thinks back to the early 2000s, a chapter in his life marked by rapid changes, he recalls palm trees, sunny beaches - and panic attacks that made him ill.
But where gastroenterologists, anti-nausea pills and indigestion drugs failed to make a difference, a podcast about "brain training" and its effects on mental health offered him hope.
Just like routinely lifting weights can help muscles adapt to physical stress, some experts say performing these types of activities regularly can help people adapt to mental pressure.
In 2022, one in four US adults said that most days they are so stressed they cannot function, according to the annual Stress in America survey published by the American Psychological Association.
Not long after hearing the podcast, in 2007, Mr McCullar flew to Arizona to see one of the few practitioners at the time with brain-training experience.

People who are infected contract a disease called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.
CDC data suggests infection in winter months is incredibly rare.
Sterile or distilled water are preferred options.
But she added that there's still more to be done.
"It really affects the way you're able to play."
"Most of the facilities were made for men at the start, obviously.
"The knock-on effects from a long-term perspective are actually huge."
"My self-confidence and self-esteem were absolutely shattered.
Volunteering alone isn't a magic bullet.
"When you do them you get a burst of confidence," she said.
She has found a huge sense of self-worth from volunteering.
That's just amazing.
It's a safe space where you can trust the people there.
Hospital doctors were baffled, until one cardiologist made a crucial link.
She did.
"Most patients are told there's a small risk of heart problems."
"My recovery is incredible," she says.
"I didn't think I'd be coming home."
"So we started to look at other options," she says.
"There's work to do educating patients and doctors."
The study said cancer patients were "perpetually at elevated risk".
She underwent another surgery to have the instrument removed.
Both investigations led to a dead end.
The health department's investigation also failed to fix responsibility.
"I will sit on strike [until I gets justice]," she says.
"I also know that they aren't going to just leave."
Her mum tells her she has had "a very messed-up childhood".
"He didn't really want me," Chloe said.
But Chloe's home life is still difficult.
Despite going through various different councillors nothing seemed to help.
"No one should feel lonely and lost," Rachel said.
"I'm not expecting to work miracles.
"You've got gain their trust and and vice versa.
"I was throwing up every day," Mr McCullar said.
In 2001, the company he worked for went bankrupt.
He lost his job.
He left his hometown.
A few years later, Mr McCullar suffered a debilitating back injury.
Depression followed.
Most people don't manage to do the minimum recommended 150 minutes of exercise a week, however.
But doing some exercise is better than doing nothing, the researchers from the University of Cambridge say.
The researchers say replacing some habits is all that is needed.
The NHS recommends adults also do activities that strengthen muscles twice a week.
Yoga, pilates, lifting weights, heavy gardening and carrying heavy shopping bags all count.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has championed India as the "pharmacy of the world".
The country supplies some two-thirds of anti-retroviral drugs globally to fight HIV.
State-run drug testing labs in many states are under-funded, short-staffed and poorly equipped.

A new approach to helping people with depression is becoming more and more popular.
"Social Prescribing" sees GPs sending patients on trips to places like allotments rather than pharmacies.
Healthcare professionals say it works, and reduces pressure on GPs and A&E too.
Craig Denton, from Gateshead, has struggled with depression and loneliness for years.
"It's like a sense of darkness that covers you, and you can't escape," he said.
He is one of more than eight million adults in England now taking antidepressants.
But, in the North East, a new approach to helping people with depression is growing.
A Florida resident has died after becoming infected with a rare brain-eating amoeba, officials say.
Infections are almost always fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
On Thursday, a spokesman for the state health agency confirmed that the patient had died.
Officials across multiple government agencies are "continuing to investigate how this infection occurred," spokesman Jae Williams said.
The amoeba typically lives in warm fresh water such as swimming pools, lakes and ponds.
According to the CDC, around three Americans get infected each year, often with deadly consequences.
Between 1962 and 2021, only four of the 154 people infected in the US survived.
Officials warn that to avoid infections people should not rinse out their nasal passages with untreated tap water.
Fly-half Elinor Snowsill says access to bins, toilets, and toilet paper during her career has been "pot-luck".
The Welsh government said it is committing £24m to developing sport facilities by 2025.
"I was worried one of the male staff members would walk in while I was doing it."
Some women are choosing not to participate in sport because of a lack of period facilities
Period symptoms can already make it difficult for women to take part in sport, she added.
"We don't need even more obstacles, in the fact that there are no facilities.
"This happens once a month - not once in a while, but 12 times a year."
Grassroots players say the issue is so widespread that it's been "normalised".
"No toilet paper, no bins whatsoever to dispose of period products," she said.
"They need to follow what's been done in leisure centres, where there are plenty of facilities."
The situation could have an "enormous" impact on public health, according to an expert.
Just two hours a week volunteering at a charity shop has helped turn Maddie Davies's life around.
A diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome seven years ago affected all areas of the 19-year-old's life.
It is a disorder characterised by extreme tiredness and there is currently no cure.
"I'm currently much better thanks in part to working at the charity shop and therapy."
Maddie has had counselling to help her focus on setting small, achievable goals.
But she explained she felt incredible afterwards for having achieved something.
"For example, 72% are connecting with nature. That's fantastic.
That is an open resource that we have here on our doorstep throughout Wales.
NICE says the therapies have the potential to help more than 40,000 people in the UK.
There are hopes that introducing online digital therapies could ease pressure on the NHS.
Some online treatments for PTSD have already been trialled by the NHS in Scotland and Wales.
"I've been completely match-fit since I've done the programme," she told the BBC.
She added: "It's given me techniques that are so useful in everyday life.
"It's bonkers what's happened over the past five years," says Kreena Dhiman from Crawley in West Sussex.
She was tired, her chest was tight and she was struggling to breathe.
The diagnosis was acute heart failure and she was rushed to intensive care.
It's even given rise to a new medical specialty called cardio-oncology, which focuses on delivering cancer treatments safely.
Even patients like Kreena, who were left fighting for breath, can return to live a normal life.
"I thought I wouldn't see my 40th birthday, but now it's just two weeks away."
"More people are surviving cancer after chemo and more are getting secondary diseases.
Surgeon Prof Maria Joao Cardoso, said there was no evidence that herbal therapies or creams worked.
If in doubt, it was best not to take anything, she said.
This happens in one in five cases of breast cancer - and less in other cancers.
She highlighted the following herbal products as examples of those which slow down clotting:
But she said people should know "they could end up doing more harm than good".
"The highest goal in medicine is important to remember: do no harm," she said.
The European Heart Journal looked at three million US patients, with 28 different cancers, over 40 years.
UK experts say doctors should be more aware and monitor patients accordingly.
But rates continued to be higher than those in the general population.
"This is another reason why it's important for everyone to have a healthy lifestyle."
The BBC's Imran Qureshi talks to her about her ongoing fight for justice.
"I cannot describe the pain that I suffered for five years," Ms Harshina tells the BBC.
She got two of these at a government hospital in Kozhikode's Thamarassery town in 2012 and 2016.
It was only after this procedure that she started getting stomach pain, Ms Harshina says.
"I was also told that many other women also had a similar complaint."
As the pain persisted, Ms Harshina consulted several doctors over the years.
The Kozhikode Government Medical College Hospital also conducted an internal inquiry.
The BBC reached out to Ms George for comment but is yet to receive a response.
Ms Harshina called off her hunger strike but continues to sit in protest outside the hospital.
"I think I've always known that my behaviour isn't good," Chloe said.
"I've had a lot of counsellors inside school, outside school, and I've had a couple of therapists.
Fifteen-year-old Chloe, not her real name, admits she has a hard time trusting people.
When Chloe was about 13, her nan also decided she did not want her living with her anymore.
She lives in a two-bedroom council flat, which she also shares with her two younger siblings.
She struggles to control her emotions and easily gets angry and frustrated.
Frequently getting into trouble, she was "mouthing off" at teachers and hitting out.
That was until she was put in touch with the Gloucestershire Mentoring Programme.
For Chloe, the chance to form a bond with a trusted adult has started to make a difference.
Girls and young women welcomed onto the programme have all suffered "Adverse Childhood Experiences".
The programme uses volunteers from all walks of life, aged over 18, with one volunteer who is 80-years-old.
Rachael, 40, is a mentor for The Door in Stroud, which leads the collaborative programme.
She became involved with the charity in 2018 and started mentoring in June this year.
"Now I can help a young person, by just being there for them," she added.
"These volunteer mentors working with these young girls, change their life outcomes.
He moved over 1,000 miles (1,600km) away, from Detroit, Michigan, to southern Florida.
He was searching for new beginnings but found panic and anxiety.
He then returned home where he witnessed his parents going through a divorce.
"It just felt like everything was happening all at once," Mr McCullar said.
He returned to Michigan inspired and wanting to help others who were struggling like he had.
The gyms encourage people to perform mental health exercises to decrease anxiety and depression.
"People are already familiar with going to a traditional gym," Mr McCullar said.
"We're just normalising mental health by softening it with the word gym."
There once was a melancholy little gray planet.
He observed the moon as he then turned to face the sky.
The moon soon had blooms covering it from top to bottom.
This entire magnificent universe was crafted by God.
He gave it beauty, joy, and greenery.
There were broad, grassy meadows filled with vibrant flowers.
God then made man to take care of his lovely creatures.
But later, God began to have second thoughts.
He questioned whether Man would truly look after his creations.
Man soon lost sight of God's warning.
He began to steal, lie, and do other sinful things.
As a result, Earth became a vast desert.
But God pardoned Man once he recognised his error.
They come to escape the cold winters - especially the frozen ground.
Despite having all the technology and spaceships you could ever need, the inhabitants hadn't taken care of it.
There were no longer any plants or animals in the entire countryside because of how heavily it had been polluted and defiled.
A little boy was once strolling through the world when he came across a cave and a tiny red flower inside.
The boy carefully pulled up the flower, roots, soil, and all, as it was very ill and on the verge of death.
He looked all over the world, but nothing he saw could possibly contain the blossom because it was so tainted everywhere.
The flower began to flourish because it was far from the pollution and because the youngsters went there every day to take care of it.
The flower received such excellent care that it quickly gave birth to more blossoms, which then spread to other flowers.
To feed, a starling sticks its beak in to the ground and then opens it to make a hole.
A starling's eyes swivel to point forward so it can see if there's a tasty insect grub in the hole.
Even if it could, it would find most of the grubs have dug themselves in deeper to avoid the frost.
It's harder to digest these so the starling's gut grows longer in the winter to get the most out of its food.
Perhaps it is warning us that if we don't take care of our planet, there will come a time when plants will only be able to flourish on the moon.
They either separate the seed from its husk with their beak or they pull the seed apart to get to the good bit - the starch that the seed would have used when it was time to grow.
Because of this, the moon occasionally develops a gentle red shine for a few minutes, acting as a warning light, whenever the young boy's flowers bloom.
When you get to Earth, do not sin.Alternately, as a punishment, the earth will become a large desert and lose all of its beauty.
Then he began looking for a location where he could take care of it.
The boy had the impression that the plant might be able to survive there.
So the young child dressed in his astronaut costume and boarded a spacecraft.
They left for the moon after he placed the tiny red flower in the back.
Then God created birds and other animals to inhabit the forests, meadows, and fields.
The smartest and most intellectual of all of his creatures, Man is what He made.
He then forewarned Man, saying, "You must preserve earth's natural beauty and greenery.
Because of this, there is still some vegetation on the planet.
Thousands of starlings come here every winter, some from as far away as Russia.
This Criminal Appeal is filed under Section 374(2) of theCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 by the advocate for theappellant praying to set aside the order of conviction andsentence in S.C.No.232/2008 on the file of the II AdditionalSessions Judge, Gulbarga and acquit the appellant.
The case was committed to the sessions court for trial, which framed charges against the accused and the accused having pleaded not guilty and having claimed to be tried, the prosecution had examined 17 witness and marked 11 documents and 3 material objects.
It is their consistent evidence that Laxmi was constantly complaining about the appellant ill-treating her complaining that she had produced a female child when he wanted a male child and further that she had not fetched enough dowry and therefore she should bring some more money.
The learned Counsel would point out that PWs.1 to 6, who were the witnesses belonging to the village of the appellant, namely Suntan village, had all turned hostile and not supported the case of the prosecution.
Therefore, in the absence of any direct evidence of ill-treatment or instigation by the appellant, it cannot be said that the prosecution has made out any case insofar as offences punishable under Sections 498A and 306 of the IPC are concerned.
The unfortunate circumstance that PWs.1 to 6, who did make statements in the first instance of they having seen the ill-treatment meted out to the deceased, having turned hostile, does not negate the evidence of other witnesses.
Therefore, to hold that the prosecution had established its case beyond all reasonable doubt insofar as the offence punishable under section 498A cannot be presumed merely on the basis of the evidence of PWs.8 to 11.
In that view of the matter, it cannot be concluded with any certainty that there was constant cruelty meted out to Lakshmi and that there was abetment of the commission of suicide by Laxmi.
We are inclined to concur with the argument put forth by the assessee that Infosys BPO Ltd. is not functionally comparable since it has the benefit of market value as well as brand value.
Therefore we clarify that mere dissatisfaction with the findings of facts arrived at by the learned Tribunal is not at all a sufficient reason to invoke Section 260-A of the Act before this Court.
After hearing the accused on the point of sentence, Learned Sessions Judge has passed further judgment awarding death sentence as against accused Nos.1 to 9, for the offence punishable under Section 302 r/w Section 149 of IPC, on four counts.
Seeing the incident, grand father and uncles of the complaint were proceeding towards Police Station to lodge a complaint, but the Accused accosted them and assaulted and also threatened the public with dire consequences, if they intervened in their action.
After the investigation was over, charge sheet came to be laid against the Accused for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 307, 302, 114, 506 and 504 r/w Section 149 of IPC.
After hearing the accused, on the point of sentence, held that the case falls within the scope of `rarest of the rare case' and awarded death sentence to Accused Nos.1 to 9 for the offence under Section 302 of IPC, on four counts.
He has cited a decision reported in (2010) 1 SCC (CRI) 925 (DILIP PREMNARAYAN TIWARI AND ANOTHER Vs. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA) on the point of appreciation of evidence in so for as the discrepancies/omissions in FIR.
He further submits that though, the alleged eye witnesses, have not witnessed the incident, the trial Court erred in accepting their evidence as gospel truth to base conviction for the offences alleged against the accused.
Charge sheet reveals that accused named in FIR namely Accused No.7/Shivappa Chanabasappa Udakeri, Accused No.10/Raju Siddalingappa Konnanavar and Accused No.13/Siddalingappa Appanna Konnanavar were given up while adding Accused No.9/Shankreppa Chanabasappa Udkeri, Accused No.11/Gourawwa Nagappa Udkeri and Accused No.13/Nagappa Chanabasappa Udkeri in the charge sheet.
Again on 29.8.2005, at about 8.00 am, when the complainant was washing bullocks in front of his house, Accused No.10/Mallawwa, who was standing on the staircase of her house, teased him and threw slipper at him.
On hearing the hue and cry of Pw-1, his wife Ratnavva came to the entrance of their house and requested the Accused not to assault her husband-P.W.1, but Accused Nos.1, 2 and 9 assaulted her and killed at the entrance of her house.
She has further deposed that the CPI, Bailhongal, produced three accused persons viz., accused No.7/Chandranaik, accused No.3/Siddalingappa @ Mudakappa and accused No.5/Rajashekhar @ Gangappa before her on 10.9.2005 along with a report as per Ex.P-61.
IN the cross-examination of P.W-47, she has deposed that since the complainant himself gave further statement stating that the other accused mentioned in the FIR did not commit any offence, they were given up.
All the star witnesses were cross-examined by the defence at length by learned counsel for the accused, but nothing worth while was elicited to disbelieve their oral evidence as to the role of the accused in the commission of crime.
It is alleged that Accused No.10 threw chappal at the complainant and instigated the Accused persons to kill the complainant and his family members and also assaulted on the fore head of the deceased Siddalingappa with a stone.
No doubt the name of Accused No.9/Shankreppa does not find a place in the FIR, but during the course of recording statement of the witnesses, he was arrested and according to the evidence of eye witnesses, Accused No.9 assaulted Ratnavva and Nagappa with an axe.
The evidence of the prosecution that accused No.11 to 15 abetted the crime is not sufficient to base conviction in the absence of cogent and satisfactory evidence and they are entitled for an order of an acquittal for all the offences alleged against them. 20.
Keeping in view the above principles laid down by the Apex Court, we are of the considered view that death sentence awarded by the trial court is contrary to the principles laid down by the Apex Court.
The appellant Messrs. Raghubar Mandal Harihar Mandal, hereinafter referred to as the assessee, is a firm of bullion dealers carrying on its business at Laheriasarai in the district of Darbhanga in the State of Bihar.
The Sales Tax Officer rejected those returns as also the books of account filed by the assessee for all the seven quarters and assessed the assessee under el. (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.
By its order dated December 10, 1948, the Board rejected the applications for making a reference to the High Court on the same ground, namely, that no question of law was involved and the assessment orders were concluded by a concurrent finding of fact.
It is also well settled that the dutyof the High Court is to start with the statement of the case as the final statement of the facts and to answer the question of law with reference to that statement.
We must, therefore, make it clear at the very outset that the question relates to those four quarters only for which assessments were made under s. 10(2)(b) of the Act, and the answer given to the question will govern those four quarters only.
In spite of these differences, thetwo provisions are substantially the same and impose on the assessing authority a duty to assess the tax after hearing such evidence as the dealer may produce and such other evidence as the assessing authority may require on specified points.
The point for our consideration is-can the assessing authority, purporting to act under s. 10(2)(b) of the Act, assess the amount of tax due from a dealer more or less arbitrarily or without basing the assessment on any materials whatsoever ?
In some decisions relating to the corresponding provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act, it has been said that the difference between the two is one of degree only, the one being more summary than the other.
These are questions which do not really fall for decision in the present appeal, which is confined to interpreting the true nature and scope of el. (b) of sub- s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.
Firstly, the High Court treated the question referred to it as a pure question of fact; if that were so, then the High Court should have rejected the reference on the ground that it was not competent to answer a question of fact.
In our view, the approach of the High Court to the question referred to it was erroneous and the answer given to the question by it solely on the basis of sub-s.(4) of s. 10 of the Act was vitiated by that wrong approach.
It was not sub-s. (4) of s. 10 of the Act which the High Court had to consider; it had to consider the true scope and effect of cl. (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.
It is clear to us that what the Sales Tax Officer and the Commissioner did was to hold, for certain reasons, that the returns made by the assessee and the books of account filed by it were incorrect and undependable.
We propose to examine briefly some of those decisions, though, as we have stated earlier, the question is really answered by the observations made by this Court in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills' case (1).
This decision is really against the respondent and does not lay down any rule which may be said to be inconsistent with the observations made by this Court in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills' case (2).
In that case, the validity of the assessment under s. 23 (3) of the Indian Income-tax Act was not challenged by the assessee and the appeal was directed solely to the amount of assessment.
Since he was not satisfied that the return was correct and complete he could not proceed under section 23 (1); he, therefore, as appeared upon the face of the assessment, proceeded under section 23 (3).
The company had been allowed devel-              opment rebate under s. 10(2)(vi-b) and that amount was              debited in the profit and loss account of the company for              the accounting year leaving a small balance of profit in the              profit and loss account.
The development rebate reserve created by thecompany, although it does not form part of the assessableprofits, undoubtedly forms part of the commercial profitsand hence constituted accumulated profits of the company..within the meaning of s. 2(6A)(e).
The use of the expression 'whether capitalised ornot', as qualifying the expression 'accumulated profits' incls. (a) to (d), but not in cl. (e), shows that the legisla-ture does not intend to rope in capitalised profits in el.(e).
The High Court has directed some modification in the calculation of the said amount while answering the other questions referred to it at the instance of the asses- see and we need not go into their details.
We think that the term "profits" occurring in section 2(6A)(e) of the 1922 Act means profits in the com- mercial sense-that is to say the profits made by the Company in the real and true sense of the term.
By the amendments made by the Income-tax Amendment Act, 1946., the Finance Act, 1955 and the Finance Act, 1956 certain initial depreciation was allowed in re- spect of buildings newly erected or the machinery and plant newly installed.
The amount of initial depreciation was not deductible in deter- mining the 'written down value' although under proviso (c) it was to be taken into account in the aggregate of all allowances so as not to permit them to exceed the maximum limit provided therein.
Although initial depreciation and development rebate were not identical as they differed in some material particulars, they were similar in nature as both were by way of incentive for installation of new ma- chinery or plant.
The initial depreciation or the develop- ment rebate was to be allowed, as the case may be; at a certain percentage of the actual cost of the machinery or the plant for the year of installation only.
In the Finance Act of 1955 a provision was made to allow a development rebate of 25% of the cost of all new plant and machinery installed for business purposes instead of the then existing initial depreciation allowance of 20%.
Calcutta v. Sri Bibhuti Bhusan Dutt(1) and submitted that it has taken a view different from the one taken by the Gujarat High Court even in regard to the nature of normal 'depreciation allowance.
It is not neces- sary for us to examine in this case the exact nature of the normal depreciation allowance and whether it is deductible from the profits of a person while determining his commer- cial profits.
The words "as are liable to be taxed under the Act" are not there in the definition and it would not, in our opinion, be permissible to so construe the clause as if those words were a part of that clause.
Under clause (e) an advance or loan or money to a shareholder by a pri- vate Company has been directed to be treated as dividend to the extent to which the Company possessed accumulated profits.
For the purpose of distribu- tion of the dividend the amount of development rebate could form part of the profits of the Company; a fortiori, it would be so far the purposes of clause (e) also.
In clauses (a) to (d) of section 2(6A) of the 1922-Act so also in the corresponding clauses of section 2(22) of the 1961-Act the expression "accumulated profits" is qualified by the expression "whether capitalised or not".
Even under the 1961 Act distribution of bonus shares to the equity shareholders after capitalising the profits in accordance with law is not to be a deemed dividend although distribu- tion of such shares to preference shareholders is.
Lord Herscheil in the case of Ann Bouch and Wil- liam Bouch v. William Bouch Sprou(1) was considering as to what was the nature and substance of the transaction in question in that case.
It is admitted on both sides that there was bad 290 blood in the village Dhankoli between a caste known as Baories on one side and three other castes of the village namely, Jats, Dhobis and Khaties on the other.
Their case is that the enmity is due to the fact that the villagers decided not to employ the Baories for watch and ward work in the village as they suspected that the Baories were responsible for certain thefts that had occurred there.
This was resented by the Baories and the allegation is that the Baories were responsible for the fight and attacked some of the others in the village and that led to a fight; but none of the appellants was concerned with it.
One group consisting of 25 persons were charged under section 325/149 of the Indian Penal Code for intentionally beating, along with the other accused, 1. Chhotiya 2. Seruri 3. Parsia 4. Mana 5. Govinda and 6. Ganesh.
These twenty five were acquitted and we are not concerned with them except to note that they were not concerned with that part of the occurrence which we have set out as steps 6 and 7 above.
Five of the eleven are said to 293 have beaten them with "swords and lathis"; another five "with lathis, etc." while the eleventh, Sukha, is said to have fired at Parsia and Mana "as a result of which they fell down".
On this part of the case, the learned Sessions Judge found that " whatever beating was done was done immediately after the scuffle between Chhotiya and Parsia and Sukha and Gumana and Gumana and Naraina, and those accused who had arrived on the spot.
Counsel for the State, however, contended that this passage refers to the second instigation which is said to have been given after the eleven had chased and beaten Lacbhuri and returned to finish off the others who were lying on the ground.
The first was because "Ladia (P.W. 11) did not state in his statement before the police that after beating Lachhuri, when ten or eleven persons had returned then at the instigation of Sukha and Gumana the injured were again beaten to death".
It is claimed that the accused had looked after Lakshmi well till the birth of their first child, which was a girl and he was not happy with the girl child and thereafter started ill-treating Lakshmi, apart from which, he was also demanding dowry and on that pretext, he used to assault her continuously.
It is the complainant's further case that in this regard, she along with her son Ramakrishna and Goudappa Patil went to the house of accused at Suntan village and had advised the accused not to ill-treat Lakshmi by demanding money, as they could ill- afford any such dowry.
Insofar as the offence punishable under section 306 of the IPC, is concerned, again would require the prosecution to establish the circumstance that there was instigation by the appellant on Lakshmi to commit suicide and that he had intentionally driven her and his daughter to commit suicide.
Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is right in law in directing the TPO to apply RPT filter of 15% by superimposing the decisions of the Tribunal in other cases without going into specific facts of the taxpayer and without adducing the basis for arriving at the 15% cut off for RPT filters?
We find that the assessee has brought on record sufficient evidence to establish that this company is functionally dis- similar and different from the assessee and hence is not comparable and the finding rendered in the case of Trilogy E-Business Software India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) for Assessment Year 2007-08 is applicable to this year also.
On the other hand, the appeals of the present tenor as to whether the comparables have been rightly picked up or not, Filters for arriving at the correct list of comparables have been rightly applied or not, do not in our considered opinion, give rise to any substantial question of law.
The trial Court, after hearing arguments, perusing oral and documentary evidence on record, came to a conclusion that the prosecution brought home the guilt to the Accused for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 302, 307, 114, 506, 504 read with section 149 of IPC.
The bone of contention of the defence is that as all the independent eye witnesses have not supported the case of prosecution, the trial Court erred in convicting the accused for the alleged offences solely on the basis of interested testimony of the witnesses who are related to deceased and the complainant.
P.W-1 has deposed that his father-Siddappa died about 14 years back prior to the incident and his senior uncle-Basappa and his father though living in the same house of Siddalingappa, they had separate mess; whereas other 6 sons including the deceased Mallappa and Nagappa were living together with Siddalingappa and they had a common mess.
Since then, Accused No.10/Mallawwa used to abuse the family members of the complainant, in vulgar language, whenever they went in front of her house; when P.W3/Kasturi was proceeding towards the land; Accused Nos.1 and 3 teased and abused her in vulgar language and also restrained her from proceeding further. She informed the incident to the family members.
Again, on 30.8.2005, at about 7.00 a m, when the complainant was going to attend nature's call, Accused Nos.1 to 9 were armed with long and axes etc., came along with other accused namely Accused Nos.10,11,12,13,14 and 15 and challenged the complainant and his family members and attempted to kill the complainant and his family members.
Though there is no mention in the complaint about the overt acts by Accused No.8, the evidence of the eye witnesses is sufficient to hold that all nine accused ( namely Nos.1 to 9), in pursuance of the common object and at the instigation of Accused No.10/Mallawwa, they have killed Ratnavva, Siddalingappa, Nagappa and Mallappa, within half an hour.
In the decision reported in (2011)10 SCC 389, supra, Apex Court has held that the appellant/Accused would not be a menace to society and no reason to believe that the appellant cannot be reformed or rehabilitated or would constitute a continued threat to society and it is not the `rarest of the rare case' causing for extreme penalty of death.
In the decision reported in (2011)13 SCC 706, supra, the Apex Court has held that murder committed in a very brutal and inhuman fashion alone cannot justify death sentence and in the absence of any evidence to show that the appellant was a continuing threat to society or was beyond reform and rehabilitation, death sentence cannot be sustained.
The Sales Tax Officerconsidered that the account books were not dependable and,after rejecting them as well as the returns, proceeded toestimate the gross turnover by adopting a figure by pureguess, without reference to any evidence or material, andmade the assessment under s. 10 (2) (b) of the Act.
The Board expressedthe view that the finding of the Sales Tax Officer and the Commissioner that the books of account maintained by the assessee were not dependable was a finding of fact which could not be interfered with in revision ; -therefore the assessing officer was bound to assess to' the best of his judgment.
The provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act are in pari materia with the provisions of the Act under our consideration, the main scheme of the relevant provisions of the two Acts being similar in nature, though the wording of the provisions is not exactly the same.
In the case under our consideration, the question which was referred to the High Court related to the assessments made under s. 10(2)(b) of the Act; in other words, the question related to those four quarters only for which the assessments were made under s. 10(2)(b).
At one place in its judgment, the High Court referred to a slight inaccuracy in the question framed, but it did not reframe the question so as to widen its scope and include the three quarters for which assessments were made under s. 10(4) of the Act.
That expression is perhaps a little ambiguous, but read in the context of the statement of the case, the question can only mean this: can the assessing authority adopt a figure of gross turnover by pure guess and without referring to any materials on which the figure is based ?
The High Court applied the same analogy and on that footing held that there being no difference between an assessment under cl.(b) of sub-s. (2) and an assessment under sub-s. (4) of s.10 of the Act, the answer to the question must be in the affirmative.
The assessing authorities further pointed out that there was a discrepancy between the return filed for the quarter ending June 30, 1946, and the accounts filed in support of it; the return showed a gross turnover of Rs.2,28,370-12-0 while the accounts revealed a gross turnover of Rs. 1,48,204.
These and similar orders do not show that the assessment was made with reference to any evidence or material; on the contrary, they show that having rejected the books of account, the assessing authorities indulged in -pure guess and made an assessment without reference-to any evidence or any material at all.
Secondly, learned counsel for the respondent has referred us to several decisions on which the High Court relied and has argued that on the basis of those decisions, it must be held that the answer given by the High Court to the question referred to it was a correct answer.
Lord Russell of Killowen in delivering the judgment of their Lordships made the following observations as respects a "best of judgment " assessment within the meaning of s. 23 (4) of the Indian Income-tax Act: " The officer is to make an assessment to the best of his judgment against a person who is in default as regards supplying information.
In answering that question in the affirmative, the High Court has given a carte blanche to the Sales Tax authorities and has, in our opinion, misdirected itself as to the true scope and effect of cl. (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.
Their Lordships observed: 'But it appears to them that it was clearly competent for the Income-tax Officer in the circumstances of the present case to accept the return as a valid return and proceed to assessment under section 23 (1) or section 23 (3) as the case might be.
Treating the withdrawals by              the appellant as advances by the company to him and finding              the highest amount of advance to the assessee to be within              the total figure of accumulated profits as arrived at by              him, he directed the addition of the advance to the asses-              see's income as dividend under s. 2(6A)(e) of the Act.
The Appellate Assistant Commissioner modi- fied the figure of the deemed dividend calculated by the Income-tax Officer and took the highest amount of advance made (I) 76 I.T.R. 369.641 to the assessee by the Company at a particular point of time in the year in question as the amount of dividend taxable in the hands of the assessee.
It may just be stated here that according to the 1922 Act only the accumulated profits possessed by the company at the. end of the corresponding previous year had to be taken into account unlike the corresponding provision engrafted in section 2(22) of the Income-tax Act, 1961--hereinafter referred to as the 1961 Act, read with Explanation II thereto.
Counsel submitted that it is in the nature of a depreciation allowance and is identical with initial depre- ciation; it should, therefore, be deducted from the commer- cial profits of the Company as held by the Gujarat High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay North v. Viramgam Mills Co. Ltd. (4).
The Taxation Enquiry Commission in its report aforesaid had recommended in Chapter VII, page 98 of Vol. II for assisting the expansion and development of :productive enterprise by allowing them a proportion of new investment in fixed assets to be charged to current costs of production thereby permitting the taxable profits to be brought down to that extent.
We do not find any warrant for accepting the contention of Mr. Rajgopal that the initial depreciation or the develop- ment rebate was allowed as 'an extra deductible allowance of business expenses in the year of installation of new machin- ery for meeting the ever increasing costs of its replacement in future years.
It held that it could not form part of the accumulated past profits as in the words of Wixon (vide Wixon's Accounts Hand Book) it was "the estimat- ed 645 expiration of asset value" or as observed by Paton in his Accountants' Hand Book, Third edition it is an out-of-pocket cost as any other cost.
The purpose of section 2 (6A) of the 1922 Act corresponding to section 2(22) of the 1961 Act is to include within the term "dividend" for the purpose of taxation certain distri- butions or payments of certain items of money or the like as deemed dividend for the purpose of taxation.
The "capitalisation of profits". says the learned author, means "that profits which otherwise are available for distribution among the shareholders are not divided among them in cash, but that the shareholders are allotted further shares--or debentures--which are paid up wholly or in part out of' those profits.
For the reasons stated above, we hold that the develop- ment rebate reserve created by the Company by duly charging the amount of profit and loss account although liable as a deduction under the 1922Act, constituted accumulated profits of the Company Within the meaning of section 2(6A)(e).
The State did not appeal against the acquittals of the twenty five under section 325/149 nor did it appeal against the acquittals of two of the eleven who were charged under section 302/149 but it appealed against the acquittals of the remaining nine who had been convicted under section 325/149.
But the reason why we have set out these charges at some length is because counsel for the appellants argued that the prosecution case is that there were two separate assemblies, one of twenty five persons to beat six specific persons and another of eleven to kill them in three groups.
He argued that the twenty five who constituted the first assembly have all been acquitted; that the only material from which an unlawful assembly can be inferred in the other case is the instigation of Sukha and Gumana for a second time after they bad returned from chasing Lachhuri.
He also rejected the prosecution version that the incidents occurred in two parts, first with a bigger assembly that beat all the accused and next with a smaller one that ran after Lachhuri and beat her and then returned to beat the others to death at the instigation of Sukha and Gumana.
She had performed the marriage of her elder daughter Laxmi six years prior to the complaint.
In this regard, it is the complainant's case that Laxmi had repeatedly told her about the ill-treatment.
The complainant however had consoled her daughter and had assured her that she would advise the accused to take better care of her.
Based on which, a case was registered on 8.3.2008 and a report was submitted to the Court of the JMFC.
Whether the prosecution proves that accused has given ill-treatment to deceased Laxmi by demanding her to bring money from her parental house?
The only evidence on which the prosecution and the court below however placed reliance is on the evidence PWs.8 to 11.
It is their own case that Laxmi had on and off informed them of such ill-treatment.
He was not in any way related to the complainant or her family and he had no ill-will against the accused.
It is only to bring the case within the scope of Section 498A that such an allegation is made.
The court concluded that by no stretch of imagination, the ingredients of abetment are attracted on the statement of the deceased.
Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must be capable of being spelt out.
The court has opined that there should be intention to provoke, incite or encourage the doing of an act by the latter.
Therefore, it is impossible to lay down any straitjacket formula in dealing with such cases.
Each case has to be decided on the basis of its own facts and circumstances.
Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing.
Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.
In that view of the matter, the finding of the court below based entirely on the evidence of PW.8 to 11 cannot be sustained.
Learned counsel for the Appellants-Revenue Mr.E.I.Sanmathi submits that he does not press the substantial question of law No.1.
We consider it appropriate to quote the relevant portion of the order of Tribunal, which runs as hereunder:- "12.
We further note that the functional comparability has been examined in detailed by Vs. M/s.
For the reasons given above, we are of the view that if the functions actually performed Vs. M/s.
M/s. Tesco Hindustan Centre Pvt. Ltd 8/11 enjoys the benefits of scale and market leadership.
In this view of the matter, we hold that this company ought to be omitted from the set of comparable companies.
A substantial quantum of international trade and transactions depends upon the fair and quick judicial dispensation in such cases.
The appeal filed by the Appellants-Revenue is liable to be dismissed and it is dismissed accordingly.
It is registered under Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in Criminal R C No.11/2009.
As required under sub-section (1) of Section 366 of Cr.PC, learned trial Judge has submitted the records for confirmation of Death sentence.
The complainant-Suresh Siddappa Wodeyar (PW-1) and his family members are permanent residents of Murkibhavi village in Bailhongal Taluk.
The complainant's father has 7 brothers and all of them were residing together in the same place.
It is also alleged that accused No.1/Sundresh and accused No.3/Sidlingappa were often teasing P.W.3 and blocking her way whenever she went to lands.
He informed about the incident to his family members, for which they told him that a complaint would be lodged on the next day.
But on the other hand Accused No.2 assaulted Ratnawwa with kyota on left side of her chest and left arm.
The prosecution went to trial by examining as many as 48 witnesses and got marked 66 documents and 38 Material Objects.
He further submitted that the case on hand cannot be treated as a `rarest of rare cases' to award death sentence.
It is also contended that in the FIR, there was no allegation against accused No.8/Irappa.
Accused No.7/Chandranaik and his wife-accused No.10/Mallawwa were residing in the house nearby to the complainant.
Accused No.10/Mallawwa is the sister of Accused No.5/Rajshekhar, Accused No.9/Shankreppa, Accused No.12/Basavanneppa and Accused No.13/Nagappa.
It is pertinent to mention that the weapon 'long' is called as 'kyota' in Kannada.
The alleged abettors namely Accused Nos.10 to 15 are aged about 44, 45, 56, 52, 57 and 48 years, respectively.
Merely because those witnesses have not deposed in support of the prosecution, case of the prosecution cannot be rejected in toto.
Therefore,the evidence of P.Ws.1, 2,3,4,5 and 32, who are the eye witnesses cum related to the complainant require to be scrutinized carefully.
In our view, there is no strong ground to reject their evidence in toto for the following reasons.
He has deposed in evidence that the deceased Siddalingappa had 8 sons and 2 daughters.
She informed about the incident to her family members including deceased persons; they enquired with the Accused.
P.W1 has deposed that he was hearing and also watching the scene from inside the house.
She seized the said Scooter under a panchanama in the presence of P.Ws.16 and 17 as per Ex.P12.
She has sent 47 sealed articles to FSL, Belgaum for chemical examination and filed charge sheet on 8.3.2006.
Nothing worthwhile is elicited in her cross-examination with regard to the evidence given before the trial Court.
Ex.P.51-rough sketch of scene of crime, shows the place of crime and the place where the dead bodies were lying.
There is no major omissions and contradictions elicited in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses.
The dead bodies lying on the street can be seen in the photographs at Exs.P26 to 29, taken at the scene of crime.
The contention of the learned counsel for the accused that Accused No.9 was falsely implicated in the case falls to the ground.
The prosecution has proved that all the above said four persons died an homicidal death.
The trial Court has classified the case of murder as 'rarest of rare cases' and awarded death sentence to Accused Nos.1 to 9.
The facts to be considered for awarding death sentence are the magnitude and the manner and brutality.
In the above-said case i.e., Brijendrasingh's case, the Apex Court has given the cases falling under the category of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
II. Appeal in Crl. A. No. 2516 of 2009 filed by accused No.1, 4 to 6, 8, 9 and Crl.
Accused are entitled for set-off of the period of detention undergone by them under section 428 of Cr.P C. X.
The Sales Tax Officer passed separate orders assessing the tax for all the seven quarters simultaneously on October 9, 1947.
The Board of Revenue was then moved in revision but, by its order dated July 31, 1948, the Board refused to interfere.
The assessee then moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal from the said judgment and order of the High Court.
Having thus indicated the precise scope of the question referred to the High Court, we proceed now to consider the main contention of the assessee.
We must first read the relevant provisions of the statuteunder which the assessments were made.
These provisions are similar to the provisions contained in s. 23 of the Indian Income-tax Act.
It is clear to us that, understood in that sense, the High Court has answered the question incorrectly.
The decision is that of Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. v.Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal(1).
In our view, the aforesaid observations clearly show that the High Court was in error in answering the question in the affirmative.
We have examined the assessment orders in question, which form part of the statement of the case.
Having rejected the returns and the books of account, the assessing authorities proceeded to estimate the gross turnover.
In so estimating the gross turnover, they did not refer to any materials at all.
On the contrary, they indulged in a pure guess and adopted a figure without reference to any evidence or any material at all.
Sales Tax Officer said: "I reject the dealer's accounts and estimate a gross turnover of Rs. 4,00,000.
This the assessing authorities were not entitled to do under cl. (b) of sub.s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.
The first decision is the Privy Council decision in Income- tax Commissioner v. Badridas Ramrai Shop, Akola (2).
He must not act dishonestly, or vindictively or capriciously, because he must exercise judgment in the matter.
In the case under our consideration, the assessing officer did not do so, and that is where the grievance of the assessee arises.
There again, the estimate made was not a pure guess and was based on some materials which the Income-tax Officer had before him.
The last decision to which we have been referred is the decision in Malik Damsaz Khan v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1).
For these reasons we hold that the High Court, was in error in answering the question referred to it.
The appeal is accordingly allowed and the judgment and order of the High Court are set aside.
The appellant will be entitled to its costs both in this Court and in the High Court.
The appellant-assessee was a shareholder in a company              in which the public were not substantially interested within              the meaning of s. 23A.
The              Tribunal held that the development rebate was not liable to              be treated as accumulated profits; but, on reference.
Thenormal depreciation and the additional depreciation arepermitted to be deducted from the written down value.
Section 2(6A)(c)provides that 'dividend' includes any distribution to theshareholders liquidation to the extent to which the distri-bution is attributable to accumulated profits.
Merely transferringthe sum to the development reserve account by debiting it tothe profit and loss account did not amount to capitalisationof profits.
The decision of the Tribunal was partly in favour of the assessee and partly in favour of the Revenue.
Four questions were referred-one at the instance of the Commissioner of Income-tax and three at the instance of the assessee.
He could not and did not attack the decision of the High Court as respects questions 2, 3 and 4.
We proceed to state the necessary facts for determina- tion of the above question only.
The assessee in his accounting year 1957-58 had withdrawn con- siderable amounts of money from the Company's account.
It was found that the aggregate amount of develop- ment rebate allowed to the Company under section 10(2)(vi-b) was Rs. 2,36,470/-.
We shall do well to quote all the subclauses (a) to (e) of section 2(6A) of the 1922-Act.
In the context --sometimes it means the assessable profits and sometimes it means the commercial profits.
The fundamen- tal meaning is the amount of gain made by the business during the year.
This can only be ascer- tained by a comparison of the assets of the busi- ness at the two dates ......
There is no definable relation between the assessable income and the profits of a business concerned in a commercial sense.
We may add that Mr. Rajgopal could not and did not seriously dispute this proposition of law.
By and large, the cost of replacements is allowed as deductions in lieu of depreciation in respect of certain assets.
Obviously, it was by way of an incentive for the new structures or the new installations.
Development rebate was provided in clause (vi-b) with effect from 1st April, 1955 by the Fi- nance Act of 1955.
There was an over-lapping period of about two years in relation to the allowance of initial depreciation or the development rebate.
But as provided for in clause (vi) an assessee could not have' had both even in regard to that period.
It was not a recurring allowance for the subsequent years like; the allowance of the normal depreciation or the additional depreciation.
Although it does not form part of the assessable profits, undoubtedly it does form part of the commercial profits.
The advance or the loan, by a legal fiction, is to resemble the actual dividend.
What is the purpose of this difference in the phraseology of the various clauses of sub-section (6A) ?
The reason is -not far to seek and yet not helpful to the assessee in this case.
The profits of a Company can be capitalised in accord- ance with the Articles of Association and the law.
On the capitalisation of the profits they cease to be profits in the hands of the Company.
The nature of the asset is changed although it does not make any difference in the total assets of the Company.
The most common example of capitalisation of profits is by issuance of bonus shares to the shareholders.
Clause (a) to (d) were intended by the Legislature to cover the cases of accumulated profits even though they may be capitalised.
But the Legislature did not intend to rope in the capitalised profits in clause (e).
To the extent the profits have been capitalised the Company cannot be said to possess any accu- mulated profits.
To the same effect is the statement of the law to be found in Palmer's Company Law, twenty-first edition page 673.
We accordingly affirm the decision of the High Court and dis- miss this appeal but in the circumstances make no orders as to costs.
This was said to be the result of a riot that occurred in the village Dhankoli.
The remainder were all charged under section 325/149 of the Indian Penal Code and eleven were also charged under section 302/149.
The learned Sessions Judge acquitted twenty five of the charge under section 325/149 and convicted nine.
He acquitted all the eleven who were charged under section 302/149 but convicted nine of them under section 325/149.
The High Court dismissed the appeal of the convicts and allowed that of the State.
The case for the prosecution is that this was due to a dispute over a field that belonged to some of the Jats.
There were some court proceedings about the field in which Parsia (one of the Baories who was killed) had appeared against the Jats.
The accused Sukha, Gumana, Begla and Govinda were in particular interested in this field and so bore a grudge against Parsia.
From this point it will be convenient to divide the narrative into a series of numbered steps.
They returned to their village about 11 p.m. and ran into the accused Sukha and Gumana (both Jats).
However, on 7.3.2008, she had received a message from Jaganath of Suntan village, that at about 10 p.m., her daughter Laxmi and grand-daughter Bhagewati had died of drowning in a well.
The complainant, Ramakrishna and Goudappa Patil did rush to the Suntan village and saw the dead body of her daughter and grand-daughter and then lodged a complaint against the accused.
An inquest mahazar was conducted of the deceased and the bodies were sent for post-mortem and after taking further steps, a charge sheet was submitted against the accused as on 17.9.2008.
On conclusion of the trial and on examination of the accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the court below had framed the following points for consideration:- 1.
PW.8 is the mother of the deceased Laxmi, PW.9 is the brother, PW.10 is the sister and PW.11 is an elder of the village.
First of all, those witnesses did not have any direct knowledge nor is it their case that they have seen the appellant ill-treating the deceased or instigate her to commit suicide.
As has been laid down in a catena of decisions, the ill-treatment by the husband within the four walls of the house would hardly be witnessed by others.
The fact of ill-treatment is narrated first hand by the deceased time and again to the complainant and others, as consistently stated by them.
In Ramesh Kumar vs. State of Chhattisgarh, (2001)9 SCC 618, a three-judge bench of the apex court had occasion to deal with a case of similar nature.
In an argument between a husband and wife, the husband had stated that "you are free to do whatever you wish and go wherever you like".
The apex court, in that circumstance, examined the different shades of the meaning of "instigation" as hereunder:- "20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do `an act'.
To satisfy the requirement of instigation though it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what constitutes instigation must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of the consequence.
It is also possible that sheer frustration of not having borne a male child, which the appellant is alleged to have desired, may have also driven her to commit suicide.
Even if it was her case that she was being harassed and ill-treated, there was no such allegation of harassment and ill-treatment of the young child.
We, therefore, direct that these two entities be excluded from the list of 10 comparables finally taken by the AO/TPO as per the direction of the DRP?.
Since we have directed the A.O/TPO to exclude these companies from the set of comparables therefore the TPO is directed to compute the ALP on the basis of remaining comparables". 5.
This Crl. R C is filed under Section 366 of the Code ofCriminal Procedure, for confirmation of death sentenceawarded to accused Nos.1 to 9 by the Presiding Officer, FastTrack Court-II & Addl.
By the impugned judgment dated 16.12.2008, learned Sessions Judge convicted all the 15 accused persons for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 307, 302, 506, 504 read with section 149/114 of IPC.
It is alleged that accused No.10/Mallawwa (wife of accused No.7/Chandranaik) used to taunt and challenge the complainant's family members and threatened with dire consequences if they lodged a complaint with Police.
On 30.8.2005 (Tuesday) at about 6.30 AM, when the complainant-P.W1 was going to answer nature's call, Accused No.10/Mallawwa instigated the Accused to kill the complainant-P.W.1.
Thus, the Accused assaulted Siddlingappa, Mallappa and Nagappa (grand father and uncles of the complainant) with koyta, axe, sickle, jambia, stick and stone.
The Police registered a case in Crime No.72/2005 on 30.8.2005 at about 8.15 A.M., for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 302, 109 and 506 r/w section 149 of IPC.
Since the offence under Sections 307 and 302 of IPC are exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions, the case was committed to Sessions Court, where it was registered as SC No.28/2006.
The trial Court, after hearing arguments, framed charges against all the 15 persons for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 302, 307, 114, 506, 504 read with Section 149 of IPC.
He prayed that the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence awarded against the Accused may be set aside and the all the accused may acquitted of the offences alleged them.
At the very outset, it must be mentioned that the alleged independent eye witnesses - P.Ws.6 to 15, 20 to 24 have not supported the case of prosecution.
Accused Nos.1 to 9 are aged about 28 years, 26 years, 24 years, 21 years, 38 years, 30 years, 51 years, 18 years and 53 years, respectively.
All the independent eye witnesses, viz., P.Ws.6 to 15, P.Ws.20 to 24 have not supported the case of prosecution for the reasons best known to them.
According to P.W-1, about 1 year prior to the incident, when P.W3/Kasturi (w/o P.W1's elder brother-Ulavappa Siddappa Wadeyar) had been to fetch water, Accused Nos.1 and 3 poured water and pulled her.
It is the case of the prosecution that on 30.8.2005 at about 6.30 a.m., all the Accused started chasing the complainant; he made hue and cry and went in side his house.
It is in his evidence that after assaulting his wife Ratnavva, grandfather-Siddlingappa, uncles Nagappa and Mallappa, all the accused chased him and PW-5 Maruthi with an intention to kill them.
Further, she has seized axe (M.O-12), blue colour shirt (M.O- 47) and while lungi (M.O-48) at instance of Accused No.1 under a panchanama in the presence of the above-said panchas.
Likewise she has seized one long (M.O-19), shirt (M.O-50) and black and yellow checks lungi (M.O-51) at the instance of Accused NO4, under a panchayama (Ex.P-13).
She has recorded voluntary statement of Accused NO.5 and accused No.7 as per Ex.P65; Ex.P66 respectively and recovered their clothes worn at the time of incident and weapons used in the commission of crime.
She has deposed that on 16.9.2005, the ASI produced accused No.13/Nagappa Udakeri before her and she interrogated and produced him before the court for remand.
Ex.P-47/FSL report reveals that 47 articles were subjected to chemical analysis and all the articles except two articles viz., sample mud and lungi were stained with blood.
The Apex Court has laid down the principles to determine whether this case falls within the scope of rarest of rare cases for imposition of death sentence.
The impugned order of sentence made against Accused Nos.1 to 10 for offences punishable under Section 114,143,147,148, 307 (on two counts), 504,506 read with section 149 is also confirmed.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 8, 1952, of the Patna High Court in Misc. Judicial Cases Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 -of 1949.
The assessee was assessed to sales tax for seven quarters ending December 31, 1945, March, 31, 1946, June 30, 1946, September 30, 1946, December 31, 1946, March 31, 1947 and June 30, 1947, respectively.
The assessee then moved in appeal the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Tirhut Division, but the Commissioner dismissed the appeals by his order dated February 23, 1948.
The Board was then moved under s. 21 of the Act to refer certain questions of law to the High Court of Patna which, the assessee contended, arose out of its order.
The Board of Revenue then stated a case, and the High Court disposed of the reference by answering the question in the affirmative by its judgment and order dated January 8, 1952.
Before we proceed to consider this contention of the assessee, it is necessary to clear the ground by delimiting the precise scope of the question referred to the High Court.
Under sub-s. (5) of s. 21 the High Court hears the reference and decides the question of law referred to it, giving in a judgment the grounds of its decision.
The question did not relate to the three quarters for which the assessee had filed no returns and assessments were made under s. 10(4) of the Act.
The question, as it stood and as it was answered by the High Court, did not relate to the propriety or legality of the assessments made under s. 10(4) of the Act.
In the question referred to the High Court, the expression used is, "make an assessment on any figure of gross turnover without giving any basis to justify the adoption of that figure".
The High Court went into an elaborate consideration, by way of comparison and contrast, of sub-s.(4) and el. (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Act.
With regard to the corresponding provision in sub-s. (3) of s. 23 of the Indian Income-tax Act, there is a decision of thisCourt which, in our opinion, answers the question before us.
It is not necessary to repeat those reasons, because we must accept the finding of fact arrived at by the assessing authorities that the returns and the books of account were not dependable.
The decision of the Lahore High Court in Seth Gurmukh Singh v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Punjab (3) was specifically approved by this Court in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills' case (2).
The decision does not lay down that it is open to the Income-tax Officer to make an estimate on pure guess and without reference to any material or evidence before him.
But the initial depreciation or the development rebate isnot a recurring allowance for the subsequent years like thenormal depreciation allowance provided in s. 10(2)(vi) orthe additional depreciation provided in s. 10(2)(vi-a).
In TeaEstate India Pvt. Ltd. v. C.I.T., W. Bengal (103 ITR 785) itwas held that accumulated profits in cl. (c) include devel-opment Tebate.
If for the purpose of distribution theamount of development rebate could form part of the accumu-lated profits of the company, a fortiori, it would be so farthe purpose of cl. (e) also.
That is, to the extent the profits have been capita-lised in accordance with the law and its Articles of Associ-ation, a company cannot be said to possess any accumulatedprofits.
Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras v.K. Srinivasan andothers 50 ITR 786 approved.       Sheth Haridas Achratlal v. Commissioner of Income tax,Bombay North, Kutch and Saurashtra, Baroda 27 ITR 684referred to.
From the Judgment and Order dated 2-2-1970 of the Bombay High Court in I.T. Reference No. 54/63) V. Rajagopal and A.G. Pudissery for the Appellant.
This is an appeal by an assessee on grant of a certificate of fitness by the Bombay High Court under section 66A (2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922-hereinafter referred to as the 1922 Act.
We are concerned in this case with his assessment for the assessment year 1958-59-corresponding accounting year being 1st April, 1957 to 31st March, 1958.
The Income tax Tribu- nal made a composite order disposing of the assessee's 640 appeals in respect of two assessment years i.e. 1958-59 and 1959-60.
In respect of the assessment year 1958-59, a reference under section 66(1) of the 1922 Act was made by the Tribunal to the High Court.
The High Court by' its judgment under appeal which is reported in Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Bombay v. P.K. Badiani(1) has answered almost all the questions.
But he strenuously urged before us for reversal of the High Court judgment in regard to question No. 1 which was re- ferred at the instance of the Commissioner.
He had a mutual open and current account in the books of the Company--the accounting year of which was the calendar year i.e. commencing from January and ending in December.
The Income-tax Officer' treated the withdrawals made by the assessee as advances or loans given by the Company to him and taxed the amount as dividend under section 2(6A)(e) of the 1922 Act.
The said amount was within the total figure of accumulated profits in the hands of the Company at the relevant time, i.e. 31st December, 1956.
The said amount had been debited in the profit and loss account of the Company for the account- ing year 1966 leaving a balance of Rs. 6,641/- only in the profit and loss account.
The Appellate Assistant Commis- sioner of Income-tax treated the entire sum of Rs.2,43,111/- as the amount of accumulated profits possessed by the Company.
It is a well known concept of the taxation law that the term 'profits' in the various sections of the Income-tax Acts have not got the same meaning.
In Palmer's Company Law, Twenty First Edition at page 662 the distinc- tion between profits, divisible profits and profits avail- able for dividend has been pointed out.
Computation of income for purposes of assessment of income-tax is based on a variety of artificial rules and takes into account several fictional receipts, deductions and allowances ..............
The same view has been expressed by this Court in Gobald Motor Service (P) Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Ma- dras(3).
It would appear from the report of the Taxation Enquiry Commission 1953-54 Vol. II as to what is the nature of the depreciation allowance; vide Chapter V, page 74.
It would thus be seen that by way of an incentive for installation of new machinery and plants initial depreciation allowance of 20% was replaced by a develop- ment'rebate of 25%.
But it was, like grant of export rebate by way of incentive to make more exports, in the nature of an incentive for setting up new machineries and plants.
In our opinion it was meant merely to reduce the tax liability of the assessee in order to give him an incentive to instal new machineries or plants.
Says the learned author in the above book at p. 746 thus: "There is still widespread misapprehension as to the precise significance of the depreciation charge.
It is often deemed a more or less imagi- nary and hypothetical :element, and is sharply contrasted with the regular "out-of-pocket" oper- ating costs.
As a matter of fact there is nothing at all imaginary about depreciation as a cost of business operation and at bottom it is just as much 'an out-of-pocket cost as any other.
The deprecia- tion charge is merely the periodic operating aspect of fixed-asset costs, and there is no doubt as to the reality of such costs.
The Calcut- ta case seems to be one of a property-holding company, the profits of which were assessable under section 9 wherein the question of depreciation was not relevant.
The view expressed by the Gujarat High Court seems to be reasonably plausible and correct and for the purposes of this case we shall assume it to be so.
Yet, we do not feel persuaded to accept the argument of the assessee and equate the initial depreciation or the develop- ment rebate with the normal depreciation.
In our opinion such an allowance is in no sense a deductible item of cost or expenditure in the process of settlement of the commer- cial profits.
It has been stated at page 794: "The acceptance of the contention would necessarily postulate reading in section 2(6A)(c) the words "accumulated profits as are liable to be taxed under the Act".
During the course of the arguments of this appeal, our attention was directed to a new facet of the question under consideration and that is this.
Mere transferring the sum of Rs. 2,36,470/- by debiting it to the profit and loss account to the development reserve account did not amount to the capitalisation of profits.
Buckley on the Companies Acts, thirteenth edi- tion, has pointed out at page 907 "Profits carried to re- serve do not cease to be profits unless and until they are effectually capitalised".
The learned and the noble Lord said at page 398: "I think we must look both at the 'substance and form of the transaction ........
When a crowd assembles and there is an uproar and people are            killed and injured, it is only natural for others to rush to            the scene with whatever arms they can snatch.
Some may have            an unlawful motive but others may not, and in such            circumstances it is impossible to say that they were all            motivated by a common intention with prior concert.
The High Court therefore had two appeals before it, one against the acquittals of nine persons under section 302/149 and the other by the same persons against their convictions under section 325/149.
The convictions of these nine persons were accordingly altered to ones under section 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code and the lesser sentence of transportation was given to each.
The Appellants-Revenue have filed this appeal u/s.260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, raising purportedly certain substantial questions of law arising from the order of the ITAT, Bangalore Bench `B', Bangalore, dated 25.01.2017 passed in IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2015 (Dy.Commissioner of Income Tax vs. M/s.Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt. Ltd.,) for A.Y.2010-11. 2.
We find that the DRP has given the details of RPT of all the 10 companies at page 11 and therefore the following three companies will be excluded as not satisfying the tolerance range of 15% RPT filter. (i) Fortune Infotech Ltd.  RPT 25% (ii) Icra Online Ltd.      RPT 19.61% (iii) Sundaram Business Services Ltd. RPT 29.44% 13.
Further in the case of Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Seg.) the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Kodiak Networks (India) Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in IT(TP)A No.1540/Bang/2012 has considered the functional comparability and found that this company is not comparable with a captive service provider.
At the out set, we note that the comparability of M/s Eclerx Services Ltd. has been examined by the Special Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Maersk Global Centres (India) (P) Ltd (supra) in para 82 83 as under: 82. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 83.

Intake of nicotine either through smoking or chewing tobacco may lead to hypertension and should be avoided.
Consistent use of tobacco, gutkha, khaini, etc. has been linked to various types of cancer.
It is caused due to inadequate secretion of the hormone insulin from pancreas.
Lack of insulin causes increase of sugar in our body leading to the condition called diabetes mellitus.

These are classified as anti-virals, anti-fungals, anti-protozoals and antibiotics according to the group of microbes they act upon.
Patients suffering from such diseases that are communicable should be kept in a clean environment isolated from others.
In addition to taking the prescribed medication, doing regular exercises and taking high fibre diet can help one to control hypertension.
These diseases cause disability, loss of income, disruptions in family environment and poor quality of life in the most productive years.
The balanced diet includes fruits and vegetables, preferably locally available and seasonal, wholegrain products (including pulses), milk and milk products.
Inadequate sleep leads to changes in blood pressure, increase in stress level and disturbance of what is called the biological clock.
People who undertake physical exercise and yoga activites daily keep themselves physically fit, feel happy and do not put on excess weight.

Hamza enjoyed eating healthy food such as fruits and vegetables that contain vitamins that help the body fight germs and infections.
Besides, he was good in studies and got appreciation by his teachers and therefore, he was the teachers’ favourite student.
Ahmed’s father then disclosed that Ahmed was not well so he won’t be coming for a few more days to school due to food poisoning.
They told him that eating nutritious food has a positive effect on our body and it is important to maintain a good diet for our balanced growth.
In a few days he was normal again and he started playing well in sports and got good marks in education.
Now he realised that eating nutritious things protects us from all diseases, and therefore he just had junk food once in a blue moon.
Besides, Ahmed went to Hamza and said, “Thank you for helping me realise not to eat junk food and we should follow a healthy balanced diet.”
Once upon a time there was a person who had a fruit shop, but sales weren't going too well, because people preferred food rather than healthy food.
One day, their mom lovingly explained to them not to eat junk food and told them if they do not stop eating junk food their eye sight will become weak.
One day something unusual happened to Ahmed.
His mum saw a glimpse of him taking the chips.
Suddenly, he had a terrible stomach ache.
All the students were astonished to hear this news.
When Ahmed finally came to school, everybody welcomed him.
Ahmed realised that health is our wealth.
After some days everybody in the town started to feel much better.
That lesson had taught them to not abuse junk food.
On the other hand, Ahmed was neither good in sports nor in studies, and always got scolded by his teachers for not completing his class work on time and achieving the desired results in exams.
After some months, everybody within the town fell sick due to not caring about their health, in order that they all realised that they needed to eat healthier, and began to eat fruit and vegetables.
Once upon a time, there lived a boy named Hamza who ate healthy food.
However, his best friend Ahmed, who also studied in the same class, only loved junk food.
Hamza was always conscious about his health and he used to bring healthy snacks to school.
Hamza was very active in sports and always won races due to his good performance.
He sneaked into the kitchen, opened the cabinet and took out four packets of chips.
Ahmed went to the balcony of the house and gulped all the chips in minutes.
After that he came to his room and started playing a video game.
His cries brought his mother into his room and he was taken to the hospital by his parents.
The doctor diagnosed food poisoning and admitted him in the hospital for treatment.
When Ahmed didn’t come to school the next day, the kids in his class, including Hamza, wondered where Ahmed was.
After a few days, the teacher called Ahmed’s parents to ask about his constant absence from school.
The next day, the teacher told the class that Ahmed had got food poisoning.
During recess, every single student advised him to make better food choices and eat in a healthy manner.
The fruit seller was very happy to sell his products and to assist people to be healthy.
A weight-loss-independent beneficial effect of exercise on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) management has been reported, but the underlying mechanism is unknown.
To help determine this mechanism, the effects of exercise on individual tissues (liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle) were retrospectively studied.
The weight-loss-independent benefits of exercise include anti-steatotic and anti-stiffness effects in the livers of patients with NAFLD.
We investigated the effects of exercise on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that were not related to weight loss.
Weight loss, as the result of lifestyle modifications, including dietary and exercise therapies, remains the cornerstone of NAFLD management.
As a result, significant improvements in NAFLD have been achieved following exercise interventions, in the absence of significant weight loss.
The participants performed aerobic exercise of progressively increasing intensity, comprising fast walking and/or light jogging, and the most appropriate amount and intensity of exercise was recommended for each participant according to their daily condition and fitness goals by the trainers in an initial training session.
Myostatin concentration has been shown to negatively correlate with lean mass in healthy adults, high levels can reflect an age-related reduction in muscle mass, the concentration is reduced by aerobic exercise, and myostatin is involved in the onset of insulin resistance as a result of lack of exercise.
Data from Japanese obese men with NAFLD in a 3-month exercise regimen were analysed and compared with those in a 3-month dietary restriction program designed to achieve weight loss.
These benefits seem to be acquired through the modification of inter-organ crosstalk, which is characterised by improvements in organokine imbalance and reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress.
In particular, a level of dietary restriction has been recommended that aims to achieve the maximum calorie deficit in a short period of time.
Because the optimal exercise prescription for patients with NAFLD has yet to be established, a number of studies have recently investigated the type and amount of exercise that would be most appropriate.
The underlying mechanism was studied in a smaller subcohort.
We found that exercise had considerable weight-loss-independent benefits for the liver through a number of mechanisms.
This suggests that exercise is important for NAFLD patients, regardless of whether they lose weight.
The use of exercise alone was not recommended as a therapy for NAFLD until quite recently.
Previously, it had been just an add-on to a dietary approach to achieve a calorie deficit.
However, the weight-loss-independent effects of exercise have recently received a great deal of attention.
Therefore, we wondered whether the weight-loss-independent benefits of regular exercise include an anti-stiffness effect.
However, the mechanisms underlying these potential benefits remain to be determined.
Participants in the exercise groups took part in an aerobic exercise program.
My favorite Obama quote: “Michael and I also want to… uh… acknowledge… uh… uh… uh… your son Jack, who deployed today.”
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.
I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best games ever that I have played!
But I have some problems…
I’d always heard of Mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple of months ago, and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists right now.
Anyway, those were just my thoughts.
Happy New Year’s everyone!
I hope the new year treats you well.
Now for this one, it’s kind of hard, because the enemies are so cool for this game, but... If I had to choose, I’d say I like the clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not the only enemy in the game that doesn’t have a single other variation from what I remember.
Honestly, I wasn’t going to make one, but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I disagree with a lot of others’ lists.
Not to say that my list is right, because this is all subjective anyway, which is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
Yay!
In my opinion, Lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind I’ve only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of episode 3).
Unlike her father, Lily tries to work with Lee and for the most part the group.
She does what she has to.
She is a bit of a bitch, because she has to.
I only have 1 problem with Lily.
She killed Carly.
If you could get Ben to confess…
Yes, I got spoiled on that and a few other things.
Ben is useless.
He is what looks like a college student, yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7.
Please don’t downvote me into oblivion if I missed something.
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats.
So 4 isn’t really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kind of sucks in my opinion.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who has lived both as a woman and as a man.
(Not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
So that’s kind of neat in my opinion.
I don’t think he did the role justice.
I feel before Neo figured it out, the way he was speaking was ok, but after… in my opinion, he should have gone full Hugo Weaving speech.
I just wanted to share my opinion not being a United fan, on the game against Burnley.
(Not that many of you will care).
McTominay - sheesh, what a guy.
I thought that Shaw was solid.
Now you’ve got two good left backs in good form.
Also I wanted to say AWB had a much better game, I thought.
After the shitty games and Dalot playing well I personally thought AWB improved a lot.
Haha.
Oh my god, it’s terribly funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can only drop at 4-6,
Yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues, but for me I can live with those issues but not this.
Please change!
It’s kind of an odd question in my opinion, but I have a ball python who I just got to eat frozen/thawed for the first time (yay!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I’ve tried frozen/thawed large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
It could be a fluke though.
I know it’s like a meme or something of “Dark Souls player complains about the combat” or something similar, but I just don’t get the combat.
I can do DS3 Deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately.
I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.
Oh my God!
Why do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they don’t have any idea of how a torrent even works (it’s so damn easy though!).
Comments like “The link doesn’t work”, rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
You’re just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤 Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So I get tipped on the app, they gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the application after?
What the fuck is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before, but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was less than the app tip...
If you are tipping both, tip both.
Not going to lie, Teamfight Tactics is a good mode, but it’s like Hearthstone a good game to play on your phone, not something to grind out all day all night, like what the fuck?
It’s not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on, prep up and alt tab until it’s next time you can do anything).
Any thoughts?
I know it’s a scientific things and all, but some of the posts there are just too much.
Learning dream languages?
What the fuck?
And some bloke is saying “I tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didn’t lucid dream?!” every few hours.
Maybe the posts are just getting a little too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like “Dear lord, what the fuck is happening, ooh”.
So I am a first time cup user, and I got the Saalt cup at Target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today, and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold + 17 year-old virgin = ow).
I got it in with the 7-fold, and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how the fuck am I supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails?
In one way, it kind of helped me find the cup lowkey grip, but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping.
I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes.
Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop).
Then I walked back and forgot my groceries.
I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill.
I live on a hill. Down. In the middle, really.
I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco.
So I walked back and got them.
No crime round these parts.
Not much, anyway.
I didn’t think about nails...
Is he going to tell her?
If so how would that conversation go down?!
Okay, what the fuck! Arlo now knows Sera (I don’t know how to spell her full name) is John’s weakness.
First of all, we’ve seen they are greedy as fuck (OK, not as much other mobile studios, but still).
Second, the game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high-end phones).
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
What the fuck are you Yanks on?

Sometimes it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me the fuck out and gives me nods similar to codeine.
Why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with whether or not a woman looks at me and thinks I’m ugly.
If that happens, I get anxious from it.
But if a women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks I’m decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
What the fuck is going on?
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisible, even if they don’t detect you, they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I should’ve just grabbed a submachine gun and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many tries, most of them being on his second phase.
His 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7th place on the last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead of 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Because I have less than 3000 points.
(I need 55 Magaki frags and I get 50 - just feel my suffering)
Also in another event with gamer764 I have around 8000 points and got 4th place and got rewards for 4th place, not for 1st.
What is it with needing 7k points or more?
Are the developers too greedy?
I hope the title makes sense.
I have a list of names “john.baker” (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 columns “john” and “baker”.
Thanks!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were going to see each other, and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday, and so I canceled it, and now she won’t stop saying sorry that’s not what she meant.
What the fuck do I do?
I told her I was going on another one next month (lie) to make her feel better, but I didn’t.
But I don’t necessarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks!
Okay, so I’ve got less than a chapter left in Gardens of the Moon and I still can’t understand what the fuck Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I’m missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots.
You all are whack.
What the fuck! I posted a literal anime foot and still didn’t even make most controversial post of the day, let alone of all time.
So huh, you can’t alpha Karthus ult?
What the fuck is this bullshit?
It would be very helpful if all of you original posters out there actually said what the fuck it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it!
Such as “now I understand why this [brand name] thing has everyone going crazy”…
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn’t mean much to me.
If it’s too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever at the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the “DFW teams are cursed” camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me too much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential what the fuck transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a PC, but in the meantime I’m using a crappy 13-year-old PC.
I got money for Rust, bought it and it took 4 hours to download, 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server.
After I hit a tree with my rock, my game crashed.
At this time it was 12:47 am and I just said fuck it and went to bed ready for a whole lot of shit today.
EM opens the door: May I help you?
Me: Yes! Why did you give your kid permission to enter my house without my permission?
EM: GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.
GT pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
My girlfriend’s face just turned red, because the treasure he found was her dildo.
My girlfriend snatches that out of GT’s hand.
GF: This isn’t meant for kids.
GT: But it’s mine - I found it and finders keepers.
EM: Give him back his treasure.
Me: Why the fuck are you not watching your son, EM, because he has embarrassed my girlfriend and entered my home without permission.
I have to break up the format “xxx.yyy” into two separate columns “xxx” and “yyy”.
Stop!
Me: Yes, ma’am.
EM: What are you listening to?
Me: Better Off Dead from Josh A.
EM: What?!
EK: mom, stop!
Me: Bett-
EM: I heard you. What is that cover? *points to album cover*
Me: Oh, I think that’s a reference to cu-
EM: *cuts me off again* to satanic ritual.
Me: No, not at all.
EK: Mom, please stop!
EM: No, EK, this is a bad man.
EM (to me): Now give me your phone.
It was at this moment I knew this was a entitled parent.
Me: No.
EM: But my EK needs it. He’s got his degree.
EK: Mom, I’m 10.
Me: *coughs* Damn!
EM: How dare you swear in front of my son?
Yes, she said that damn was a cuss.
Me: Damn is not a cuss word.
She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot and cold.
Now she’s on to another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state.
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago, we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind of disrespectful to the new boyfriend, huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd.
However, I will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her, but I can’t think of a reason why I should…
After going “uh no?”, she sends me a picture of said candle holder from her kitchen.
I of course go “what the fuck, you’re home?”, and it turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So I’m beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
TLDR: sickly narcisstic mom went into hospital for 3 days.
I find out she’s home because of a candle holder.
It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is that I let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message I sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful because of a song I made that I was sharing.
I was very flirtatious, maybe more so than I was with my girlfriend when I was first talking to her, and that has been echoing in my girlfriend’s mind.
It’s been extremely difficult for her.
We have two dogs now.
I was hoping us having two puppies to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again, because we have them to bond over, but she still can’t say “I love you too”.
She doesn’t accept when I try to give her compliments, because I’ve said rude things in the past when I used to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games, but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you, but I don’t see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trimming my nails, wearing Versace Crystal Noir and other fragrances etc., which I believe is the reason why most girls, even if they’re taken, at least are willing to have a conversation with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self-development, and even though I’ve been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, I never let it get me down and I’m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women, even though I may not have Hollywood good looks or charisma like Will Smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and I wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :-)
She’s 18 inches long and weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
I’m just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champion every 4-5 days and she’s already longer than some males get, so I’m curious!
The anime is about a main character that’s in a game, but she doesn’t realise it, but the system says she’s dead and etc.
I would like to watch the rest of it, so please help me.
Looking for an anime.
I don’t know if to others it’s strange, but to me it was.
I got Covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so I had to tell my mum.
I could’ve just lied and said it was because of sharing cups or kissing a girl, since I’m bi-sexual, but I knew my parents would be accepting...
So I told them as it was.
My mum was very disappointed, because she thought she knew me well, and though I told her everything, but now she couldn’t trust me anymore, because blah blah blah…
Basically, he was very disappointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that I didn’t feel like telling her, because it’s private to me... until today.
She doesn’t really trust me like before, but she’s ok, lol.
Today it’s my birthday, so I’m sharing my “strange” coming out story.
I am confused.
What’s going on, lol?
This is my first time with SFU e-mail.
After the semester I haven’t touched anything school-related until today heh, so I don’t know how to fix this.
So me and my friend started playing Valorant again and want us to learn communications such as heaven and all of that.
Now I know what heaven is, but I don’t know others, and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If you’re still confused, I’ll give a scenario: “I hit the Jett, she’s in heaven”, like the location.
She’s an awesome cook, does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but she’s not a good cook either, lol.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well.
She can’t be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or it’s a guy)
She’s all nice and sweet to everyone else, but she’s just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong (not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it., which is wrong.
When she is there, she doesn’t do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren’t there.
The worst part about it is that people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The “false advertising” on the A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill, where it says multiple buffs can’t co-exist.
Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this is all dumb and also kills a lot of people’s excitement.
I don’t like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star, lol.
It’s just like Zhongli.
He was fine, but everyone freaked, because he wasn’t doing enough to dumpster content and was balanced.
I’ve seen lots of people in the fandom make rude or racist comments about Liberty and it’s disgusting.
Please leave her alone.
And you do realize she’s black?
Stop making fun of the actors’ ethnic features.
It’s honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general.
It’s not even funny.
Honestly, it’s just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And it’s not even just Liberty. I’ve seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmy’s hair.
(Also moderators, please don’t take this down.
I really want people to see it, and I have done nothing wrong.
I’ve been having some of my posts randomly deleted for no reason)
(As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guacamole.)
She then told me we gave her less meat, when I brought back the same plate without guacamole.
She’s home for the first time!
She’s finally back!
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my puppy in her crate at night, because if I don’t she will poop on the floor.
So there’s already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then I have work, which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my Corgi in my bathroom at this time, because if I don’t, she will reek havoc unsupervised.
Am I the asshole for starting a fight with an old friend (strong swearing)?
Even better for me it would be:
It would be an unbelievable loss to let a broken and thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest apologies for bumping straight into a noble that half-marched in his drunken stupor down the sidewalk, straight out of a liquor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the main street makes in a month, I was invited to finish the wasted goods, lest they spoil any further.
“Yes sir! May the heavens cry before your merciful heart!”
“Now get lost! This is no place for disease-ridden vermin like you.”
“Of course my lord!”
I ran back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and further out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on Snapchat with my friend.
Me and my friend were arguing as a “joke” and then she said she preferred older guys, and my friend was (M14), and I said I’m a year older than you, and she says “what I mean by older guys, I mean aged 17” and it hurt my heart.
TLDR: My crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and I’m 16 and she’s 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here, but I don’t know if I am the butthole or entitled one this story.
This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.
I sent a direct message to the artist I wanted, but nothing for 2 months.
Like yeah, I understand they are booked for summer tattoos, but at least say “Hey I am booked for the rest of ____”.
But I was like “ok, well I am going to look at another artist’s work from this shop that does small tattoos.”
Same thing happens: no answer.
So me and my brother decide “ok, let’s go to the shop and ask, then we will at least get a answer”.
We go, and this young girl attends to us. Let’s call her Brenda.
I told her everything.
Brenda said “well you can do the tattoo with me”.
I said “I’ll be back. I’ll think about it”.
I got back in the car and scrolled through her work.
It was good work, so I went back and told her “yeah let’s do this”.
I signed everything.
She didn’t even ask for ID, which I found weird, because I had gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on.
I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.
She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.
I was like “ok, great, thanks!”
4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.
The right side of the heart was smaller then the other side, and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again.
So I reset it, and yeah oops, I was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn’t dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry, and like through text she kind of sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if she’s mad, and like she said she’s only a bit let down.
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me, and like I apologized to her and she said its alright.
Then I just told her I’m going to sleep, and she just left my message on delivered and, like, she didn’t reply until today.
How to tell whether she’s mad at me or just annoyed, because right now I’m really confused?
Would I be the asshole if I was just a bigger sarcastic asshole to another asshole?
Her tumors are beginning to open through her skin, she won’t jump, painkillers don’t help, she ate a lot yesterday but won’t eat or drink today, she hid most the day, but... it’s hard, because she’s alert.
It feels wrong, because she looks at me like “I love you.
I’m happy you’re here with me.”
But the vet said she wasn’t even supposed to live this long, and the tumors will only get worse, and even if we had done chemotherapy, it would have only prolonged it.
My friend told my girlfriend something.
She then broke up with me.
I don’t know what to do now, because she and the ex-friend were the only people that I had.
What should I do to try and regain my relationship, because she’s helped me through a lot over our 2 years of dating?
TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me because of something someone said, and I want to regain my relationship with my girlfriend.
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee, because she’s a person of color with tattoos and “fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up, because I need to protect my staff, but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex loves kids.
She was playing Captain Save a Hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman’s situation with this girl’s “crazy” baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in each other’s life.
It hasn’t even been two months!
I’m so hurt.
She never wanted to build a life with me.
I knew she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, as soon as he saw that I was weeping, answered,  “Come with me.”
Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.
Entering, he led me with him on the bounds of a great circle itself encircling a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land covered with lava pyramids, with sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life save for those imprisoned in it, who, though they surrounded us, dared not approach for fear of the master.
As my ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, cries, and explosions that made the eternal air tremble, caused by slaughter, starvation, withering, and frief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, of men, women, and children.
They’ve grown out to the point they look kind of awkward, and she’s saying I should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something I’d like better?
Aah!
She said she might have some clothes that fit me.
I’m dying!
She’s so supportive and nice, oh my God!
So, it’s 0:34 the first of January while posting this, and my sister (F14) just ruined my New Year by calling my mum fat and telling her she’s a drinker when she poured herself a glass of champagne, which she only does on her birthday on Christmas Eve and on New year.
Now my parents are pissed off, my grandparents are pissed off, and my sister thinks she was funny.
The same thing happened on Christmas Eve, and now the whole feeling of New Year is gone and I hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sorry for my spelling.
Screw INTJ’s.
Why have they got to be good at everything?
It was a mistake getting the booster the day before New Year’s.
I feel like absolute dog water.
Literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and I almost cried 🙏
I’m so happy, bro.
She’s so cool.
I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :-)
Also, happy New Year’s Eve and happy New Year everyone!
First of all, the satisfaction I get from saying I am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
A high I’ll never come off of.
Second of all, a customer comes in for the second time, mad because I didn’t do copies from a book because of copyright.
She goes “well, I called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
And I’m like ??, ma’am it’s in our policy.
I don’t care what customer service says.
She keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy”.
Like, lol, not when you act rude like that.
Our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and she’s such a cuddly, loving, little girl and I love her cuddles every night and in the morning.
I’m just scared that she isn’t going to be like that after she gets fixed.
Am I overthinking it?
Do you think since she’s in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she’ll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I don’t fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently she’s been asking me if I’ll fart in front of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and it’s weird she’s never heard me do it.
I can’t believe she saying I’m depressed looking while she’s such a shy girl and weird thinking she’s not.
So delusional.
I hate it, but they are my only friends.
She’s calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to D2 after several year, now I’m wondering:
Where do you guys sell or buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or is there a website that’s more efficient?
My friends are mean and delusional.
One is immature and shy and always pulling me down.
The other is fine, just jealous, and it’s getting on my nerves.
What to do?
This is a setup I can live with.
My boyfriend’s and my fear however is that in a few years when we’re ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own boyfriend.
I’m very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow any more pushing of the boundaries.
What do I do here?
Boundary Issues with my boyfriend’s alter.
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was up-front when we met and said she’s shit at texting, and has apologised when we were speaking for slow replies, something to which I said “don’t worry, I know you’re busy!”
The conversation seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation.
However, I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread), but she’s viewed my story and posted a story since.
It was New Year’s Eve.
So I was all ready for the New Year actually thinking positive and the changes I’m going to make, etc.
Then I see he’s posted a picture of them both that she’s taken saying “love of my life”.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face!
Ex’s boyfriend posted a picture of them :-(
Every time I ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even though she’s older, what the fuck?) and that I shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her.
She drains the life out of me.
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently I’ve been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, I could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brought herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to separate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later, we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great.
I’m so happy.
In our anniversary month, what do I see on his phone Snapchat?
I look at it again, I see Jane, but this time I can look at their conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So I just got my first bearded dragon.
He’s only a month old, and like most new owners, I’m worried about if he or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day, but so far I’ve only been able to feed him about 6-7 crickets.
I’ve tried feeding him some vegetables too, but the guy doesn’t show any interest in them.
Is there anything I’m doing wrong or is he just fine and I’m overly worried?
Then I found out about this really cool website called Complex.
They’re sort of like journalism but better, since they’re all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through Complex.
Before, I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic, but Travis Scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
Now I like Tame Impala, and I’ve started dressing weirder, I bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully I’ll wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromises himself/herself on social media?
Is it just me cringing at the Twitter posts by Albatross?
Everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
He’s making it seem like XVG is a sinking ship at the moment, and it’s doing fine.
So I have this friend in real life.
Man, the dude is known everywhere.
He’s got a solid reputation on the streets, in the jails. Everywhere this guy goes, everyone knows him.
He was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on Reddit, because I feel like I’m not really known.
How do you get hella karma?
I’m 21, he’s about to be 23.
My issue is that he seems to have no ambition anymore.
He doesn’t work and doesn’t make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an EMT.
He failed it the first time by 2 points, and I think he fears failure so he doesn’t really want to try anything anymore.
He’s been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
I’ve gotten Super Smough about 5 times, but I always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear I’m far enough away, but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
I’m using a 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helms and naked (even with tattered armor it doesn’t seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know by throwing myself at them enough times I’ll get them, but it’s slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do, but I seem to always get caught in a dumb combination or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or notice the letter I put in there, and now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you you read this sentence wrong too?
Well, now that I have your attention!
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :-)
19/F Aw shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time.
If I just want to make Draven my 1 carry, how should I do it?
I know he’s a good unit, but what items can turn him into a god?
I tried healing sword and rapid fire cannon, but I get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character.
However, his shield’s gun is overpowered and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets that’s fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate, because it got absorbed.
I don’t know about other players’ opinions, but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so he’s not overpowered enough to counter everything.
Tell me what you people think.
I didn’t think anything of it, so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him, the entitled kid started screaming “Mommy, he stole my cookies!”
At first I was startled.
I started to get nervous, and I froze.
Then entitled parent walks up and starts yelling “Give those cookies back to my daughter! Give them back!”
And I did not know what to say at first, but then something came to mind: just say “but I didn’t.”
But the way I said it was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That’s when my dad noticed (he’s old — sad he didn’t realise a little bit earlier)
He called a manager to the scene, and the manager told us to continue and he’ll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We’re both xxx majors (I’m a dual xxx and yyy major while she’s a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn’t say I’m smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I’m a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (she will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
It’s not until my next billing cycle that I noticed something was off.
I was a bit lower than normal and I keep a very close eye on my expenses.
I looked over my bank statements and there it was:
My new Prime bill.
I was super confused and got hold of Amazon’s customer support.
They helped me as much as they could, but because I was receiving my service through the phone company, I would have to go though them and figure out the problem.
The next day that I had off, I walked in and talked to a very sweet girl, who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kind of talked in circles for a bit as I tried to explain what the Amazon customer service told me.
We looked me up in their system and there I was: 2 lines, but no Prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date I opened my first line and then the second.
Both dates added up to what I had told her before.
She stared at the computer screen for a while with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tomorrow I’m no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach out all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered, it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance, and he messaged me on Friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said I didn’t change anything.
After that part of the conversation ended, I asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
He said that he’s good when he doesn’t think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him, etc.
Day 1 of no contact starts tomorrow.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster.
We used my name and I’ll credit his Instagram below.
He’s a good guy.
I’m glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and our story.
Would you guys like either homemade lore or not?
I couldn’t post this on the Fallout Reddit for some reason.
It wouldn’t let me put the photo.
I hope it’s good, guys!
Is it even possible for ITSOKTOCRY to blow up outside of the 3 songs he’s had do extremely well?
Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for a while, and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much I despise griefers, because they don’t just destroy something in a game, they destroy hours of work, and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying I’m mean if I don’t go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non-stop how I’m “mean” or a “bad person”, because I’m busy doing something so I can’t go give him his shit.
Well, I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I don’t see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy.
We do get slightly tipsy, you know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a Facebook message saying he’s ready for her to leave (she’d been there 2 hours at this point) and then he starts passive-aggressive cleaning in front of us.
He’s going through a divorce so he keeps telling me that’s taking all his money.
I didn’t give him a title as I didn’t even get one when I bought it.
It was salvaged from some guys at a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale, but I’ve long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do you think it’s not worth it?
Also, if I did want to how, would I?
So I just told this guy in my class, who was also weird as fuck and gave it to him saying “oof, I sat on it. It broke. Do you just want it?”
He’s like “no, ew”.
I have OCD and immediately got ashamed and was like “lol, why’s it gross?
It’s the same as a whole one (and along that line), like, lol, why?”, and he was like “ok, oof, it’s not” and I’m like “lol, why did you say that?”
I was saying it jokingly, but I’m afraid I looked weird.
Like what the fuck?
Why’s she upset or playfully upset that I don’t want it.
My human staff comes home tasting of sausages and cheese.
I think she has another fluff she is making treats for.
Should I be sad or angry?
What does your human taste of when they come home?
I can tell where your human has been and what they do by taste when they come back?
Anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday I finally mustered up the courage to message him.
Me: Hey, how’s everything?
Him: It’s been a long time.
Me: Sorry about last year.
I was super awkward around you, lol.
Him: lol, no, don’t worry about it.
*drum roll please*
Me: To be honest, I liked you blah blah blah…
Him: Haha, you could’ve just told me!
Next time you see me just say hi.
Do you still go to <school>?
I’m not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn’t sit well with me.
Hey guys, I just wanted to share this helpful application with you all :-D.
It’s not that I am trying to promote this application or something.
It really helped me a lot.
That’s why I thought it might even help you guys out.
I’ve seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team OVRs, and many are thinking to buy players, but can’t decide which will boost their team OVRs the most.
This application helps to calculate the OVR of your team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people (F2P players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team OVR since it will result in a huge loss of coins (because of 10% EA tax).
What’s the recommended amount of dedicated RAM I should have to server?
If you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.
You should be asleep.
Go to bed, I say.
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Star Butterfly.
She had blond hair, blue eyes and a super cute and colorful dress.
And she had a magic wand!
One day she got kicked out of Mewny (her home dimension) by her mean mom >:-( just because she made a mistake.
So she had to go to Earth.
On Earth, there was a boy named Marco Diaz.
He liked safety and he was super handsome.
Everybody at school was in love with him!
(Except for that idiot Jackie)
So anyway, Star came to the principal’s office.
He was like “Star, this is Marco. He’s your guide.”
Star looked at Marco and she was shocked.
“Wow, you’re so hot.”
“lol, thank you” he said, blushing, and he winked.
“Let me show you around the school.”
“Ok”, said Star.
So they walked around school and they became friends.
“Ok, since you’re my best friend now, I should probably tell you who I am”, said Star.
“I’m a magic princess”.
Then she took out her wand and created 667 laser puppies!
I have a question for this Reddit.
Can you provide honest answers?
I currently have a custom build PC with i7 3770k 32g@1666 RAM and single GTX 1080 GPU.
Should I get a second one for 650 euros or wait for what upcoming years will bring?
GTX 1080 SLI or save money for 11th generation Nvidia xx80 TI GPU?
I know a lot about Jailbreak.
Should I make a Jailbreak?
How many likes can a thoughtless post get as long as I like Telecaster? :l.
If you don’t upvote post you hate Telecasters and should die.
Thanks, ok.
I love Telecasters.
We should rename August to October, because he wasn’t released in August.
I’m out, boys :-)
I bought GTA4 for Steam PC and it won’t work.
It worked fine for a small year on Windows 7, and now my PC has Windows 10 and it won’t work.
I made Social Club and Games for Windows Live accounts, but it won’t work even with accounts.
It won’t work even for single player.
It won’t work after the people on screen wait in the loading screen.
Then suddenly when the game should start, it just closes the window and that’s it.
So how make it work ?
How do we get them to know they should use it?
The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse...
I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty.
I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens.
I want to own freedom...
How do we change the landscape?
What are your thoughts?
Sorry for my English being bad.
I should buy up that limited time bike for Halloween before it disappears next week.
Inside your body, deep beneath your skin, muscles, and not beneath your organs, lurks 1 (one) skeleton.
Spooky!
But wait, it gets worse.
The skeleton inside you doesn’t even pay rent!
He/she lives in your body so he/she should pay rent!
They freeload off you and don’t even do shit for you.
So you should evict your spooky boy.
Happy Halloween!
Edit: I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it has!
Thanks for the 6 upvotes!
Just small information, I’m 5’9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k, but I really can’t hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical “you should be good, but you’re not, so I’m going to give you unrealistic goals”, or should I be at 1:49?
My head hurts when I go krumping heads with other boys!
Green lighting things go all over the place too!
What should I do, doctors?!
Right, so I’ve fixed my headaches!
I’ve had to throw up some burny green stuff!
The boss says I should do that more on the battle, the place we’ve been fighting in!
I’ve got a metal stick for my trouble too!
This poem went as follows:
> My name is frog,
> I like to play,
> Out in the rain,
> All night and day.
> My skin is green,
> My face is coy,
> You look and say,
> Here comes that boy.
This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Aren’t you all tired of seeing at least the first two jumping into battle and wiping out your whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying that if they weren’t here then, well, the game would be balanced.
Well, I beg to differ, because there’s Akai with his insane disruption and Diggie with his timely ult or maybe even Irithel might be banned because of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly, the king and queen of this game are Lancelot and his beloved Fanny.
You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is.
She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo. You be a good girl!”
She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak.
Haha!
Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what?
Haha!
She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl!
You left the steak alone!”
And that is the story of me being a good girl.
Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt.
She says she is dumb not to think of that.
Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers.
Now I obviously can’t get out and shut it on the main road, so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I’ve quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothing’s happened.
My bed smells like disease.
I should probably wash it.
Please send me some tips and stuff on what to teach him.
Currently he’s doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns, because that’s the only gun he gets kills from.
I already taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
By the way, this is coming from an Iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say I should be silver and some even say platinum, because I carried a gold player).
Do you know how some motherfuckers exist?
They literally get close to you, then all of a sudden you have problems, and even though you apologize again and again and again, no it’s never enough for them.
I was in a Google Meet, but I told them I’d be back in 10.
I forgot my phone so I went to get it, and guess what, them speaking about you and backstabbing you.
You seriously don’t know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
Maybe I am overthinking, but I’d rather die alone than live among these kind of people.
Maybe I should just ignore them?
Or should I give them another chance?
Or maybe I am just weird, lol.
l have developed feelings for my best friend.
Now, the question is: should l tell her how l feel about her?
Will this affect our relationship that we have?
How will she take it?
I’ve been waiting for two years now, savings from then and I barely made 200 USD until now.
I’m still studying, and gaming is my dream… and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness from life… to be honest…
What should I get?
A monitor or a GPU…?
Some of you are so lucky to get a GPU for free on here… lol…
Am I the asshole? Me (31F) asked my kids dad (43M) to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in the kids’ room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not meant to lift too much or stretch but felt OK and thought I could do it alone.
I can’t.
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of the walls where I can’t reach.
He said yes and today came to do it.
After a bit, he said he was done and leaving.
I gave him £20 and said how grateful I am for the help.
I checked the room once he left...
Both kids’ beds were full of torn off wallpaper, drawers cracked where he stood on them.
I’ve still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent the last 45 minutes picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds.
Am I the asshole if I confront him about the mess or should I let it go and not bother asking in future?
My boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when I ask dumb questions (for example, I didn’t know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard? Just fill it”.
So I tried to do it but I failed.
Later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?”
Then when I do it myself and don’t ask him he goes “why don’t you ask me? I can teach you or help you”, but I refrain from asking, because he gets frustrated.
The last couple of calls had arguments, as he got mad, because I beat his ass in video games (even though gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked about him to lots of my real life friends, and they all ask why I continue to be his friend, and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only people who actively tries to interact with him online.
Yeah I know, my shoes don’t match.
They match the graffiti though!
I’m trying a lot of different styles, so let me know what I should change.
Hat: Sicko by Ian Conner
Shoes: Nike
Everything else is thrifted.
Ok, so I swallowed a small piece of box (?) tape as I was trying to bite it off with my teeth, and then I feel it in my ear 😭 not ear but that hole in my throat that leads to the ear. It’s just stuck there, oh my God 😭😭😭
What should I do, lol?
I don’t remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida, there’s a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100 times longer than when it’s not making a sound.
I’d describe it as that trademark desert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff, and … it’s just dude what…? Heck, it’s weird.
So maybe it’s both a sort of a paradox (life is), but I just want to know, honestly, did anyone else feel it?
I want a logical explanation please, and if one doesn’t exist, well I mean, because long before… I was “of age” so to speak… for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate, because I don’t drink, but I’ve…hmm… I’m an adult, let’s put it like that.
There’s other stuff out there, but long before that, me and my family saw a UFO.
Even my stepdad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been, and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall and, like… it doesn’t really scare me, because I think it’s the way life is.
Things change.
They don’t always have to make sense, and others say that too.
Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling:
> The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.
And so the North Wind was obliged to confer that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm autumn moon.
Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you yet again, creating chaos.
Who would win?
Please give a detailed explanation.
Ares (Greek mythology) vs. Mars (Roman mythology) vs. Svetovid (Slavic mythology) vs. Odin (Norse mythology) vs. The Big Bang (Atheistic mythology).
I am very ready.
I am very good.
I would like to apply for village idiot.
Should I get Horizon Zero Dawn or ELEX, because they are the same price right now, so what should I buy?
I’m just looking for reason.
By the way, I like open world a lot and shooters, e.g. Skyrim, Battlefield, COD, Ark Survival Evolved.
So any ideas on what I should be?
By the way, I would prefer them really quick.
Thanks in advance.
Thanks for the suggestions guys.
We are going to try to get the AK-477, because someone said it would help, but where do we find it?!
Please help with it.
We can’t do it alone :-)
I reside in Hyderabad, India, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in computer science.
I am a Canadian citizen, but for enrolment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam.
Now, the doubt that has arisen is… would my admission be considered international or domestic?
On a side note, how hard is it to be admitted to UoT’s computer science program?
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
I would prefer a hardcore clan with a plan. With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal or target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It’s not a necessity, but it would be nice.
PM me if you’re interested!
By the way, it’s my first post on this subreddit, so I might not have gotten it all down correct.
Locusts, grasshoppers, etc. can shut the hell up.
I’ve literally heard people tell me they learnt then forgot the entire Japanese language through anime.
I live in a house with a single mother whose first language is Thai and I barely heard English until I was like 4.
She would speak in Thai to me yet I don’t know any Thai.
You can’t learn Japanese though anime.
In fact I watched anime in Thai dubbed as a child.
I don’t fucking know shit.
Fools thinking they are out here saying “konnichiwa” in style, I’m contacting the authorities.
Here’s a question for you.
So you know the Panzer, Blue Gitz, the Tau or whatever?
So I, being a Mek, notice that they’ve got tanks and stuff that are flying, right, but they’ve not go the flames coming from whatever thrusters keep them in the air.
And they don’t make the beautiful roar that thrusters make.
I figure some commando would want a flying truck that doesn’t make a noise.
It’s a good market strategy.
Anyway, the question: “how do I krump gravity without a sound?”
Construction: teleport to house, for when they work on making player-owned houses useful, this would be godly to have.
Heck! Even now, player-owned houses has a permanent dummy for adrenaline building, prayer altar, and if they make it like Old School RuneScape, where you can teleport outside any player-owned house portal, this cape would be used a lot.
Hitpoints: Heal from regeneration ability increased, current perk I doubt would be used at either bossing or slayer.
This one is used at slayer at least.
I got one of my annual minds.com token ads in my mail today (I of course unsubscribed as soon as I found the option) and thought “hey, what the heck, let’s make a visit on the supposedly “alternative Facebook” that I just recently got denied for having a “non-believable name” and waiting further ID specification before I can use it again.”
And so I did and found out on the 2nd or 3rd post that The AJ Show has been blocked on YouTube,
I’m not a fan of rightwing stuff and was actually the reason I stopped watching it 2 years ago, though the small fragrance of freedom was that hard to find among the 90% national-capitalism the site has to offer, but anyhow, I got the idea of a non-censoring video site like LiveLeak but much more simple and less “newsy” that anyone can post on. No content would be removed ❤️
Hi guys.
I’m at 1500 hours right now, and my instructor still doesn’t let me solo.
I think I’m doing my manoeuvres ok, but the instructor says I still need more practice. I’ve tried my manoeuvres on a flight simulator, and my friend captain says that I should stop sending him videos of me playing GTA on my computer at 1 in the morning, although I trained hard on my flight manoeuvres.
What should I do?
I’m literally crying and shaking right now.
My friend would never do that :-(
Why don’t they make like Sesame Street for the kids, yo?
Like, it is very educational, I think kids would learn a lot from it.
I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras.
I have some questions and hope someone can help answer.
1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc.
Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about?
2. Is there enough parking for the second car?
3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to?
4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ?
It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place...
I appreciate any advice I get.
Bones says something like “switchblade on my waist don’t test”, and it was old young teenage bones, and the beat was hella mellow.
I would really appreciate this.
Finally it’s giving me an internet connection, but the only problem is, it’s so slow.
It’s capable of loading like Google, but anything else just times out.
And for some reason I can’t access my router admin page.
Really weird.
It’s just a white screen or it times out loading it, or the page becomes unresponsive!
Help would be appreciated, thank you!
Hey all, so today I was in the group chat with friends, and like four of them were roasting the fuck out of me, and at first it was funny, then my ego and self-respect got crippled after building it up for a couple days.
Haha, fun.
Yes, I know I am lonely and won’t get a girlfriend, but you don’t need to be jerk like that, haha.
I’ve searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
They could even go woah eee ahh ahh/oh eee ahh.
The possibilities are endless and I know it’s hard.
I’m just wondering if anyone knows it, thanks!
Hi there, it’s good to see you again!
*sits down*
How have you been?
*cuts a potato with my sacrificial dagger*
Wow, that’s great to hear.
*adds 12kg of salt*
Hm, there we go.
*throws a handful over my left shoulder for the devil*
Ok good, let’s eat.
*removes a small flask from my jacket and pours blood from it onto my plate in a small thick puddle*
Haha, that’s the good stuff right there.
*chomp chomp*
Do you want some? No?
Ok good *eats a spoonful of salt*
Oh! This is crunchy.
*chews and spits out bones*
Huh *licks lips*
Welp, that was wonderful, I’m pooped.
*gets up*
Thanks for having me over!
*transforms into a bat and flies away*
I’m feeling sad, but it’s okay I guess. Because medicines will help help us all.
Thank you, have a good morning and good night and good evening Truman show, haha.
Just kidding.
It’s going to be just as shitty if not worse than last year.
All these skin mods and such, how’s it being done?
I’d like to try it.
Is it player-side only?
Mods? How are people modding Battlefront 2 or is it Photoshop?
Hi, I was wondering whether or not it is worth dropping some money on pets.
Like, I saw how much some people can spend on them to get good results (like T4), and I wouldn’t want to spend that much :-D.
Currently, I have 5 T1 pets, and I wouldn’t mind seeing some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping “just” $100 would be worth it.
Is it worth dropping $100 on pets?
Towards the end of senior year and that summer, I don’t know what happened, but I got a hot body and my face was all “girl, you’ve been through some shit. Have a gift”, so now I’m pretty.
I just made a post on a different subreddit about having a nice date today, which is nice, but I am very hesitant on making friends and stuff because of the last two years.
So like, after my glow up or whatever, more people started talking to me, yeah.
And a lot of boys did too!
I never really had very many friends, so this was a huge yay!
The first boy I hung out with was really nice, but then we got high and I did very regrettable things I do not like.
Well, that boy was super happy and told lots of boys.
I don’t want to jinx it and call them out by name, but I’m talking with a company and I’m hoping it works out!
I’m excited about all things I’ll be able to do with these free promo products to help other people and possibly get them off some or all of their Rx drugs!
I’m excited for myself, because I have a bunch of medical issues that I do not use Rx drugs for and the other stuff I buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others, and it will help this company as well.
I’m ready, I’m ready!
I’m hella excited!
I might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do: my plant’s now way too small for its age in my opinion and has started to grow pistils.
Should I chop and restart or…?
I will be posting more here once I get… comfortable again.
(Self-love is important!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through - will get to them when I can :-)
In the meantime, Happy New Year!
P.S. I don’t have a Snapchat and don’t take any money, I just like to show off, you know, closet slut things :-) lol
Talk to you later, everyone!
He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.
I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No. You’re fucked up now.
What’s going on?”
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says “good lord, what the fuck happened?
I’ve got to garden.
Talk to you later”.
He read my reply, which said “I’m so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it, and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated”.
I just don’t know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him, and he will always be my first, and I’ll always talk to him and care for him, but I don’t want to be held in limbo.
I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know whenever I say “talk to you later” or “good night” or whatever I want to add an “I love you”. Just casually. To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day, just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten-fold.
I know sometimes I daydream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
It makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
To be honest, I kind of hope it is, because I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof, is it hitting me hard!
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I (I will takes days or a week to respond), but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to at the moment.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick “talk to you later” either to be honest.
Finally they seem to want to engage with me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then on the day.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on, and it’s not like we’re really talking, so I just block them.
I don’t know, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival.
I’m still “Ocean Serene”, but maybe I’m... I don’t know, that’s a tough thing to say, I never thought that my girlfriend was just a random.
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said a lot of things, I’m gonna agree that if I change, the world changes.
The advice you get, it’s always iffy.
I want to speak for everyone, but at the same time I can only speak for myself.
Also, I went to get some rum and coke.
I got coke and a few other people saw it, so they bought some coke… erm, I hope my friends are ok (that’s all you weirdos I’m talking about).
Random story I know.
To be honest, I’m not ok, but I’m surviving like usual.
Actually I’m all just a bit right and fine. Talk to you later.
Talk to you later.
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, it’s 8 hours to [redacted], 7 to [redacted].
Not a big deal.
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles, an hour’s drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] I suppose [redacted] or [redacted]’s wife ratted me out.
Maybe I should block them too.
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house, and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you, and we can see how well that went.
[me] Shit. Betrayal.
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self-gratification.
I was in a toxic relationship for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our relationship, we were great.
One day, both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
I’m going to admit that sometimes when I feel jealous, I just want her to reassure me like how I reassure her that it’s all good, but she will only reassure me once and then said “bye” or “talk to you later”.
Most of the time in an argument, it’s always my fault.
She won’t admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight won’t continue anymore.
And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”
And he said “Yeah, well I’ve got to go. I’m doing something”, and I was going to type “alright, talk to you later”, but I realized we aren’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the conversation started.
But once he said he’s doing something, my heart dropped.
Like, what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him, but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doens’t like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now, I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he wants to do that.
If he doesn’t want to talk to me, he can just fucking tell me.
I don’t know what else to put besides that I hate the current circumstance of  life I live in.
I’m going to give a little insight tomorrow.
Ok, I lied.
I have to reveal my age tomorrow, because if I don’t, it’ll mess up the story.
Um, I don’t know what to type so I’ll type a worry I have.
Um, I don’t think I’ll get the tape gun in time.
Ok bye, talk to you later everyone.
She said something like “but I want to make sure that we go as a friend?” thing and I was like “okay, I know”, and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said “of course I like my long time boyfriend”.
Yeah, whatever, right, haha.
And here’s my question...
Yesterday when I was at work, she messaged me saying something like “how’s your work doing?”, and I kind of replied to her with a cold tone saying “I’m at work, talk to you later”, and then she, kind of upset: “Okay, I mean I understand you are at work so busy, but you didn’t cut me off like this before; so I kind of get it that you don’t want to talk anymore like before.
Got it!
Bye!”
How do you get destiny delicacies?
I’ve seen a few people have them, but I’ve never got one.
I don’t know where you get them.
If anyone knows, it would be a lot of help :-)
And my machine fucking freezes up.
It’s been happening for like 2 days now...
This machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3D scanner, but 4 browser tabs on Reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% of my damn memory and 60% of my CPU power and freezes the whole damn thing up.
Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint! Seriously, what the fuck are you developers doing?
Stop, please!
If you think it’s rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying “got to go, I’ll talk to you later”, then it’s also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one-off.
Things happen.
Maybe something came up and you got distracted, etc.
But every single person ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It’s really not that hard to just say “got to go, I’ll text you later” or “so-and-so just got home, talk to you later”.
Even just “bye” or “be right back” or something!
Today I got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if I did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn’t want to ignore them just to talk to me.
I said it wouldn’t be a problem if he had just said something like “I can’t talk right now” or “I’m with my friends, talk to you later” or just literally anything.
He then said I was overthinking stuff and I should “chill out”, so I left it at that.
So am I the asshole and overthinking things?
Am I the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend after he ignored me for a few days?
So I would usually post this on r/keto, but that subreddit is so intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But, like, a girl’s got to rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
I have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere, I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, calories please”.
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their “no cheat days” mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten-free dairy-free carbohydrate dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
As far I as I know, the concept of mini-album is only around in K-pop (maybe I-pop?).
I’m always disappointed when a long-awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5-song album.
I can tolerate a debut album, since you really don’t have a lot of material, but if you’re SNSD or something and you come out with mini after a years long hiatus like Mr.Mr, it’s kind of insulting.
I don’t know what to say, lol.
I’m pretty funny, not only because I manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often, but also because I’m just fucking hilarious to be honest.
I’m from Yorkshire, and that probably makes me cooler than you, because the North is just superior, and I’m ready to die on this hill, but I guess we can be mates.
I would really like some of those.
Ok, I’m running out of people to laugh at my jokes.
17M from the UK,
Please be able to hold a conversation, lol.
I don’t know what kind of dog this was, but it was so ugly.
My god, who would own such a thing?
Dogs with wrinkles like Pugs, Shar Peis (I don’t know how to spell it), Bulldogs, Boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all; I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally been told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness and over the nose, they can’t breathe)
And yes, I know I’m going to get shit on by all the fucking neckbeards on Reddit that just adore their snot nose little Pug.
I don’t even care.
I’m so tired of people and their dogs.
Every time I listen to him, shit makes so much sense, even though I don’t know what he is talking about.
That leads me to believe that either that guy is a genius who can articulate what’s going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something.
I mean what should I listen to if I really want to find out the truth, if Schiff is just “biased toward gold”, and that’s the reason why he is so hard on the current economy, etc.
Are boobs nice? Because, I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before.
Then he checks the oil level, saying that the oil also smells like gasoline, that gasoline and oil are mixing up together.
He opens one spark plug, sees the massive leak in there literally full up.
Let me say, oil smells like gasoline.
I didn’t smell that one.
That’s what the worker told me.
Then he call his boss, and the boss says it is not gasoline, it is just oil, “that shit smells like gasoline” 🤦🏾‍♂️
Even the worker confirmed that I’m not crazy, but ay, maybe I am.
And his worker told me he was going to seal the black thing that goes on top of the spark plug that covers it.
Sorry, my English is not that amazing.
He said he was putting a seal after draining the oil as he mentioned.
As oil drained, the oil sealed the thing so oil doesn’t drip out of it and doesn’t drip to the floor.
But it didn’t help me find the cause of why oil is getting into the spark plug, because a seal on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️
He tells me if the problem keeps on, it is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way too much oil and is causing the oil leak, that if the problems persist I will have to remove it.
Sorry for the long paragraph, but I need advice.
I need help to be honest.
My rabbit didn’t eat or drink, so I went to check him.
It’s been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food, I don’t know.
(He has constipation so I’m going to check if he poops.)
How do I sleep if I have to check on my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is going to become chaotic, lol.
I assume the time has already passed for this, but, I don’t know, I figured I may as well ask.
I kind of forgot I even had those tickets until they announced they’d be touring again today.
Now, my aunts (grandma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated grandma both before and after she passed.
When my grandma first started getting sick, my sister wasn’t the best, because she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but grandma was also scared of Covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job I couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back and forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
Would I be the asshole if I didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So I met this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dating.
Last night, everything was all right, she was happy said “good night” and “I love you” like every night.
And the next morning when I texted her good morning, she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad as fuck all day because of me but didn’t want to say why.
I don’t know what I did.
I did nothing.
What should I do?
How can I contact her?
Should I give her space?
My girlfriend blocked me, and I don’t know why.
Mine’s ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in which I have an F.
This is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I’ve done but are nowhere in the books,
This kind of snuck up on me, because I thought they were done and filed, only to check my grades and find out they weren’t.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you are going to say “I know right, I only have an 89, why couldn’t she round up? Fuck my life)
I’m going to be honest, that’s not very helpful right now.
So first off, Bard top.
What a pick, I know right?
Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like.
*my core is static/ie/RFC.
Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way.
I like to safely clear and lay out poke.
Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer.
Giving some more tank…
Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain.
I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade.
This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great.
If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy.
I’m tet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years, we’re both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It’s driving me crazy, how to deal with it?
This wouldn’t be an issue if all your servers asked at the beginning “do you guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.”
Also, why restaurants have to be set up like that? Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Hey guys, Bard main.
I just joined Reddit after finding out there are other off-meta Bards!
So I main him top.
Yes, it’s scary, but I do.
So I’ve been getting a lot of questions about my builds from friends and happy on-lookers lately!
I thought I’d share my builds!
I’m 16 years old, 5’9.
I’m new to basketball and I’d like to ask for drills I can do by myself so I can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I don’t have a decent shot nor a decent handle,
I could barely reach the backboard plus I have no friends so don’t even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why I wanted to be good at it so bad is because I just want people to know me as somebody, because right now I’m a nobody,
I want to be somebody.
P.S. I’ve never played an actual basketball ever in my life… I know, right?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising, you know) but pretty chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when I want to be), goofy, a little chaotic, big overthinker kind of deal.
Enneagram type 4, because apparently that matters (just kidding!).
I’m honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love... you get the gist :-)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist, so a program with medical school prerequisites would be preferable.
Plus, I plan to take my medical school abroad (wow, big dreams much?
I doubt I’d get in, but it wouldn’t hurt to try though).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me.
I’d be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh, and location too.
I’m short, so if my classes are far, I might as well rollerskate my way through campus, just kidding.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, you know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would’ve prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do.
The player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now, but I don’t know if I want to pursue her.
It’s complicated.
Right now its summer break, so I’m going to wait until school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person, because they don’t talk to me online, lol.
I don’t know how long this series will go, but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I don’t know how long this is going to take but probably quite a while.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I don’t have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say that if you’re a kid, like an elementary school kid and you’re here, where the fuck are your parents?
lol, never mind, fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Because I got them and no one to give them too, lmao, just kidding,  unless...
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium Sprite and a McDouble?
So I don’t know why I got on everyone’s nerves about the separate checks…
Hey, hi!
Haha... I’m new here, I didn’t know this existed until now.
I am extremely shy and don’t know what I’m doing here typing this, haha.
But hey, first time for everything right?
If we don’t click and you lose interest, then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry, lmao.
I don’t expect to get any messages, but hey, it’s worth a try.
P.S. I don’t know how to write these properly, so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format, oh my.
Oh and if I don’t reply soon, it might mean I’m asleep or playing DnD, hehe.
Never mind.
My internet is down right now.
Fuck.
Well I’m going to see if I can buy some stuff off Steam now...
Let’s hope there are still some good sales.
Okay, so I was a total noob and erased my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was going to use, but I sent Monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
Or how do you open the .key file?
Edit: never mind, I’m a complete noob.
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive Monero wallet seeds with a .keyfile?
user765123: No, I just had the “is now playing” thing show up.
A: I know.
A: Well, here we go.
A: “easily disturbed”, lol
A: Momma, help me.
A: Help me.
A: What’s the canon name?
user765123: ?
A: my name.
A: What’s the canon one?
user765123: There is none, pick whatever name you want.
A: Oh.
A: Am I a girl?
user765123: Male.
A: Argh.
<talking about their name here>
user765123: That seems like a good name.
user765123: lol
A: >:-)
user765123: (not that it really matters. I just used my real life name)
Comment
So I can guess your gender based on your post history.
Never mind… let me guess your gender instead.
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the professor is October 18.
(Edit: never mind, this part isn’t true, please disregard).
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is February 9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the professor that I’m dropping the course?
Do I also have to get permission?
I’m planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits by the way.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I really wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what?!” really loudly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “never mind”, because I felt like I was in the motherfucking spotlight.
But every time, my narcissistic mom says that it can’t be true, because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
“It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?”
Um, I don’t know, maybe it’s because we’re different people with different bodies?
To be honest, has anyone ever experienced fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn’t die and manage to kill a least one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch, but rampage didn’t pop his ult yet.
😲 What the fuck?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky as fuck fighter, and a carry that solos everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1
When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also.
I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in...
Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
Like now I feel guilty for smiling.
Never mind the fake ones shit, but fuck.
Haha. Ugh.
Why am I still alive?
lol, why the fuck does smiling hurt?
Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me.
I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible.
He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever.
I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions.
And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had.
I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting.
But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedely keep eating my food.
I do that for maybe 3 seconds.
Then I look back up.
Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds.
Edit: Yes, I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen. Useful, I know.
But ugh. They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
By the way, there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: never mind. I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance. Oops, now I’m not getting any MP!
Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!”
The message repeats every time I hit enter.
What the fuck!
I’m not cheating.
Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player.
10/10 I’m never playing again.
Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens.
I’m going to skip the Oscar-bait shit like The Post, because there’s only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Democrats making movies about how (extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) “politics used to be more polite. We need a return to the discourse.”
I’m sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas, but I’m just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns at the moment, but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior offensive line I think is a major problem, but there is no Nelson-like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there, that’s really the only situation where I absolutely stay put.
2 months ago, I bought a cheap ’95 Nissan truck.
I was only locally driving, so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn’t put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm.
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd only when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can’t rev it past 3k in my driveway without feeling like I’m going to break something,
I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it.
It’ll hit close to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule out what could be causing this power-sap, i.e. is it the air or fuel or a clogged cat or exhaust, etc. or something entirely different?
I ruled out “different”, I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone else’s narcissistic mom treat you like you’re overreacting about your period pains?
Hey! I read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangerous.
Is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2-month Boston Terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.
My friends think she said that because she was with her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up, etc.
Others think it’s a way for her to be evil, like think of me, because I’m never coming to get that charm.
I think it’s some type of hoover, good or bad.
Any insight is appreciated.
If you’re a woman, please tell me your perspective.
So confused, but she is clearly with someone else, and why couldn’t she call me back and why didn’t she respond to my text messages?
She could’ve said “I’m with my boyfriend, please don’t call me”, but she didn’t.
Just a side note: my boyfriend and I are buying a house.
We will be moving out in 2 months.
Once the papers are all finalized.
I have an Australian Shepherd, 9 months.
My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) got her at 3 months.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with, a black Labrador and a small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a Rat Terrier.
Their play style is boxing.
And one of my room mates (25M) has a Beagle.
He doesn’t like to play much.
In fact, he seems kind of scared too.
I know all of these things about my dog.
I know that it doesn’t matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise, doesn’t matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business.
What matters is that my dog is nervous.
So when I hold my hand out and tell you, “no, he’s not sitting or lying down because he’s calmly waiting for you to say hi, it’s because he’s nervous and insecure”,  I don’t mean it as a joke, and it’s not an invitation for you to say, “aw, well my dog/child is very friendly, so let me approach!”
I don’t care if your dog/child is friendly or “dog savvy”.
I don’t care if your dog “is just a puppy”.
(why the hell is that even relevant?
Is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies?).
I don’t care if your child is capable of not screeching “oh my God, a puppy”.
Can you, you know, do something about your child? And also your dog?
But with less than 3 months to go for that, I feel I’m not ready yet, but having never taken it, I have nothing to compare it to besides colleagues’ advice.
Without knowing what I know, they can’t know if I’m actually ready yet, but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this bad and it would be awesome to be done 6 months from my introductory exam.
I’m close... I just don’t know if I’m 2 months study close.
Some certified advice.
(M/5’10”/26/165-195lbs) 2 months progress, am I gaining too much weight?
I passed my FAA PPL written!
I know this sounds weird, but here’s my issue.
About 4 months ago, I had an 3700X which died after start, crashing when I tried to play games, and a day later not booting.
I sent to RMA, they confirmed the CPU was dead and gave my money back after 2 months.
After that I got an 3800X.
As soon as I tried, I got the boot code 7b, everything powered up but no reboots or video signal.
I sent to RMA this time with the store.
After 1 month they confirmed the CPU was faulty and sent me a new one.
I got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom (T) has always been the type where her feelings matter first and only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone else’s fault entirely.
For example: I needed someone to babysit our then 2-month-old for 3-4 hours.
Dad’s work had someone who had Covid.
We opted out of them watching our son and asked my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her before I set it all up, because I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its my fault and she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her days after the incident, because she didn’t call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing,
T promptly got off the phone.
I never got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to T’s narcissism.
I don’t expect an apology from T, because she never has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5 months, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2 months, he’s co-slept with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I’ve been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get a 2-month baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (currently replacing pacifier every hour).
First time mother to a sweet 2-month-old girl, and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
First time mother struggling with sleeps.
So I already have an orange golden chinchilla (Toto, 2 months old) and we have had Toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got Terri (2-month Himalayan Ragdoll) to keep each other company.
It’s only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor.
Just always going “brr rrr rrr”.
I’m not sure if she has a blocked nose, because Toto never made this kind of sound...
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
I can’t play until tomorrow but would like to know, so I can make money hunting or robbing everything and everyone.
How much do pelts sell for online?
Alright everyone, I think I mis-tagged this earlier, so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily with a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, and lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running (I have no issue with being over 12 feet from other people - I usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then I have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually I’m quietly confident going into these games but with injuries, players missing etc., I’m kind of happy if we get a draw.
I know they’re utter piss and paper-wise, we should be wiping the floor with them, but I’m just not feeling the 2/3-nil vibe at the moment!
Anyone want to talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
This is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait never mind, shit meme.
I was 6 and playing Lego Rock Band,
I decided to ask for the Buddy Holly pack.
My parents (despite being in their 40’s) said “how the shit do you know that?”
I never realised that my parents got into Weezer.
So that’s how I got into Weezer.
I genuinely don’t understand how “toxic” behavior is more punished than literally int or troll.
Well, I’ve had an account which always received those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until I got in a bad streak of losses in ranked, and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior.... And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in-game chat for toxic behavior after a report doesn’t understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait until the morning, but then I said “never mind, I just realized it’s almost 2.
I’ll just wait”.
And then he asked what would happen if I ate it right now and I said nothing.
It’s just too late.
Now he’s telling me to just say “fuck it” and just eat the cereal.
So inspiring, but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :-(
Before I realized it was 2.
Help, lol, oh wait, I can just Google it.
Never mind, lol
How to delete a subreddit.
I know your skin isn’t perfect or you’re insecure about your nose or looks.
But those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You’re beautiful, because you’re you.
Rant over.
Actually, never mind.
God, why did you give me this huge ass nose?
I’m too ugly to even rant on Snapchat, so I do it on Reddit instead.
Ok, it’s over now. Hopefully.
Can I get an RIP in the chat boys?
I was trying to go to sleep, because I couldn’t, when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked, but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says, because she only said my name in all caps and then a “never mind”.
Fuck.
I just realized I’m complaining over a 5-minute fix…
I had never heard of this “influencer” before and consider myself pretty internet savvy.
I then lost interest in her, because her Instagram wasn’t that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread, and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out, and then I took a great interest in checking in on her, because I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while:
How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her lots of money, because she claims to not be able to afford food or rent or whatever, when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers, which aren’t cheap.
I don’t like him or anything, but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my boyfriend with him.
I wouldn’t do that to him of course, but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
Me: I’m highkey liking boys more right now.
lol, this is no culture.
I’m still trying to fucking finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.
And it’s my actual birthday tomorrow, lol.
This is not meant as a rant.
It’s only just informing Oro mains that they look noobs whenever they play Oro.
Never mind, I guess this is a rant.
Never mind, it’s back up.
That’s like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying “ah, never mind, I want to eat somewhere else” as soon as they’re bringing the food out.
I played a game as Rengar and I was 6/2 and got solo killed by Anvia who didn’t have Rod of Ages or Tear finished yet.
I looked over at the replay 100 times and all I can think to my self is, if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did, the Anivia will win CNA.
Someone please explain why the fuck an Anivia is strong than a Rengar in a 1v1 when the Rengar has a gold lead?
Actually, never mind. I don’t care.
I’m just quitting this brain dead game.
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage and both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds and says “never mind”, so I just gave her mine and went on with my day.
I’m so sick of hearing the same beats of Mexican music, ahh!
Edit: I lied: the party started at 8 am and the music stopped just now at 7:30 pm.
God, if I have to go through this every weekend, I’ll just kill myself.
Edit 2: lol, 10 minutes later, never mind, the music started again.
What the fuck!
Edit 3: It started raining, so the party ended haha!
People go in the dark alone.
No one could be that stupid!
If there’s a ghost in the house, why the hell would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a little too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they’re screwed.
4. The fuck are you splitting up for?!
There’s always this one guy in horror movies that’s like: “Guys, there’s a crazy ass killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed”!
That’s exactly what the killer wants!
Basically, I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again because my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her), and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this Reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh never mind, he’s good” and “P90 is broken. I’m quitting the game”.
lol, never mind, I’m still here. I can’t sleep.
lmao, it’s just me, never mind.
Just what the title says.
Do you pick up insects and spiders with your bare hands?
I’m deathly afraid of insects and spiders, so I don’t know what to do.
I want to kill them before they get away.
Play a scuffed 24-hour WOW livestream filled with condescending undertones, belittling, and shitty half-assed ill-prepared gameplay. Throw begging, depression and sob stories on top of it and call it couples stream.
An Altarian virus, anything is possible.
In fact, that day on Onias Three, you were infected with the cell of its hosts ten days ago.
You have been in a coma, delirious.
Your fever broke this morning.
I don’t have one, because I’m 17 and haven’t gotten around to it (and no, I’m not driving, because I’m terrified) and that I haven’t gotten my gender marker changed, so no updated documents at all.
I have a passport from a while ago from before transitioning, so that doesn’t have an updated name either.
So I have no idea what to do, because I’m going to an event with them on the 14th.
If it helps, my dad’s a flight attendant (has been for like ever).
Should I cancel?
There is always next year, but, like, I’m lonely in real life, because my boyfriend is an hour away, and as much as I love my other real life buddies, I’d like a breath of fresh air :-(
I don’t know if I will.
If I do, I will be in my mid 30’s, because I want to live life my way.
But I need to have sex to have kids and that isn’t going to happen (because honestly “me too”).
I have to go camping for a scuba certification.
There is a grill and they will eat burgers.
But I am on a vegetarian diet.
(I eat some animal products but much less than I did before.
I eat 80% vegetarian)
I got pretty close with an equalizer with a little low end and high end shaved off, going into a soft clipper.
The equalizer before it makes it Slam.
I was going to try distortion and a limiter after, when I get off work.
(The limiter was highly suggested in the last post, so hopefully that’ll do the trick) I’m just looking for advice!
What should I do from here?
Someone please let me know.
You can easily get an infinite powerlock in longer fights.
I have a 4/40 Dr Octopus, and I see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and SPS, so not bad in damage either (like vision).
A very viable option for AW attack. and also arenas, as you don’t have to bait out in those small fights, because you never let them reach SP3 before you finish it.
Get ready boys.
Pogo will not open for me.
It keeps saying this device is blah blah blah… you guys know what I’m talking about.
Anyway, to fix this, I am on Android 6.0 before the security update and I have root with Magisk 16.0.
Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise, what with having a storyline that doesn’t come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and necessary amount of seriousness and comedy.
The characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert, Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events don’t always have to rely on Neptune’s presence.
Great bait, mate. I relate, straight appreciate, and congratulate.
I rate this bait an 8/8.
Please no hate,
I’m straight irate.
Create more,
Can’t wait.
We should conversate.
I won’t berate.
My number is 8888888,
I’ve taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take no more.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: Meh, ok, that’s fine.
They then use shit like A subtract 1 through A subtract 20 for variables.
In fact, I have a linear algebra book that did this... A’s for everything.
The pages were just matrices filled with A’s.
Just draw a weird shape or something - anything but that shit!
Scariest thing ever mate.
Well, well, here we are again, frustrated, angry in front of my phone.
What a neat way to start isn’t it?
All of you readers are my therapy and I don’t owe you a cent.
Perfect, right?
If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all because of your short attention span, so let’s keep it short (what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying “keep it short - I’m a genius aren’t I?”)
Well I tried explaining to my buddies that porn is kind of shabby, and yeah just bad, and you know who listened…
Hey, I just want to know what games I can run on this PC and which not.
I was a spy, and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told the jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, Mafia and Serial Killer had made their kills.
I proudly said: “I was attacked while in jail!”
Wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and asks me “You were attacked while you were in jail?” and I answer “yes mate”.
He then tells me that what I am saying is bullshit, because Serial Killer and Mafia have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously?!
Like, I don’t really care what mean, shit people on the internet say.
But when I got nobody in real life, all I have is the internet, and it does kind of hurt a bit when I just want to vent my problems.
And I’d be fine if it got maybe a single upvote and no comments, and I’d be fine.
But instead, it’s full of people saying
Oh boy, you are too dumb for the movie, boy.
The director was like “shit, it’s about the hidden meanings you have to find, boy, like you know it doesn’t spoon-feed you the film, you know?”
Like shit, why does it have to explain, mate.
Just imagine what happened, you know?
It’s not like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has, you know?
Yet when fully charged for the first 30-60 minutes, it’s always on!
Which is beautiful!
Lastly, if I do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping), the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off.
What the fuck, mate?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone, or is it just me?
In searching Google, I cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues, I am really enjoying the mod.
It’s just a fucking ball ache every single time I want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before I can puff...
Every time I log on, I want to chill away from keyword NMZ, and play Xbox and be fat, right, but lately I log on, play RS away from keyword for like 20 seconds and I get logged out, and it’s fucking annoying.
Is it my internet connection or is it the servers or what?
It’s pissing me off, mate.
Next we have my statistics class, and I didn’t realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework; and so my grade was a 70 something, and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my band class is basically easy A as it’s show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert, and so I passed that. Good game, easy, mate.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do not go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like “what the fuck, mate?” and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after, I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there.
Did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This year’s rookie game is actually going to be real exciting.
What line-ups do you want to see?
I love this show, but sadly I’m near to finishing it already.
What is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story?
I never watch movies or… so sorry about my lack of vocabulary on this though, is this called dystopian?
Well I’m really lost, but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy!
Has it happened to anyone else?
It happened to me a number of times.
So if you’re on leg 2, you have to win 10 consecutive games for the XP and coins, 10 stamina for 40 tickets.
Get the fuck out of here, EA!
Her: Oh, where’s this ice luge, haha?
Me: Probably my friend’s hotel room or wherever he can find a place for it.
Me: I came to <insert city> with my fraternity and a sorority – that’s why he’s getting it.
Her: Gotcha!
Her: What fraternity and sorority I’m in xxx.
Me: yyy. sorority is zzz.
Me: You’re interesting though.
I want to hang out with you.
When this week?
Her: Uh, maybe Friday?
Me: Ah, yes.
Me: Friday.
*one day later*
Me: <girl’s name>, we’re hanging out tomorrow, right?
I don’t like when people type huge paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me about their problems.
I don’t like when people mumble on the phone or if they ramble on, and it’s all about them.
But now it just doesn’t make sense. You only get 1 ticket per match, and if you are lucky, you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the one thing free-to-play was always able to do because of the low cost of entrance and the rewards were good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you don’t like him, use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you don’t like the new WT, then don’t play it.
Closed tech support?
It’s, 1:30am and you’re a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
What the literal fuck?
Was your heating bill too much this month so you can’t make your rent?
You mismanaged bunch of fools.
So, long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall ’22 semester, and I’m on the waitlist since April.
Housing isn’t guaranteed when you’re not a freshman, and my income isn’t enough for rent so…
There’s a possibility, I might be homeless.
My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No fucking competition.
Most men this day are thirsty as fuck.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half-assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains, they grab and grunt at everything with two legs.
And I mean that literally.
But – that’s good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24M), an accountant at a traveling company.
We ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today I called one of our agents and a girl picked up.
She was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts, and she said “yes, I will be at your company at 21:00”.
I said “ok, and at 21:00, she came by and asked who is the accountant”.
I said “I am, please follow me to the room”.
She came and I asked her how much did she bring.
She said “I have $1300 with me”, which will not cover all of their debts by the way, so I brought a receipt and wrote down the amount and the company name and then I asked her for her name.
She smiled and looked at me and said my name.
So none of my friends are answering me 😭😭
So, it’s time to make some new ones!
I’m in the mood to call, so let me know if you’re down!
Looking to talk to people around my age.
I’ve posted before so you can check out my profile for more info.
I’m a little lazy right now 🥴
Anyways, let me know what your favorite type of music is 🙃
I had been wearing Lane Bryants Lounge Bras the past four-ish years, and so this was the first time in a very long time that I wore a bra with wire.
So come Monday, I wore my new bra with wire that fit perfectly at the store, but after a few hours it felt so uncomfortable!
I am worried I wasted my money… :-(
I’m so miserable and seriously just want to cancel my trip but don’t want to disappoint my husband.
He’s been looking forward to a vacation for so long.
I’m dreading the plane ride so bad!
Luckily the flare is a bit higher and not right where I make contact when sitting, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.
I’m going to be walking around in 40 degree weather with a big angry boil on my ass.
God help me 😫
Hey, there.
I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of “you” or “your”, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
Just type out the word.
It isn’t hard.
Hi guys, I was drinking with my friends from the US and my boyfriend and everyone’s fallen asleep, and I want to play some truth or dare or drink, so if you have Discord or Kik, just message me, owo
So I just had my baby with the man of my dreams 4 months ago :-) and it felt like I was living my fairytale life.
I was in my exact vision I had, but then, long story short, postpartum with new emotions had me pull a crazy move and I checked his phone about a month ago now, only to find out he was meeting up with a  chick, doing favors for her, spending time in her room and texting a lot, all while I was pregnant.
Now he and her both say they are just friends and never hooked up (yes, I contacted her number), lol, but I don’t want to lose my man, though I also saw he has dating profiles and he says he doesn’t do it all the time.
And he won’t do it anymore.
I don’t want my baby’s parents to split, plus I love him and want our vision to carry on.
But how?
Please help.
Can I? Or should I trust him again ?
Day 17 of posting Corgi stuff (sorry for not posting for so long)
I have insomnia and I can’t sleep at night, and it’s just like I have so many ideas at night that just so many ideas keeping my up at night.
Please tell me how sometimes I can get better sleep.
Because of that, I almost failed school and because of skipped lessons, and people tell me to listen, but just, like, I talk with somebody, and then I just think of something.
I forgot what I was about to say, and I had a math tutor, but iI couldn’t focus and just also my mind is like chaos people.
Tell me.
Oh, I don’t want to take medication and I’m sensitive to medicine.
Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that.
She probably already has one also.
A real digital movie camera costs so damn much.
So I opted for an analog one.
Now, 8mm/Super 8 have an affordable price, 16mm doesn’t cost much, and 35mm costs a lot, so I think I’m going for a Super 8.
But then how does it work?
lol, I mean, I buy her a Super 8, but I should also buy her a video recorder, and some VHS… things like that.
I don’t know how it works.
Please can someone explain to me what should I do.
How do you guys do it?
It’s so scary, but I want to last forever with him, and I know I can’t tell the future, but we’ve been through so much together.
How do you guys keep it going through all the obstacles life throws at you... how?
Do you want to run some Minecraft? XD
I’m bored and my friends are busy or out right now, so...
I finished the game for the first time today.
What a wonderful and amazing game.
It hits right in the feels and fucks your mind up at times.
My ending was sad.
Kara and Alice die (I am bad at controls), North dies, Hank dies, Marcus is successful, but I let Connor kill him, because I guess I was doing kind of a role-play where Connor is the villain and the outcome is realistic.
I will try to open other openings.
But yes, the game was so good.
Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!
Maybe a little earlier, I don’t know, because I’m usually at work, but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mb/s range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more people are at home I’m going to see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60…
I am an aspiring doctor/medical student, and so seeing a lot of medicine-related subjects as early in our first semester I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!
I passed for UPLB BS Biology!
To be honest though, this wasn’t my priority program, so of course I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be a scholar, but I was also worried, because I’m not really as interested in Biology as invested I already was in Physical Therapy.
Sure, I could learn to love Biology, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year, but that’s not certain.
I will play with anyone on 2K21.
I’m an 87 over 3 level scorer. As one that will play with anyone, REP and OVR don’t matter.
I have no one to play with most of the time, and no randoms want to play with me.
Please play with me.
I promise I won’t sell.
I can shoot.
I have an 81 three, but I can shoot.
I’m a shooting guard.
I need someone who knows how to land planes on PC to help me.
That’s all.
I just need you to land the plane.
I know how to do the rest of the mission, but the plane has been messing me up for hours.
Please help as soon as possible.
My discord is SingSong254.
Contact me there, then I’ll give you my Ubisoft account information.
Thanks.
Help, I need someone who knows how to fly planes well on PC to join me.
Let’s fucking go!
What’s up guys?
I drop around 30 kills a game right now, and I’m trying to get out of low ranks and get into Platinum.
If you’re good at the game but simply don’t have a Stack, add me on Discord and we can rank up together.
Just to clarify, when I say “anything” I mean anything within the FM’s current power.
So no answers like “remove the nukes” or “boot the royals”.
We cannot do that (not yet at least…).
You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.
What do you do?
Me and my real life friends need a team that we (or especially I) can VOD review in order to learn about tarping, switching layers and positioning.
I was thinking Wolf/Soldier/Wilkinson but I’m not sure if there are any better ones.
Preferably EU as we are EU, and some stuff happening is basically exclusive to EU, lol, but I guess it could be NAE as well.
Thank you!
Looking for someone to play with right now.
No toxics and no obnoxious people.
I don’t fuck with that.
18+ NAE.
I just play for fun.
You can be bad.
I don’t care about skills 😇
One word I simply can’t say properly is water...
It actually hurts my brain trying to add the T, and I sound American if I do or still say wut-ta.
I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to say, to be honest.
I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when you meet people who drop H’s and have glottal stops.
I’m curious how likely it is that a post on my personal space will be shown to people.
Please write  “+” in the comment if you see this.
So I got a Sky Q Mini Box for upstairs.
It doesn’t work.
I have to wait until late March for an engineer.
lol
So I will be starting a job next week and desperately need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
Looking for single bedroom flats or flat-shares is a legitimate issue as three letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
Vacuum won’t stop sucking. Please send help. Is it going to blow?
Basically, if you didn’t know what that is, it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Let’s eat granny” making it seem like someone’s going to eat their nan.
However, the other example says “Lets eat, granny”, implying a different meaning to the sentence.
A pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas, I guess.
I literally couldn’t have been more at fault
I just drove straight into this woman’s Golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it).
She seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it’s my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers as well, just very minor body work and paint, maybe a small dent.
What broadband do I get?
I’ve had Virgin for 8 years, and holy shit, is it slow for £40 monthly.
Is it the old router or do I just switch to a cheaper BT or whatever?
Jeans, T-shirt, steel-cap boots, boiler suit (lol), high vis, gloves, goggles, dust mask, ear protection.
Help. I’m melting…
Edit: the heat has got to my spelling ability first. The end is nigh.
I’m sure as eggs is eggs that I’m not the only one that goes to the gas pump, and I want say £10, 9 times out of 10 it will go £10.01.
Bloody things are rigged like a slot machine, I swear, lol.
lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn’t actually laugh to.
LOL - adults and people who don’t really know how the internet works use this
Lol - I’m not sure why this came up, but it’s likely an autocorrect, but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named.
LoL - Grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
It’s also confusing because of League of Legends.
loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with “spool”, but I think it’s the drawn-out “o”.
So yeah, I think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn’t exist.
lolll - when I hear her say “loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it. but I still think that’s “loool”,
You can’t repeatedly pronounce a consonant.
So, when is Big Ben going to bong again?
Hm, mandatory title.
But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Preferably under £50!
Also, does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming (that don’t require me to stand for lengths of time).
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what I do, I literally can’t keep the dust at bay for more than 24 hours, and I am losing my mind.
It’s 10pm, 28°C, and my bum is literally melting.
Saturday session three and chat.
If this bear isn’t named Beary McBearface, we have failed as a society.
It’s 32°C here inside my flat.
I have taken the t-shirt off and soaked it in cold water.
I’m wearing it.
What genius ways are you keeping cool whilst working from home or somewhere extremely hot with no AC?
Bloody lovely fucking weather, isn’t it?
16 hours in Wetherspoons.
Okay, so I went out with my girlfriend to go to 7-11 and I had my hair in my face, a hoodie, and a mask, and someone called me he/him.
Bruh, I’m so happy right now, what the fuck (I’m non-binary and use all pronouns, but nobody has ever used he/him for me and it feels really good)
To the neighbor that went out of their way just to check on me, I appreciate that.
I just wanted to say from one Gen Z to Millennials, good on you guys.
I hope you find what you’re looking for. It’s been fun being your little buddies in life.
If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet, everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really, to be honest.
Remember, there’s a lot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that doesn’t experience a lot of positive moments, this subreddit does make me smile :-)
Damn, some people need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet, Jesus!
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kind of a lot, lol), so I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I don’t see the need, because who the fuck cares?
But now it seems that you’re all making grits without the butter and making us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were preparing to tour more plantations than Carter’s got little pills but you done gone and brought up them “slave owners” now.
It isn’t amounting to anything more than a hill of beans!
If I had my druthers, I’d have just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt something decent about history.
All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
You get along now, do you hear?
How to go from number to date?
How do I break off a relationship with my “friend”?
Basically, I put my skate account in my Instagram biography, because I have no posts on my main, and I’m kind of insecure about my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless, and people won’t expect me to be like shredded or some shit if they add me), and today I got 3 followers (girls from different towns who don’t know me).
I’m really picky though, because I don’t want to have a relationship, unless I actually feel like I’d really like the person and be into them a lot, so I didn’t follow any of them back.
Bro, I’ve been added and un-added on Instagram so many times today that it’s kind of a confidence boost, lmao.
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from people who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers, smh…
I have nothing else to say, come at me angry people, lmao.
Hi guys, I’m a casual just-for-fun gamer, playing 5-6 games a week.
Yesterday it was just pure horror division 10…
I could not win 1 game out of 6…
Like, is everyone smurfing ?
Or what’s going on?
I know people want to play the objective.
I get that, but why do you need to shush or watch full replay or every cut scene?
So basically, for my A-levels I got 82 RP and wanted to go the NUS business administration but didn’t get in, though I’m quite sure my grade is good enough, and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago… *welp* :-(
I got into SMU business administration, but I still feel damn shit that I didn’t get into NUS, so help change my mind and convince me why SMU is better than NUS, especially for business :-/
I’m most scared that in the future when I’m working, people will look down on SMU like elitism discrimination all that, I don’t know, man.
Or will they pay less or not even hire me?
RIP, because SMU is kind of 2nd best and less well known.
I would really appreciate if you all could help me out, especially those who are currently at university or have already left.
Thanks pals :-)
TLDR: the title.
Other vegans that you’re friends with tell you that they don’t tell other people that they’re vegan.
Like, they purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community, because they are probably the people that would be more gentle with their words, which is what some people need in order to listen.
I’m a very straightforward, no sugarcoating type of person, and although some people appreciate it, a lot more get upset and start trying to put words in my mouth and twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like €300 worth of fake internet points, like, what the fuck are you doing, honestly? lol
Why would you give awards to people? lol
I just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre-googling and confirmed the time that I’ll be there.
If she gives any further resistance, I think I’ll just next her, ignore her, not respond to her, agree with her that she can’t handle the place, or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first freaking date.
Yes, I agree things like Tumblr made-up identities are weird, and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted, calling people snowflakes is just weak.
Give yourself a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without any unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series! Props to you!
The New Year’s Eve Raticate with a hat.
I haven’t found him anywhere yet.
Does anyone want to raid?
I need a few people quick.
Stop.
I think what I am trying to say… this game is not hard.
Don’t make it hard yourself.
The main objective, as I understood, is to get the dragon, and don’t die before that.
Even better if you outfarm your opponent.
Just don’t die.
And trades in lane… if you see the enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights, but he was out of town.
So we couldn’t do that, and now he’s back in town, and I asked him what he’s doing on New Year’s Eve and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers from our work.
And like, he didn’t offer an invite, and then he said if he cancels with them, would I like to come over, and I just said I don’t know what I’m doing yet, so I don’t know.
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There are going to be people on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid.
Hey, the regulars!
I just wanted to say that I love the group channel, it’s amazing, and love your own channels as well.
I love all your videos, and I have a suggestion for a video for the channel:
Do a Minecraft build battle and whoever loses there, the other people get to write something on their Twitter, lol.
I hope you like my idea and can use it for a video.
I have a group chat.
It’s on Discord for people who are bored or want to chat about anything.
We already have some people who chat and stuff about anything.
It’s chill, edgy, and if you want to join, comment and I’ll direct message you the link.
I just kind of realized that I’ve never had New Year’s Eve plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that…
I recently realized that I still don’t have enough friends to have one for my 21st coming up…
I don’t know why I didn’t clue into this though.
Like, I never thought about how people have traditions for this night, besides my sister, who goes out to her friends’ every year.
It’s funny that Covid isn’t affecting my New Year at all…
Is anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway, I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight, lol.
Hello, I’m looking for people to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
Just please be aware that I’m not very good at upholding conversations. uwu F/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the Word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the “aaa” word, and I want to yank four words without selecting the spaces after “ddd”:  > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like, I see videos on YouTube on it.
But like, I can’t see any mention on the design notes, etc.
Where do people get the information from?
DM me to debate.
Please be well learned in your belief.
I want DMs, because it’ll get deep and I can’t reply to 300 people like that.
Also, I need 500 characters so here come the blah blahs.
I’m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I’m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl, but I am saying that they won’t like to do it, because they are humans with their own choices, and not agreeing to be a girl isn’t making them a women anti.
Like, how many guys around you would be willing to be turned into Disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time but how much time?
And maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
But knowing this isn’t making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they are asked to do all this.
I wouldn’t like it if you tried to make me a man and wanted me to dance in front of so many people, even though I am a tomboy.
Is anyone missing me?
If you miss a Reddit friend, read this.
It could be me!
So I just hopped on PC from PS4, not even 2.5k games played there.
I played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a keyboard and mouse, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with people 2000 kills and predators even.
Yet I haven’t even a hundred games played and about 80 kills with all characters.
I’m not really having fun anymore.
I can’t improve if I get shit on every game.
I see a lot of people on here who seem hella sad, so if you’re really sad, I’m up for a chat.
So yeah if you are up for a chat, or long-term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so.
So I always see people talk about sending designs and edits to Affinity, but how do I do that?
I’ve worked at OD for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it.
Like not even the print suppliers.
We do every type of editing in store and I hate it.
Like we’re out here doing stuff that I’m pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to Affinity based on what I see on here.
But yeah, is more of this information on the store portal or where can I learn more?
I’m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last-minute, rude customers :-)
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k, and I was like “Hell no, that’s not worth 100k”, like bruh.
Why do people find the new set expensive?
I know the girl I posted about is a troll people, but oh well, she’s got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down.
It is the bar with the team composition and the status of each character that is used to follow “report team” (like in the actual World Cup).
It can be tweaked down to not reveal too much information about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier, and you won’t have to use tab.
Hit me up with a chat message.
Tell me about yourself and we can go from there.
I don’t understand how people can build what they do...
I love building but I guess my creativity isn’t well tuned as a lot of people’s is, and it bothers me that I can’t build amazing stuff.
I know I could if had the creative side, ugh!
I just tend to give up after a while and settle for simple crap to pass for ok.
I care about how I affect people a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in conversations with big groups of people, which is related to ADHD.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kind of stand-offish to people I don’t know.
I’ll try to act like I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me but drunk people will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all are ADHD things though, because of rejection sensitive dysphoria.
I’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent.
I can have a really, really, really flirty personality at times.
I remember in high school, my friend’s mom said I had the “personality”, so I’d probably be the first to have a boyfriend.
But when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds her accountable, she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects anyone/everyone who doesn’t agree with her and screams about how she doesn’t care.
Or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck”.
She’ll never take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite.
All the things she screams at people to not do to her, she turns around and does the exact same rude, petty shit to anyone/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her.
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts just like my mom, and my mom can’t stand it/accept that
So she becomes downright nasty.
In class, I’ve usually been really quiet, but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click with in class and be really, really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen B, feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk though.
I’ve always been a smiley, happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have ADHD.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really, really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk - I heard people with ADHD are both.
Could I be ISTP?
Help type me please.
I don’t know if people would even want to.
I just want to know if that’s allowed, and if not, where would be a good place to post that.
(I’ve watched Dragonmar and other people’s videos but that would be hard to be a me-specific video on there)
Like in a good way though.
Some people are just indescribable.
I haven’t done this before, but I’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like…interests :-)
We can definitely talk about anime (especially romance - I’m a sucker for it), we can talk about games and go into detail about lore and stuff, creepy stories go hard, and really I’m just down for anything :-)
I’m not gonna be weird so long as you’re not weird.
Any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah… if I didn’t do this right let me know :-)
Oh and I’ll absolutely talk more on Snap.
The part I’m humming is like “word word word wo-o-o-ord” twice.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like “fly-y-y-yyy.”
I’m pretty sure it’s a popular song; I’ve heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah, to be honest it is.
I care about a lot of people and I can’t just... make people be happy.
But like… I want to :-(
I just want to make everybody I care about happy.
Like, is that too much to ask?
I think that some people here are AI or something.
smh, don’t even try.
I can do that by myself 🤠
Hey, F/19, bored as fuck.
I enjoy talking to new people.
Hit me up!
I started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90’s.
She said everyone was watching wrestling back then, and it was a cool thing.
Now no one gives a shit 😭 (I don’t really blame them sometimes).
I asked her “why do you think people stopped liking it”, and she said “because it’s garbage.
It’s come on Fox on Fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hits, I change the channel”.
I had to include that in there, because she’s so funny 😂😂😂
Anyways…
Hey, I can’t fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting.
Hit me up if you think we could hit it off well.
I hope we have a great time, future chat buddy ;-) 😁
It’s kind of weird, I’m not going to lie.
These motherfuckers can outrun, outswim or outstam (through venom) anything that tries to get them.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
I just finished the show so I’m a little behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much, lol.
Also by sidestory I mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
My favorite Obama quote: “Michael and I also want to… uh… acknowledge… uh… uh… uh… your son Jack, who deployed today.”
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.
I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best games ever that I have played!
But I have some problems…
I’d always heard of Mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple of months ago, and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists right now.
Anyway, those were just my thoughts.
Happy New Year’s everyone!
I hope the new year treats you well.
Now for this one, it’s kind of hard, because the enemies are so cool for this game, but...
If I had to choose, I’d say I like the clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not the only enemy in the game that doesn’t have a single other variation from what I remember.
Honestly, I wasn’t going to make one, but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I disagree with a lot of others’ lists.
Not to say that my list is right, because this is all subjective anyway, which is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
Yay!
In my opinion, Lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind I’ve only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of episode 3).
Unlike her father, Lily tries to work with Lee and for the most part the group.
She does what she has to.
She is a bit of a bitch, because she has to.
I only have 1 problem with Lily.
She killed Carly.
If you could get Ben to confess… Yes, I got spoiled on that and a few other things.
Ben is useless.
He is what looks like a college student, yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7.
Please don’t downvote me into oblivion if I missed something.
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats.
So 4 isn’t really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kind of sucks in my opinion.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who has lived both as a woman and as a man.
(Not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
So that’s kind of neat in my opinion.
I don’t think he did the role justice.
I feel before Neo figured it out, the way he was speaking was ok, but after… in my opinion, he should have gone full Hugo Weaving speech.
I just wanted to share my opinion not being a United fan, on the game against Burnley.
(Not that many of you will care).
McTominay - sheesh, what a guy.
I thought that Shaw was solid.
Now you’ve got two good left backs in good form.
Also I wanted to say AWB had a much better game, I thought.
After the shitty games and Dalot playing well I personally thought AWB improved a lot.
Haha. Oh my god, it’s terribly funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can only drop at 4-6, Yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues, but for me I can live with those issues but not this.
Please change!
It’s kind of an odd question in my opinion, but I have a ball python who I just got to eat frozen/thawed for the first time (yay!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I’ve tried frozen/thawed large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
It could be a fluke though.
I know it’s like a meme or something of “Dark Souls player complains about the combat” or something similar, but I just don’t get the combat.
I can do DS3 Deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately.
I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.
Oh my God!
Why do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they don’t have any idea of how a torrent even works (it’s so damn easy though!).
Comments like “The link doesn’t work”, rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
You’re just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤 Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So I get tipped on the app, they gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the application after?
What the fuck is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before, but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was less than the app tip...
If you are tipping both, tip both.
Not going to lie, Teamfight Tactics is a good mode, but it’s like Hearthstone a good game to play on your phone, not something to grind out all day all night, like what the fuck?
It’s not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on, prep up and alt tab until it’s next time you can do anything).
Any thoughts?
I know it’s a scientific things and all, but some of the posts there are just too much.
Learning dream languages?
What the fuck?
And some bloke is saying “I tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didn’t lucid dream?!” every few hours.
Maybe the posts are just getting a little too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like “Dear lord, what the fuck is happening, ooh”.
So I am a first time cup user, and I got the Saalt cup at Target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today, and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold + 17 year-old virgin = ow).
I got it in with the 7-fold, and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how the fuck am I supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails?
In one way, it kind of helped me find the cup lowkey grip, but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping.
I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes.
Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop).
Then I walked back and forgot my groceries.
I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill.
I live on a hill.
Down.
In the middle, really.
I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco.
So I walked back and got them.
No crime round these parts.
Not much, anyway.
I didn’t think about nails...
Is he going to tell her?
If so how would that conversation go down?!
Okay, what the fuck!
Arlo now knows Sera (I don’t know how to spell her full name) is John’s weakness.
First of all, we’ve seen they are greedy as fuck (OK, not as much other mobile studios, but still).
Second, the game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high-end phones).
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
What the fuck are you Yanks on?
See also: (on an article about how it’s “40 degrees in some parts of Europe”) > what the fuck, lol, that’s not hot at all.
Put on a jacket, dummies!
(“[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16°C”) > Oh my God, that’s really cold.
I’m never moving to canada.
Sometimes it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me the fuck out and gives me nods similar to codeine.
Why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with whether or not a woman looks at me and thinks I’m ugly.
If that happens, I get anxious from it.
But if a women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks I’m decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
What the fuck is going on?
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisible, even if they don’t detect you, they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I should’ve just grabbed a submachine gun and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many tries, most of them being on his second phase.
His 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7th place on the last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead of 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Because I have less than 3000 points.
(I need 55 Magaki frags and I get 50 - just feel my suffering)
Also in another event with gamer764 I have around 8000 points and got 4th place and got rewards for 4th place, not for 1st.
What is it with needing 7k points or more?
Are the developers too greedy?
I hope the title makes sense.
I have a list of names “john.baker” (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 columns “john” and “baker”.
Thanks!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were going to see each other, and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday, and so I canceled it, and now she won’t stop saying sorry that’s not what she meant.
What the fuck do I do?
I told her I was going on another one next month (lie) to make her feel better, but I didn’t.
But I don’t necessarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks!
Okay, so I’ve got less than a chapter left in Gardens of the Moon and I still can’t understand what the fuck Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I’m missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots.
You all are whack.
What the fuck!
I posted a literal anime foot and still didn’t even make most controversial post of the day, let alone of all time.
So huh, you can’t alpha Karthus ult? What the fuck is this bullshit?
It would be very helpful if all of you original posters out there actually said what the fuck it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it! Such as “now I understand why this [brand name] thing has everyone going crazy”…
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn’t mean much to me.
If it’s too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever at the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the “DFW teams are cursed” camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me too much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential what the fuck transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a PC, but in the meantime I’m using a crappy 13-year-old PC.
I got money for Rust, bought it and it took 4 hours to download, 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server.
After I hit a tree with my rock, my game crashed.
At this time it was 12:47 am and I just said fuck it and went to bed ready for a whole lot of shit today.
EM opens the door: May I help you?
Me:
Yes!
Why did you give your kid permission to enter my house without my permission?
EM:
GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.
GT pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
My girlfriend’s face just turned red, because the treasure he found was her dildo.
My girlfriend snatches that out of GT’s hand.
GF:
This isn’t meant for kids.
GT:
But it’s mine - I found it and finders keepers.
EM: Give him back his treasure.
Me:
Why the fuck are you not watching your son, EM, because he has embarrassed my girlfriend and entered my home without permission.
I have to break up the format “xxx.yyy” into two separate columns “xxx” and “yyy”.
Stop!
Me:
Yes, ma’am.
EM:
What are you listening to?
Me: Better Off Dead from Josh A.
EM: What?!
EK: mom, stop!
Me: Bett-
EM:
I heard you.
What is that cover?
*points to album cover*
Me:
Oh, I think that’s a reference to cu-
EM: *cuts me off again* to satanic ritual.
Me: No, not at all.
EK: Mom, please stop!
EM:
No, EK, this is a bad man.
EM (to me): Now give me your phone.
It was at this moment I knew this was a entitled parent.
Me:
No.
EM:
But my EK needs it.
He’s got his degree.
EK: Mom, I’m 10.
Me:
*coughs* Damn!
EM:
How dare you swear in front of my son?
Yes, she said that damn was a cuss.
Me:
Damn is not a cuss word.
She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot and cold.
Now she’s on to another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state.
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago, we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind of disrespectful to the new boyfriend, huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd.
However, I will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her, but I can’t think of a reason why I should…
After going “uh no?”, she sends me a picture of said candle holder from her kitchen.
I of course go “what the fuck, you’re home?”, and it turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So I’m beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
TLDR: sickly narcisstic mom went into hospital for 3 days.
I find out she’s home because of a candle holder.
It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is that I let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message I sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful because of a song I made that I was sharing.
I was very flirtatious, maybe more so than I was with my girlfriend when I was first talking to her, and that has been echoing in my girlfriend’s mind.
It’s been extremely difficult for her.
We have two dogs now.
I was hoping us having two puppies to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again, because we have them to bond over, but she still can’t say “I love you too”.
She doesn’t accept when I try to give her compliments, because I’ve said rude things in the past when I used to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games, but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you, but I don’t see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trimming my nails, wearing Versace Crystal Noir and other fragrances etc., which I believe is the reason why most girls, even if they’re taken, at least are willing to have a conversation with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self-development, and even though I’ve been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, I never let it get me down and I’m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women, even though I may not have Hollywood good looks or charisma like Will Smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and I wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :-)
She’s 18 inches long and weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
I’m just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champion every 4-5 days and she’s already longer than some males get, so I’m curious!
The anime is about a main character that’s in a game, but she doesn’t realise it, but the system says she’s dead and etc.
I would like to watch the rest of it, so please help me.
Looking for an anime.
I don’t know if to others it’s strange, but to me it was.
I got Covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so I had to tell my mum.
I could’ve just lied and said it was because of sharing cups or kissing a girl, since I’m bi-sexual, but I knew my parents would be accepting...
So I told them as it was.
My mum was very disappointed, because she thought she knew me well, and though I told her everything, but now she couldn’t trust me anymore, because blah blah blah…
Basically, he was very disappointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that I didn’t feel like telling her, because it’s private to me... until today.
She doesn’t really trust me like before, but she’s ok, lol.
Today it’s my birthday, so I’m sharing my “strange” coming out story.
I am confused. What’s going on, lol?
This is my first time with SFU e-mail.
After the semester I haven’t touched anything school-related until today heh, so I don’t know how to fix this.
So me and my friend started playing Valorant again and want us to learn communications such as heaven and all of that.
Now I know what heaven is, but I don’t know others, and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If you’re still confused, I’ll give a scenario: “I hit the Jett, she’s in heaven”, like the location.
She’s an awesome cook, does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but she’s not a good cook either, lol.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well.
She can’t be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or it’s a guy)
She’s all nice and sweet to everyone else, but she’s just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong (not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it., which is wrong.
When she is there, she doesn’t do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren’t there.
The worst part about it is that people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The “false advertising” on the A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill, where it says multiple buffs can’t co-exist.
Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this is all dumb and also kills a lot of people’s excitement.
I don’t like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star, lol.
It’s just like Zhongli.
He was fine, but everyone freaked, because he wasn’t doing enough to dumpster content and was balanced.
I’ve seen lots of people in the fandom make rude or racist comments about Liberty and it’s disgusting.
Please leave her alone.
And you do realize she’s black?
Stop making fun of the actors’ ethnic features.
It’s honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general.
It’s not even funny.
Honestly, it’s just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And it’s not even just Liberty.
I’ve seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmy’s hair.
(Also moderators, please don’t take this down.
I really want people to see it, and I have done nothing wrong.
I’ve been having some of my posts randomly deleted for no reason)
(As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guacamole.)
She then told me we gave her less meat, when I brought back the same plate without guacamole.
She’s home for the first time!
She’s finally back!
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my puppy in her crate at night, because if I don’t she will poop on the floor.
So there’s already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then I have work, which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my Corgi in my bathroom at this time, because if I don’t, she will reek havoc unsupervised.
Am I the asshole for starting a fight with an old friend (strong swearing)?
Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbelievable loss to let a broken and thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest apologies for bumping straight into a noble that half-marched in his drunken stupor down the sidewalk, straight out of a liquor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the main street makes in a month, I was invited to finish the wasted goods, lest they spoil any further.
“Yes sir!
May the heavens cry before your merciful heart!”
“Now get lost!
This is no place for disease-ridden vermin like you.”
“Of course my lord!”
I ran back down the alley I squirmed my way out of.
Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went.
Further and further out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on Snapchat with my friend.
Me and my friend were arguing as a “joke” and then she said she preferred older guys, and my friend was (M14), and I said I’m a year older than you, and she says “what I mean by older guys, I mean aged 17” and it hurt my heart.
TLDR: My crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and I’m 16 and she’s 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here, but I don’t know if I am the butthole or entitled one this story.
This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.
I sent a direct message to the artist I wanted, but nothing for 2 months.
Like yeah, I understand they are booked for summer tattoos, but at least say “Hey I am booked for the rest of ____”.
But I was like “ok, well I am going to look at another artist’s work from this shop that does small tattoos.”
Same thing happens: no answer.
So me and my brother decide “ok, let’s go to the shop and ask, then we will at least get a answer”.
We go, and this young girl attends to us.
Let’s call her Brenda.
I told her everything.
Brenda said “well you can do the tattoo with me”.
I said “I’ll be back.
I’ll think about it”.
I got back in the car and scrolled through her work.
It was good work, so I went back and told her “yeah let’s do this”.
I signed everything.
She didn’t even ask for ID, which I found weird, because I had gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on.
I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.
She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.
I was like “ok, great, thanks!”
4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.
The right side of the heart was smaller then the other side, and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again.
So I reset it, and yeah oops, I was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn’t dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry, and like through text she kind of sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if she’s mad, and like she said she’s only a bit let down.
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me, and like I apologized to her and she said its alright.
Then I just told her I’m going to sleep, and she just left my message on delivered and, like, she didn’t reply until today.
How to tell whether she’s mad at me or just annoyed, because right now I’m really confused?
Would I be the asshole if I was just a bigger sarcastic asshole to another asshole?
Her tumors are beginning to open through her skin, she won’t jump, painkillers don’t help, she ate a lot yesterday but won’t eat or drink today, she hid most the day, but... it’s hard, because she’s alert.
It feels wrong, because she looks at me like “I love you.
I’m happy you’re here with me.”
But the vet said she wasn’t even supposed to live this long, and the tumors will only get worse, and even if we had done chemotherapy, it would have only prolonged it.
My friend told my girlfriend something.
She then broke up with me.
I don’t know what to do now, because she and the ex-friend were the only people that I had.
What should I do to try and regain my relationship, because she’s helped me through a lot over our 2 years of dating?
TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me because of something someone said, and I want to regain my relationship with my girlfriend.
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee, because she’s a person of color with tattoos and “fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up, because I need to protect my staff, but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex loves kids.
She was playing Captain Save a Hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman’s situation with this girl’s “crazy” baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in each other’s life.
It hasn’t even been two months!
I’m so hurt.
She never wanted to build a life with me.
I knew she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, as soon as he saw that I was weeping, answered, “Come with me.”
Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.
Entering, he led me with him on the bounds of a great circle itself encircling a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land covered with lava pyramids, with sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life save for those imprisoned in it, who, though they surrounded us, dared not approach for fear of the master.
As my ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, cries, and explosions that made the eternal air tremble, caused by slaughter, starvation, withering, and frief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, of men, women, and children.
They’ve grown out to the point they look kind of awkward, and she’s saying I should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something I’d like better?
Aah!
She said she might have some clothes that fit me.
I’m dying!
She’s so supportive and nice, oh my God!
So, it’s 0:34 the first of January while posting this, and my sister (F14) just ruined my New Year by calling my mum fat and telling her she’s a drinker when she poured herself a glass of champagne, which she only does on her birthday on Christmas Eve and on New year.
Now my parents are pissed off, my grandparents are pissed off, and my sister thinks she was funny.
The same thing happened on Christmas Eve, and now the whole feeling of New Year is gone and I hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sorry for my spelling.
Screw INTJ’s. Why have they got to be good at everything?
It was a mistake getting the booster the day before New Year’s.
I feel like absolute dog water.
Literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and I almost cried 🙏 I’m so happy, bro.
She’s so cool.
I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :-)
Also, happy New Year’s Eve and happy New Year everyone!
First of all, the satisfaction I get from saying I am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
A high I’ll never come off of.
Second of all, a customer comes in for the second time, mad because I didn’t do copies from a book because of copyright.
She goes “well, I called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
And I’m like ??, ma’am it’s in our policy.
I don’t care what customer service says.
She keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy”.
Like, lol, not when you act rude like that.
Our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and she’s such a cuddly, loving, little girl and I love her cuddles every night and in the morning.
I’m just scared that she isn’t going to be like that after she gets fixed.
Am I overthinking it?
Do you think since she’s in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she’ll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I don’t fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently she’s been asking me if I’ll fart in front of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and it’s weird she’s never heard me do it.
I can’t believe she saying I’m depressed looking while she’s such a shy girl and weird thinking she’s not.
So delusional.
I hate it, but they are my only friends.
She’s calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to D2 after several year, now I’m wondering: Where do you guys sell or buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or is there a website that’s more efficient?
My friends are mean and delusional.
One is immature and shy and always pulling me down.
The other is fine, just jealous, and it’s getting on my nerves.
What to do?
This is a setup I can live with.
My boyfriend’s and my fear however is that in a few years when we’re ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own boyfriend.
I’m very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow any more pushing of the boundaries.
What do I do here?
Boundary Issues with my boyfriend’s alter.
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was up-front when we met and said she’s shit at texting, and has apologised when we were speaking for slow replies, something to which I said “don’t worry, I know you’re busy!”
The conversation seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation.
However, I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread), but she’s viewed my story and posted a story since.
It was New Year’s Eve.
So I was all ready for the New Year actually thinking positive and the changes I’m going to make, etc.
Then I see he’s posted a picture of them both that she’s taken saying “love of my life”.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face!
Ex’s boyfriend posted a picture of them :-(
Every time I ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even though she’s older, what the fuck?) and that I shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her.
She drains the life out of me.
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently I’ve been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, I could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brought herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to separate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later, we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great.
I’m so happy.
In our anniversary month, what do I see on his phone Snapchat?
I look at it again, I see Jane, but this time I can look at their conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So I just got my first bearded dragon.
He’s only a month old, and like most new owners, I’m worried about if he or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day, but so far I’ve only been able to feed him about 6-7 crickets.
I’ve tried feeding him some vegetables too, but the guy doesn’t show any interest in them.
Is there anything I’m doing wrong or is he just fine and I’m overly worried?
Then I found out about this really cool website called Complex.
They’re sort of like journalism but better, since they’re all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through Complex.
Before, I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic, but Travis Scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
Now I like Tame Impala, and I’ve started dressing weirder, I bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully I’ll wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromises himself/herself on social media?
Is it just me cringing at the Twitter posts by Albatross?
Everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
He’s making it seem like XVG is a sinking ship at the moment, and it’s doing fine.
So I have this friend in real life.
Man, the dude is known everywhere.
He’s got a solid reputation on the streets, in the jails.
Everywhere this guy goes, everyone knows him.
He was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on Reddit, because I feel like I’m not really known.
How do you get hella karma?
I’m 21, he’s about to be 23.
My issue is that he seems to have no ambition anymore.
He doesn’t work and doesn’t make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an EMT.
He failed it the first time by 2 points, and I think he fears failure so he doesn’t really want to try anything anymore.
He’s been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
I’ve gotten Super Smough about 5 times, but I always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear I’m far enough away, but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
I’m using a 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helms and naked (even with tattered armor it doesn’t seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know by throwing myself at them enough times I’ll get them, but it’s slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do, but I seem to always get caught in a dumb combination or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or notice the letter I put in there, and now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you you read this sentence wrong too?
Well, now that I have your attention!
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :-)
19/F Aw shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time.
If I just want to make Draven my 1 carry, how should I do it?
I know he’s a good unit, but what items can turn him into a god?
I tried healing sword and rapid fire cannon, but I get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character.
However, his shield’s gun is overpowered and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets that’s fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate, because it got absorbed.
I don’t know about other players’ opinions, but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so he’s not overpowered enough to counter everything.
Tell me what you people think.
I didn’t think anything of it, so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him, the entitled kid started screaming “Mommy, he stole my cookies!”
At first I was startled.
I started to get nervous, and I froze.
Then entitled parent walks up and starts yelling “Give those cookies back to my daughter!
Give them back!”
And I did not know what to say at first, but then something came to mind: just say “but I didn’t.”
But the way I said it was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That’s when my dad noticed (he’s old — sad he didn’t realise a little bit earlier) He called a manager to the scene, and the manager told us to continue and he’ll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We’re both xxx majors (I’m a dual xxx and yyy major while she’s a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn’t say I’m smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I’m a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (she will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
It’s not until my next billing cycle that I noticed something was off.
I was a bit lower than normal and I keep a very close eye on my expenses.
I looked over my bank statements and there it was: My new Prime bill.
I was super confused and got hold of Amazon’s customer support.
They helped me as much as they could, but because I was receiving my service through the phone company, I would have to go though them and figure out the problem.
The next day that I had off, I walked in and talked to a very sweet girl, who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kind of talked in circles for a bit as I tried to explain what the Amazon customer service told me.
We looked me up in their system and there I was: 2 lines, but no Prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date I opened my first line and then the second.
Both dates added up to what I had told her before.
She stared at the computer screen for a while with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tomorrow I’m no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach out all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered, it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance, and he messaged me on Friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said I didn’t change anything.
After that part of the conversation ended, I asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
He said that he’s good when he doesn’t think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him, etc.
Day 1 of no contact starts tomorrow.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster.
We used my name and I’ll credit his Instagram below.
He’s a good guy.
I’m glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and our story.
Would you guys like either homemade lore or not?
I couldn’t post this on the Fallout Reddit for some reason.
It wouldn’t let me put the photo.
I hope it’s good, guys!
Is it even possible for ITSOKTOCRY to blow up outside of the 3 songs he’s had do extremely well? Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for a while, and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much I despise griefers, because they don’t just destroy something in a game, they destroy hours of work, and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying I’m mean if I don’t go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non-stop how I’m “mean” or a “bad person”, because I’m busy doing something so I can’t go give him his shit.
Well, I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I don’t see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy.
We do get slightly tipsy, you know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a Facebook message saying he’s ready for her to leave (she’d been there 2 hours at this point) and then he starts passive-aggressive cleaning in front of us.
He’s going through a divorce so he keeps telling me that’s taking all his money.
I didn’t give him a title as I didn’t even get one when I bought it.
It was salvaged from some guys at a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale, but I’ve long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do you think it’s not worth it?
Also, if I did want to how, would I?
So I just told this guy in my class, who was also weird as fuck and gave it to him saying “oof, I sat on it.
It broke.
Do you just want it?”
He’s like “no, ew”.
I have OCD and immediately got ashamed and was like “lol, why’s it gross?
It’s the same as a whole one (and along that line), like, lol, why?”, and he was like “ok, oof, it’s not” and I’m like “lol, why did you say that?”
I was saying it jokingly, but I’m afraid I looked weird.
Like what the fuck?
Why’s she upset or playfully upset that I don’t want it.
My human staff comes home tasting of sausages and cheese.
I think she has another fluff she is making treats for.
Should I be sad or angry?
What does your human taste of when they come home?
I can tell where your human has been and what they do by taste when they come back?
Anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday I finally mustered up the courage to message him.
Me: Hey, how’s everything?
Him: It’s been a long time.
Me: Sorry about last year.
I was super awkward around you, lol.
Him: lol, no, don’t worry about it.
*drum roll please*
Me: To be honest, I liked you blah blah blah…
Him: Haha, you could’ve just told me!
Next time you see me just say hi.
Do you still go to <school>?
I’m not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn’t sit well with me.
Hey guys, I just wanted to share this helpful application with you all :-D.
It’s not that I am trying to promote this application or something.
It really helped me a lot.
That’s why I thought it might even help you guys out.
I’ve seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team OVRs, and many are thinking to buy players, but can’t decide which will boost their team OVRs the most.
This application helps to calculate the OVR of your team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people (F2P players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team OVR since it will result in a huge loss of coins (because of 10% EA tax).
What’s the recommended amount of dedicated RAM I should have to server?
If you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.
You should be asleep.
Go to bed, I say.
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Star Butterfly.
She had blond hair, blue eyes and a super cute and colorful dress.
And she had a magic wand!
One day she got kicked out of Mewny (her home dimension) by her mean mom >:-( just because she made a mistake.
So she had to go to Earth.
On Earth, there was a boy named Marco Diaz.
He liked safety and he was super handsome.
Everybody at school was in love with him!
(Except for that idiot Jackie)
So anyway, Star came to the principal’s office.
He was like “Star, this is Marco.
He’s your guide.”
Star looked at Marco and she was shocked.
“Wow, you’re so hot.”
“lol, thank you” he said, blushing, and he winked.
“Let me show you around the school.”
“Ok”, said Star.
So they walked around school and they became friends.
“Ok, since you’re my best friend now, I should probably tell you who I am”, said Star.
“I’m a magic princess”.
Then she took out her wand and created 667 laser puppies!
I have a question for this Reddit.
Can you provide honest answers?
I currently have a custom build PC with i7 3770k 32g@1666 RAM and single GTX 1080 GPU.
Should I get a second one for 650 euros or wait for what upcoming years will bring?
GTX 1080 SLI or save money for 11th generation Nvidia xx80 TI GPU?
I know a lot about Jailbreak.
Should I make a Jailbreak?
How many likes can a thoughtless post get as long as I like Telecaster? :l.
If you don’t upvote post you hate Telecasters and should die.
Thanks, ok.
I love Telecasters.
We should rename August to October, because he wasn’t released in August.
I’m out, boys :-)
I bought GTA4 for Steam PC and it won’t work.
It worked fine for a small year on Windows 7, and now my PC has Windows 10 and it won’t work.
I made Social Club and Games for Windows Live accounts, but it won’t work even with accounts.
It won’t work even for single player.
It won’t work after the people on screen wait in the loading screen.
Then suddenly when the game should start, it just closes the window and that’s it.
So how make it work ?
How do we get them to know they should use it?
The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse...
I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty.
I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens.
I want to own freedom...
How do we change the landscape?
What are your thoughts?
Sorry for my English being bad.
I should buy up that limited time bike for Halloween before it disappears next week.
Inside your body, deep beneath your skin, muscles, and not beneath your organs, lurks 1 (one) skeleton.
Spooky!
But wait, it gets worse.
The skeleton inside you doesn’t even pay rent!
He/she lives in your body so he/she should pay rent!
They freeload off you and don’t even do shit for you.
So you should evict your spooky boy.
Happy Halloween!
Edit: I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it has!
Thanks for the 6 upvotes!
Just small information, I’m 5’9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k, but I really can’t hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical “you should be good, but you’re not, so I’m going to give you unrealistic goals”, or should I be at 1:49?
My head hurts when I go krumping heads with other boys!
Green lighting things go all over the place too!
What should I do, doctors?!
Right, so I’ve fixed my headaches!
I’ve had to throw up some burny green stuff!
The boss says I should do that more on the battle, the place we’ve been fighting in!
I’ve got a metal stick for my trouble too!
This poem went as follows: > My name is frog, > I like to play, > Out in the rain, > All night and day.
> My skin is green, > My face is coy, > You look and say, > Here comes that boy.
This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Aren’t you all tired of seeing at least the first two jumping into battle and wiping out your whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying that if they weren’t here then, well, the game would be balanced.
Well, I beg to differ, because there’s Akai with his insane disruption and Diggie with his timely ult or maybe even Irithel might be banned because of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly, the king and queen of this game are Lancelot and his beloved Fanny.
You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is.
She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo.
You be a good girl!”
She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak.
Haha!
Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what?
Haha!
She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl!
You left the steak alone!”
And that is the story of me being a good girl.
Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt.
She says she is dumb not to think of that.
Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers.
Now I obviously can’t get out and shut it on the main road, so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I’ve quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothing’s happened.
My bed smells like disease.
I should probably wash it.
Please send me some tips and stuff on what to teach him.
Currently he’s doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns, because that’s the only gun he gets kills from.
I already taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
By the way, this is coming from an Iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say I should be silver and some even say platinum, because I carried a gold player).
Do you know how some motherfuckers exist?
They literally get close to you, then all of a sudden you have problems, and even though you apologize again and again and again, no it’s never enough for them.
I was in a Google Meet, but I told them I’d be back in 10.
I forgot my phone so I went to get it, and guess what, them speaking about you and backstabbing you.
You seriously don’t know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
Maybe I am overthinking, but I’d rather die alone than live among these kind of people.
Maybe I should just ignore them?
Or should I give them another chance?
Or maybe I am just weird, lol.
l have developed feelings for my best friend.
Now, the question is: should l tell her how l feel about her?
Will this affect our relationship that we have?
How will she take it?
I’ve been waiting for two years now, savings from then and I barely made 200 USD until now.
I’m still studying, and gaming is my dream… and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness from life… to be honest…
What should I get?
A monitor or a GPU…?
Some of you are so lucky to get a GPU for free on here… lol…
Am I the asshole?
Me (31F) asked my kids dad (43M) to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in the kids’ room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not meant to lift too much or stretch but felt OK and thought I could do it alone.
I can’t.
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of the walls where I can’t reach.
He said yes and today came to do it.
After a bit, he said he was done and leaving.
I gave him £20 and said how grateful I am for the help.
I checked the room once he left...
Both kids’ beds were full of torn off wallpaper, drawers cracked where he stood on them.
I’ve still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent the last 45 minutes picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds.
Am I the asshole if I confront him about the mess or should I let it go and not bother asking in future?
My boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when I ask dumb questions (for example, I didn’t know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard?
Just fill it”.
So I tried to do it but I failed.
Later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?”
Then when I do it myself and don’t ask him he goes “why don’t you ask me?
I can teach you or help you”, but I refrain from asking, because he gets frustrated.
The last couple of calls had arguments, as he got mad, because I beat his ass in video games (even though gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked about him to lots of my real life friends, and they all ask why I continue to be his friend, and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only people who actively tries to interact with him online.
Yeah I know, my shoes don’t match.
They match the graffiti though!
I’m trying a lot of different styles, so let me know what I should change.
Hat: Sicko by Ian Conner
Shoes: Nike Everything else is thrifted.
Ok, so I swallowed a small piece of box (?) tape as I was trying to bite it off with my teeth, and then I feel it in my ear 😭 not ear but that hole in my throat that leads to the ear.
It’s just stuck there, oh my God 😭😭😭 What should I do, lol?
I don’t remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida, there’s a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100 times longer than when it’s not making a sound.
I’d describe it as that trademark desert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff, and … it’s just dude what…?
Heck, it’s weird.
So maybe it’s both a sort of a paradox (life is), but I just want to know, honestly, did anyone else feel it?
I want a logical explanation please, and if one doesn’t exist, well I mean, because long before…
I was “of age” so to speak… for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate, because I don’t drink, but I’ve…hmm…
I’m an adult, let’s put it like that.
There’s other stuff out there, but long before that, me and my family saw a UFO.
Even my stepdad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been, and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall and, like… it doesn’t really scare me, because I think it’s the way life is.
Things change.
They don’t always have to make sense, and others say that too.
Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling: > The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.
And so the North Wind was obliged to confer that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm autumn moon.
Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you yet again, creating chaos.
Who would win?
Please give a detailed explanation.
Ares (Greek mythology) vs. Mars (Roman mythology) vs. Svetovid (Slavic mythology) vs. Odin (Norse mythology) vs. The Big Bang (Atheistic mythology).
I am very ready.
I am very good.
I would like to apply for village idiot.
Should I get Horizon Zero Dawn or ELEX, because they are the same price right now, so what should I buy?
I’m just looking for reason.
By the way, I like open world a lot and shooters, e.g. Skyrim, Battlefield, COD, Ark Survival Evolved.
So any ideas on what I should be?
By the way, I would prefer them really quick.
Thanks in advance.
Thanks for the suggestions guys.
We are going to try to get the AK-477, because someone said it would help, but where do we find it?!
Please help with it.
We can’t do it alone :-)
I reside in Hyderabad, India, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in computer science.
I am a Canadian citizen, but for enrolment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam.
Now, the doubt that has arisen is… would my admission be considered international or domestic?
On a side note, how hard is it to be admitted to UoT’s computer science program?
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
I would prefer a hardcore clan with a plan.
With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal or target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It’s not a necessity, but it would be nice.
PM me if you’re interested!
By the way, it’s my first post on this subreddit, so I might not have gotten it all down correct.
Locusts, grasshoppers, etc. can shut the hell up.
I’ve literally heard people tell me they learnt then forgot the entire Japanese language through anime.
I live in a house with a single mother whose first language is Thai and I barely heard English until I was like 4.
She would speak in Thai to me yet I don’t know any Thai.
You can’t learn Japanese though anime.
In fact I watched anime in Thai dubbed as a child.
I don’t fucking know shit.
Fools thinking they are out here saying “konnichiwa” in style, I’m contacting the authorities.
Here’s a question for you.
So you know the Panzer, Blue Gitz, the Tau or whatever?
So I, being a Mek, notice that they’ve got tanks and stuff that are flying, right, but they’ve not go the flames coming from whatever thrusters keep them in the air.
And they don’t make the beautiful roar that thrusters make.
I figure some commando would want a flying truck that doesn’t make a noise.
It’s a good market strategy.
Anyway, the question: “how do I krump gravity without a sound?”
Construction: teleport to house, for when they work on making player-owned houses useful, this would be godly to have.
Heck!
Even now, player-owned houses has a permanent dummy for adrenaline building, prayer altar, and if they make it like Old School RuneScape, where you can teleport outside any player-owned house portal, this cape would be used a lot.
Hitpoints: Heal from regeneration ability increased, current perk I doubt would be used at either bossing or slayer.
This one is used at slayer at least.
I got one of my annual minds.com token ads in my mail today (I of course unsubscribed as soon as I found the option) and thought “hey, what the heck, let’s make a visit on the supposedly “alternative Facebook” that I just recently got denied for having a “non-believable name” and waiting further ID specification before I can use it again.”
And so I did and found out on the 2nd or 3rd post that The AJ Show has been blocked on YouTube, I’m not a fan of rightwing stuff and was actually the reason I stopped watching it 2 years ago, though the small fragrance of freedom was that hard to find among the 90% national-capitalism the site has to offer, but anyhow, I got the idea of a non-censoring video site like LiveLeak but much more simple and less “newsy” that anyone can post on.
No content would be removed ❤️
Hi guys.
I’m at 1500 hours right now, and my instructor still doesn’t let me solo.
I think I’m doing my manoeuvres ok, but the instructor says I still need more practice.
I’ve tried my manoeuvres on a flight simulator, and my friend captain says that I should stop sending him videos of me playing GTA on my computer at 1 in the morning, although I trained hard on my flight manoeuvres.
What should I do?
I’m literally crying and shaking right now.
My friend would never do that :-(
Why don’t they make like Sesame Street for the kids, yo?
Like, it is very educational, I think kids would learn a lot from it.
I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras.
I have some questions and hope someone can help answer.
1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc.
Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about?
2. Is there enough parking for the second car?
3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to?
4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ?
It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place...
I appreciate any advice I get.
Bones says something like “switchblade on my waist don’t test”, and it was old young teenage bones, and the beat was hella mellow.
I would really appreciate this.
Finally it’s giving me an internet connection, but the only problem is, it’s so slow.
It’s capable of loading like Google, but anything else just times out.
And for some reason I can’t access my router admin page.
Really weird.
It’s just a white screen or it times out loading it, or the page becomes unresponsive!
Help would be appreciated, thank you!
Hey all, so today I was in the group chat with friends, and like four of them were roasting the fuck out of me, and at first it was funny, then my ego and self-respect got crippled after building it up for a couple days.
Haha, fun.
Yes, I know I am lonely and won’t get a girlfriend, but you don’t need to be jerk like that, haha.
I’ve searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
They could even go woah eee ahh ahh/oh eee ahh.
The possibilities are endless and I know it’s hard.
I’m just wondering if anyone knows it, thanks!
Hi there, it’s good to see you again!
*sits down*
How have you been?
*cuts a potato with my sacrificial dagger*
Wow, that’s great to hear.
*adds 12kg of salt*
Hm, there we go.
*throws a handful over my left shoulder for the devil*
Ok good, let’s eat.
*removes a small flask from my jacket and pours blood from it onto my plate in a small thick puddle*
Haha, that’s the good stuff right there.
*chomp chomp
*
Do you want some?
No?
Ok good *eats a spoonful of salt*
Oh!
This is crunchy.
*chews and spits out bones*
Huh *licks lips*
Welp, that was wonderful, I’m pooped.
*gets up*
Thanks for having me over!
*transforms into a bat and flies away*
I’m feeling sad, but it’s okay I guess.
Because medicines will help help us all.
Thank you, have a good morning and good night and good evening Truman show, haha.
Just kidding.
It’s going to be just as shitty if not worse than last year.
All these skin mods and such, how’s it being done?
I’d like to try it.
Is it player-side only?
Mods?
How are people modding Battlefront 2 or is it Photoshop?
Hi, I was wondering whether or not it is worth dropping some money on pets.
Like, I saw how much some people can spend on them to get good results (like T4), and I wouldn’t want to spend that much :-D.
Currently, I have 5 T1 pets, and I wouldn’t mind seeing some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping “just” $100 would be worth it.
Is it worth dropping $100 on pets?
Towards the end of senior year and that summer, I don’t know what happened, but I got a hot body and my face was all “girl, you’ve been through some shit.
Have a gift”, so now I’m pretty.
I just made a post on a different subreddit about having a nice date today, which is nice, but I am very hesitant on making friends and stuff because of the last two years.
So like, after my glow up or whatever, more people started talking to me, yeah.
And a lot of boys did too!
I never really had very many friends, so this was a huge yay!
The first boy I hung out with was really nice, but then we got high and I did very regrettable things I do not like.
Well, that boy was super happy and told lots of boys.
I don’t want to jinx it and call them out by name, but I’m talking with a company and I’m hoping it works out!
I’m excited about all things I’ll be able to do with these free promo products to help other people and possibly get them off some or all of their Rx drugs!
I’m excited for myself, because I have a bunch of medical issues that I do not use Rx drugs for and the other stuff I buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others, and it will help this company as well.
I’m ready, I’m ready!
I’m hella excited! I might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do: my plant’s now way too small for its age in my opinion and has started to grow pistils.
Should I chop and restart or…?
I will be posting more here once I get… comfortable again.
(Self-love is important!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through - will get to them when I can :-)
In the meantime, Happy New Year!
P.S. I don’t have a Snapchat and don’t take any money, I just like to show off, you know, closet slut things :-)
lol
Talk to you later, everyone!
He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.
I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No.
You’re fucked up now.
What’s going on?”
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says “good lord, what the fuck happened?
I’ve got to garden.
Talk to you later”.
He read my reply, which said “I’m so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it, and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated”.
I just don’t know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him, and he will always be my first, and I’ll always talk to him and care for him, but I don’t want to be held in limbo.
I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know whenever I say “talk to you later” or “good night” or whatever I want to add an “I love you”.
Just casually.
To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day, just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten-fold.
I know sometimes I daydream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
It makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
To be honest, I kind of hope it is, because I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof, is it hitting me hard!
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I (I will takes days or a week to respond), but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to at the moment.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick “talk to you later” either to be honest.
Finally they seem to want to engage with me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then on the day.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on, and it’s not like we’re really talking, so I just block them.
I don’t know, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival.
I’m still “Ocean Serene”, but maybe I’m...
I don’t know, that’s a tough thing to say, I never thought that my girlfriend was just a random.
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said a lot of things, I’m gonna agree that if I change, the world changes.
The advice you get, it’s always iffy.
I want to speak for everyone, but at the same time I can only speak for myself.
Also, I went to get some rum and coke.
I got coke and a few other people saw it, so they bought some coke…
erm, I hope my friends are ok (that’s all you weirdos I’m talking about).
Random story I know.
To be honest, I’m not ok, but I’m surviving like usual.
Actually I’m all just a bit right and fine.
Talk to you later.
Talk to you later.
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, it’s 8 hours to [redacted], 7 to [redacted].
Not a big deal.
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles, an hour’s drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol [me] I suppose [redacted] or [redacted]’s wife ratted me out.
Maybe I should block them too.
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house, and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you, and we can see how well that went.
[me] Shit.
Betrayal.
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self-gratification.
I was in a toxic relationship for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our relationship, we were great.
One day, both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
I’m going to admit that sometimes when I feel jealous, I just want her to reassure me like how I reassure her that it’s all good, but she will only reassure me once and then said “bye” or “talk to you later”.
Most of the time in an argument, it’s always my fault.
She won’t admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight won’t continue anymore.
And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”
And he said “Yeah, well I’ve got to go.
I’m doing something”, and I was going to type “alright, talk to you later”, but I realized we aren’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe.
When the conversation started.
But once he said he’s doing something, my heart dropped.
Like, what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him, but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doens’t like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now, I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he wants to do that.
If he doesn’t want to talk to me, he can just fucking tell me.
I don’t know what else to put besides that I hate the current circumstance of life I live in.
I’m going to give a little insight tomorrow.
Ok, I lied.
I have to reveal my age tomorrow, because if I don’t, it’ll mess up the story.
Um, I don’t know what to type so I’ll type a worry I have.
Um, I don’t think I’ll get the tape gun in time.
Ok bye, talk to you later everyone.
She said something like “but I want to make sure that we go as a friend?” thing and I was like “okay, I know”, and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said “of course I like my long time boyfriend”.
Yeah, whatever, right, haha.
And here’s my question...
Yesterday when I was at work, she messaged me saying something like “how’s your work doing?”, and I kind of replied to her with a cold tone saying “I’m at work, talk to you later”, and
then she, kind of upset: “Okay, I mean I understand you are at work so busy, but you didn’t cut me off like this before; so I kind of get it that you don’t want to talk anymore like before.
Got it!
Bye!”
How do you get destiny delicacies?
I’ve seen a few people have them, but I’ve never got one.
I don’t know where you get them.
If anyone knows, it would be a lot of help :-)
And my machine fucking freezes up.
It’s been happening for like 2 days now...
This machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3D scanner, but 4 browser tabs on Reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% of my damn memory and 60% of my CPU power and freezes the whole damn thing up.
Hey!
Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint!
Seriously, what the fuck are you developers doing?
Stop, please!
If you think it’s rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying “got to go, I’ll talk to you later”, then it’s also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one-off.
Things happen.
Maybe something came up and you got distracted, etc.
But every single person ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It’s really not that hard to just say “got to go, I’ll text you later” or “so-and-so just got home, talk to you later”.
Even just “bye” or “be right back” or something!
Today I got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if I did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn’t want to ignore them just to talk to me.
I said it wouldn’t be a problem if he had just said something like “I can’t talk right now” or “I’m with my friends, talk to you later” or just literally anything.
He then said I was overthinking stuff and I should “chill out”, so I left it at that.
So am I the asshole and overthinking things
?
Am I the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend after he ignored me for a few days?
So I would usually post this on r/keto, but that subreddit is so intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But, like, a girl’s got to rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
I have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere, I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, calories please”.
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their “no cheat days” mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten-free dairy-free carbohydrate dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
As far I as I know, the concept of mini-album is only around in K-pop (maybe I-pop?).
I’m always disappointed when a long-awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5-song album.
I can tolerate a debut album, since you really don’t have a lot of material, but if you’re SNSD or something and you come out with mini after a years long hiatus like Mr.Mr, it’s kind of insulting.
I don’t know what to say, lol.
I’m pretty funny, not only because I manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often, but also because I’m just fucking hilarious to be honest.
I’m from Yorkshire, and that probably makes me cooler than you, because the North is just superior, and I’m ready to die on this hill, but I guess we can be mates.
I would really like some of those.
Ok, I’m running out of people to laugh at my jokes.
17M from the UK, Please be able to hold a conversation, lol.
I don’t know what kind of dog this was, but it was so ugly.
My god, who would own such a thing?
Dogs with wrinkles like Pugs, Shar Peis (I don’t know how to spell it), Bulldogs, Boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all; I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally been told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness and over the nose, they can’t breathe)
And yes, I know I’m going to get shit on by all the fucking neckbeards on Reddit that just adore their snot nose little Pug.
I don’t even care.
I’m so tired of people and their dogs.
Every time I listen to him, shit makes so much sense, even though I don’t know what he is talking about.
That leads me to believe that either that guy is a genius who can articulate what’s going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something.
I mean what should I listen to if I really want to find out the truth, if Schiff is just “biased toward gold”, and that’s the reason why he is so hard on the current economy, etc.
Are boobs nice?
Because, I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before.
Then he checks the oil level, saying that the oil also smells like gasoline, that gasoline and oil are mixing up together.
He opens one spark plug, sees the massive leak in there literally full up.
Let me say, oil smells like gasoline.
I didn’t smell that one.
That’s what the worker told me.
Then he call his boss, and the boss says it is not gasoline, it is just oil, “that shit smells like gasoline” 🤦🏾‍♂️ Even the worker confirmed that I’m not crazy, but ay, maybe I am.
And his worker told me he was going to seal the black thing that goes on top of the spark plug that covers it.
Sorry, my English is not that amazing.
He said he was putting a seal after draining the oil as he mentioned.
As oil drained, the oil sealed the thing so oil doesn’t drip out of it and doesn’t drip to the floor.
But it didn’t help me find the cause of why oil is getting into the spark plug, because a seal on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️ He tells me if the problem keeps on, it is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way too much oil and is causing the oil leak, that if the problems persist I will have to remove it.
Sorry for the long paragraph, but I need advice.
I need help to be honest.
My rabbit didn’t eat or drink, so I went to check him.
It’s been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food, I don’t know.
(He has constipation so I’m going to check if he poops.)
How do I sleep if I have to check on my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is going to become chaotic, lol.
I assume the time has already passed for this, but, I don’t know, I figured I may as well ask.
I kind of forgot I even had those tickets until they announced they’d be touring again today.
Now, my aunts (grandma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated grandma both before and after she passed.
When my grandma first started getting sick, my sister wasn’t the best, because she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but grandma was also scared of Covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job I couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back and forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
Would I be the asshole if I didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So I met this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dating.
Last night, everything was all right, she was happy said “good night” and “I love you” like every night.
And the next morning when I texted her good morning, she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad as fuck all day because of me but didn’t want to say why.
I don’t know what I did.
I did nothing.
What should I do?
How can I contact her?
Should I give her space?
My girlfriend blocked me, and I don’t know why.
Mine’s ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in which I have an F.
This is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I’ve done but are nowhere in the books,
This kind of snuck up on me, because I thought they were done and filed, only to check my grades and find out they weren’t.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you are going to say “I know right, I only have an 89, why couldn’t she round up?
Fuck my life)
I’m going to be honest, that’s not very helpful right now.
So first off, Bard top.
What a pick, I know right?
Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like.
*my core is static/ie/RFC.
Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way.
I like to safely clear and lay out poke.
Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer.
Giving some more tank…
Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain.
I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade.
This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great.
If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy.
I’m tet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years, we’re both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It’s driving me crazy, how to deal with it?
This wouldn’t be an issue if all your servers asked at the beginning “do you guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.”
Also, why restaurants have to be set up like that?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Hey guys, Bard main.
I just joined Reddit after finding out there are other off-meta Bards!
So I main him top.
Yes, it’s scary, but I do.
So I’ve been getting a lot of questions about my builds from friends and happy on-lookers lately!
I thought I’d share my builds!
I’m 16 years old, 5’9.
I’m new to basketball and I’d like to ask for drills I can do by myself so I can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I don’t have a decent shot nor a decent handle, I could barely reach the backboard plus I have no friends so don’t even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why I wanted to be good at it so bad is because I just want people to know me as somebody, because right now I’m a nobody, I want to be somebody.
P.S. I’ve never played an actual basketball ever in my life…
I know, right?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising, you know) but pretty chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when I want to be), goofy, a little chaotic, big overthinker kind of deal.
Enneagram type 4, because apparently that matters (just kidding!).
I’m honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love... you get the gist :-)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist, so a program with medical school prerequisites would be preferable.
Plus, I plan to take my medical school abroad (wow, big dreams much?
I doubt I’d get in, but it wouldn’t hurt to try though).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me.
I’d be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh, and location too.
I’m short, so if my classes are far, I might as well rollerskate my way through campus, just kidding.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, you know...
Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would’ve prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do.
The player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now, but I don’t know if I want to pursue her.
It’s complicated.
Right now its summer break, so I’m going to wait until school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person, because they don’t talk to me online, lol.
I don’t know how long this series will go, but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I don’t know how long this is going to take but probably quite a while.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I don’t have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say that if you’re a kid, like an elementary school kid and you’re here, where the fuck are your parents? lol, never mind, fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Because I got them and no one to give them too, lmao, just kidding, unless...
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium Sprite and a McDouble?
So I don’t know why I got on everyone’s nerves about the separate checks…
Hey, hi!
Haha...
I’m new here, I didn’t know this existed until now.
I am extremely shy and don’t know what I’m doing here typing this, haha.
But hey, first time for everything right?
If we don’t click and you lose interest, then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry, lmao.
I don’t expect to get any messages, but hey, it’s worth a try.
P.S.
I don’t know how to write these properly, so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format, oh my.
Oh and if I don’t reply soon, it might mean I’m asleep or playing DnD, hehe.
Never mind.
My internet is down right now.
Fuck.
Well I’m going to see if I can buy some stuff off Steam now... Let’s hope there are still some good sales.
Okay, so I was a total noob and erased my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was going to use, but I sent Monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
Or how do you open the .key file?
Edit: never mind, I’m a complete noob.
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive Monero wallet seeds with a .keyfile?
user765123: No, I just had the “is now playing” thing show up.
A:
I know.
A:
Well, here we go.
A: “easily disturbed”, lol
A:
Momma, help me.
A:
Help me.
A:
What’s the canon name?
user765123: ?
A: my name.
A:
What’s the canon one?
user765123:
There is none, pick whatever name you want.
A:
Oh.
A:
Am I a girl?
user765123: Male.
A:
Argh.
<talking about their name here> user765123
:
That seems like a good name.
user765123:
lol A: >:-)
user765123:
(not that it really matters.
I just used my real life name)
Comment So I can guess your gender based on your post history.
Never mind… let me guess your gender instead.
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the professor is October 18.
(Edit: never mind, this part isn’t true, please disregard).
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is February 9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the professor that I’m dropping the course?
Do I also have to get permission?
I’m planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits by the way.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I really wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what?!” really loudly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “never mind”, because I felt like I was in the motherfucking spotlight.
But every time, my narcissistic mom says that it can’t be true, because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
“It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?”
Um, I don’t know, maybe it’s because we’re different people with different bodies?
To be honest, has anyone ever experienced fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn’t die and manage to kill a least one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch, but rampage didn’t pop his ult yet.
😲 What the fuck?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky as fuck fighter, and a carry that solos everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also.
I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in...
Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
Like now I feel guilty for smiling.
Never mind the fake ones shit, but fuck.
Haha.
Ugh.
Why am I still alive?
lol, why the fuck does smiling hurt?
Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me.
I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible.
He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever.
I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions.
And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had.
I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting.
But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedely keep eating my food.
I do that for maybe 3 seconds.
Then I look back up.
Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds.
Edit: Yes, I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen.
Useful, I know.
But ugh.
They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
By the way, there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit

:
never mind.
I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance.
Oops, now I’m not getting any MP!
Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!”
The message repeats every time I hit enter.
What the fuck!
I’m not cheating.
Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player.
10/10 I’m never playing again.
Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens.
I’m going to skip the Oscar-bait shit like The Post, because there’s only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Democrats making movies about how (extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) “politics used to be more polite.
We need a return to the discourse.”
I’m sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas, but I’m just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns at the moment, but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior offensive line I think is a major problem, but there is no Nelson-like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there, that’s really the only situation where I absolutely stay put.
2 months ago, I bought a cheap ’95 Nissan truck.
I was only locally driving, so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn’t put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm.
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd only when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can’t rev it past 3k in my driveway without feeling like I’m going to break something, I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it.
It’ll hit close to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule out what could be causing this power-sap, i.e. is it the air or fuel or a clogged cat or exhaust, etc. or something entirely different?
I ruled out “different”, I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone else’s narcissistic mom treat you like you’re overreacting about your period pains?
Hey!
I read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangerous.
Is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2-month Boston Terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.
My friends think she said that because she was with her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up, etc.
Others think it’s a way for her to be evil, like think of me, because I’m never coming to get that charm.
I think it’s some type of hoover, good or bad.
Any insight is appreciated.
If you’re a woman, please tell me your perspective.
So confused, but she is clearly with someone else, and why couldn’t she call me back and why didn’t she respond to my text messages?
She could’ve said “I’m with my boyfriend, please don’t call me”, but she didn’t.
Just a side note: my boyfriend and I are buying a house.
We will be moving out in 2 months.
Once the papers are all finalized.
I have an Australian Shepherd, 9 months.
My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) got her at 3 months.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with, a black Labrador and a small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a Rat Terrier.
Their play style is boxing.
And one of my room mates (25M) has a Beagle.
He doesn’t like to play much.
In fact, he seems kind of scared too.
I know all of these things about my dog.
I know that it doesn’t matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise, doesn’t matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business.
What matters is that my dog is nervous.
So when I hold my hand out and tell you, “no, he’s not sitting or lying down because he’s calmly waiting for you to say hi, it’s because he’s nervous and insecure”, I don’t mean it as a joke, and it’s not an invitation for you to say, “aw, well my dog/child is very friendly, so let me approach!”
I don’t care if your dog/child is friendly or “dog savvy”.
I don’t care if your dog “is just a puppy”.
(why the hell is that even relevant?
Is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies?).
I don’t care if your child is capable of not screeching “oh my God, a puppy”.
Can you, you know, do something about your child? And also your dog?
But with less than 3 months to go for that, I feel I’m not ready yet, but having never taken it, I have nothing to compare it to besides colleagues’ advice.
Without knowing what I know, they can’t know if I’m actually ready yet, but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this bad and it would be awesome to be done 6 months from my introductory exam.
I’m close...
I just don’t know if I’m 2 months study close.
Some certified advice.
(M/5’10”/26/165-195lbs) 2 months progress, am I gaining too much weight?
I passed my FAA PPL written!
I know this sounds weird, but here’s my issue.
About 4 months ago, I had an 3700X which died after start, crashing when I tried to play games, and a day later not booting.
I sent to RMA, they confirmed the CPU was dead and gave my money back after 2 months.
After that I got an 3800X.
As soon as I tried, I got the boot code 7b, everything powered up but no reboots or video signal.
I sent to RMA this time with the store.
After 1 month they confirmed the CPU was faulty and sent me a new one.
I got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom (T) has always been the type where her feelings matter first and only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone else’s fault entirely.
For example: I needed someone to babysit our then 2-month-old for 3-4 hours.
Dad’s work had someone who had Covid.
We opted out of them watching our son and asked my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her before I set it all up, because I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its my fault and she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her days after the incident, because she didn’t call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing, T promptly got off the phone.
I never got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to T’s narcissism.
I don’t expect an apology from T, because she never has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5 months, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2 months, he’s co

slept with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I’ve been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get a 2-month baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (currently replacing pacifier every hour).
First time mother to a sweet 2-month-old girl, and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
First time mother struggling with sleeps.
So I already have an orange golden chinchilla (Toto, 2 months old) and we have had Toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got Terri (2-month Himalayan Ragdoll) to keep each other company.
It’s only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor.
Just always going “brr rrr rrr”.
I’m not sure if she has a blocked nose, because Toto never made this kind of sound...
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
I can’t play until tomorrow but would like to know, so I can make money hunting or robbing everything and everyone.
How much do pelts sell for online?
Alright everyone, I think I mis-tagged this earlier, so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily with a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, and lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running (I have no issue with being over 12 feet from other people - I usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then I have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually I’m quietly confident going into these games but with injuries, players missing etc., I’m kind of happy if we get a draw.
I know they’re utter piss and paper-wise, we should be wiping the floor with them, but I’m just not feeling the 2/3-nil vibe at the moment!
Anyone want to talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
This is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait never mind, shit meme.
I was 6 and playing Lego Rock Band, I decided to ask for the Buddy Holly pack.
My parents (despite being in their 40’s) said “how the shit do you know that?”
I never realised that my parents got into Weezer.
So that’s how I got into Weezer.
I genuinely don’t understand how “toxic” behavior is more punished than literally int or troll.
Well, I’ve had an account which always received those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until I got in a bad streak of losses in ranked, and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior....
And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in-game chat for toxic behavior after a report doesn’t understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait until the morning, but then I said “never mind, I just realized it’s almost 2.
I’ll just wait”.
And then he asked what would happen if I ate it right now and I said nothing.
It’s just too late.
Now he’s telling me to just say “fuck it” and just eat the cereal.
So inspiring, but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :-(
Before I realized it was 2.
Help, lol, oh wait, I can just Google it.
Never mind, lol
How to delete a subreddit.
I know your skin isn’t perfect or you’re insecure about your nose or looks.
But those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You’re beautiful, because you’re you.
Rant over.
Actually, never mind.
God, why did you give me this huge ass nose?
I’m too ugly to even rant on Snapchat, so I do it on Reddit instead.
Ok, it’s over now.
Hopefully.
Can I get an RIP in the chat boys?
I was trying to go to sleep, because I couldn’t, when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked, but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says, because she only said my name in all caps and then a “never mind”.
Fuck.
I just realized I’m complaining over a 5-minute fix…
I had never heard of this “influencer” before and consider myself pretty internet savvy.
I then lost interest in her, because her Instagram wasn’t that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread, and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out, and then I took a great interest in checking in on her, because I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while: How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her lots of money, because she claims to not be able to afford food or rent or whatever, when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers, which aren’t cheap.
I don’t like him or anything, but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my boyfriend with him.
I wouldn’t do that to him of course, but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
Me: I’m highkey liking boys more right now.
lol, this is no culture.
I’m still trying to fucking finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.
And it’s my actual birthday tomorrow, lol.
This is not meant as a rant.
It’s only just informing Oro mains that they look noobs whenever they play Oro.
Never mind, I guess this is a rant.
Never mind, it’s back up.
That’s like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying “ah, never mind, I want to eat somewhere else” as soon as they’re bringing the food out.
I played a game as Rengar and I was 6/2 and got solo killed by Anvia who didn’t have Rod of Ages or Tear finished yet.
I looked over at the replay 100 times and all I can think to my self is, if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did, the Anivia will win CNA.
Someone please explain why the fuck an Anivia is strong than a Rengar in a 1v1 when the Rengar has a gold lead?
Actually, never mind.
I don’t care.
I’m just quitting this brain dead game.
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage and both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds and says “never mind”, so I just gave her mine and went on with my day.
I’m so sick of hearing the same beats of Mexican music, ahh!
Edit:
I lied: the party started at 8 am and the music stopped just now at 7:30 pm.
God, if I have to go through this every weekend, I’ll just kill myself.
Edit 2:
lol, 10 minutes later, never mind, the music started again.
What the fuck!
Edit 3:
It started raining, so the party ended haha!
People go in the dark alone.
No one could be that stupid!
If there’s a ghost in the house, why the hell would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a little too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they’re screwed.
4. The fuck are you splitting up for?!
There’s always this one guy in horror movies that’s like: “Guys, there’s a crazy ass killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed”!
That’s exactly what the killer wants!
Basically, I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again because my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her), and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this Reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh never mind, he’s good” and “P90 is broken.
I’m quitting the game”.
lol, never mind, I’m still here.
I can’t sleep.
lmao, it’s just me, never mind.
Just what the title says.
Do you pick up insects and spiders with your bare hands?
I’m deathly afraid of insects and spiders, so I don’t know what to do.
I want to kill them before they get away.
Play a scuffed 24-hour WOW livestream filled with condescending undertones, belittling, and shitty half-assed ill-prepared gameplay.
Throw begging, depression and sob stories on top of it and call it couples stream.
An Altarian virus, anything is possible.
In fact, that day on Onias Three, you were infected with the cell of its hosts ten days ago.
You have been in a coma, delirious.
Your fever broke this morning.
I don’t have one, because I’m 17 and haven’t gotten around to it (and no, I’m not driving, because I’m terrified) and that I haven’t gotten my gender marker changed, so no updated documents at all.
I have a passport from a while ago from before transitioning, so that doesn’t have an updated name either.
So I have no idea what to do, because I’m going to an event with them on the 14th.
If it helps, my dad’s a flight attendant (has been for like ever).
Should I cancel?
There is always next year, but, like, I’m lonely in real life, because my boyfriend is an hour away, and as much as I love my other real life buddies, I’d like a breath of fresh air :-(
I don’t know if I will.
If I do, I will be in my mid 30’s, because I want to live life my way.
But I need to have sex to have kids and that isn’t going to happen (because honestly “me too”).
I have to go camping for a scuba certification.
There is a grill and they will eat burgers.
But I am on a vegetarian diet.
(I eat some animal products but much less than I did before.
I eat 80% vegetarian)
I got pretty close with an equalizer with a little low end and high end shaved off, going into a soft clipper.
The equalizer before it makes it Slam.
I was going to try distortion and a limiter after, when I get off work.
(The limiter was highly suggested in the last post, so hopefully that’ll do the trick)
I’m just looking for advice!
What should I do from here? Someone please let me know.
You can easily get an infinite powerlock in longer fights.
I have a 4/40 Dr Octopus, and I see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and SPS, so not bad in damage either (like vision).
A very viable option for AW attack.
and also arenas, as you don’t have to bait out in those small fights, because you never let them reach SP3 before you finish it.
Get ready boys.
Pogo will not open for me.
It keeps saying this device is blah blah blah… you guys know what I’m talking about.
Anyway, to fix this, I am on Android 6.0 before the security update and I have root with Magisk 16.0.
Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise, what with having a storyline that doesn’t come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and necessary amount of seriousness and comedy.
The characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert, Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events don’t always have to rely on Neptune’s presence.
Great bait, mate.
I relate, straight appreciate, and congratulate.
I rate this bait an 8/8.
Please no hate, I’m straight irate.
Create more, Can’t wait.
We should conversate.
I won’t berate.
My number is 8888888,
I’ve taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take no more.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: Meh, ok, that’s fine.
They then use shit like A subtract 1 through A subtract 20 for variables.
In fact, I have a linear algebra book that did this... A’s for everything.
The pages were just matrices filled with A’s.
Just draw a weird shape or something - anything but that shit!
Scariest thing ever mate.
Well, well, here we are again, frustrated, angry in front of my phone.
What a neat way to start isn’t it?
All of you readers are my therapy and I don’t owe you a cent.
Perfect, right?
If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all because of your short attention span, so let’s keep it short (what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying “keep it short - I’m a genius aren’t I?”)
Well I tried explaining to my buddies that porn is kind of shabby, and yeah just bad, and you know who listened…
Hey, I just want to know what games I can run on this PC and which not.
I was a spy, and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told the jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, Mafia and Serial Killer had made their kills.
I proudly said: “I was attacked while in jail!”
Wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and asks me “You were attacked while you were in jail?” and I answer “yes mate”.
He then tells me that what I am saying is bullshit, because Serial Killer and Mafia have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously?!
Like, I don’t really care what mean, shit people on the internet say.
But when I got nobody in real life, all I have is the internet, and it does kind of hurt a bit when I just want to vent my problems.
And I’d be fine if it got maybe a single upvote and no comments, and I’d be fine.
But instead, it’s full of people saying
Oh boy, you are too dumb for the movie, boy.
The director was like “shit, it’s about the hidden meanings you have to find, boy, like you know it doesn’t spoon-feed you the film, you know?”
Like shit, why does it have to explain, mate.
Just imagine what happened, you know?
It’s not like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has, you know?
Yet when fully charged for the first 30-60 minutes, it’s always on!
Which is beautiful!
Lastly, if I do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping), the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off.
What the fuck, mate?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone, or is it just me?
In searching Google, I cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues, I am really enjoying the mod.
It’s just a fucking ball ache every single time I want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before I can puff...
Every time I log on, I want to chill away from keyword NMZ, and play Xbox and be fat, right, but lately I log on, play RS away from keyword for like 20 seconds and I get logged out, and it’s fucking annoying.
Is it my internet connection or is it the servers or what?
It’s pissing me off, mate.
Next we have my statistics class, and I didn’t realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework; and so my grade was a 70 something, and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my band class is basically easy A as it’s show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert, and so I passed that.
Good game, easy, mate.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do not go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like “what the fuck, mate?” and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after, I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there.
Did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This year’s rookie game is actually going to be real exciting. What line-ups do you want to see?
I love this show, but sadly I’m near to finishing it already.
What is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story?
I never watch movies or… so sorry about my lack of vocabulary on this though, is this called dystopian?
Well I’m really lost, but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy!
Has it happened to anyone else?
It happened to me a number of times.
So if you’re on leg 2, you have to win 10 consecutive games for the XP and coins, 10 stamina for 40 tickets.
Get the fuck out of here, EA!
Her: Oh, where’s this ice luge, haha?
Me: Probably my friend’s hotel room or wherever he can find a place for it.
Me:
I came to <insert city> with my fraternity and a sorority – that’s why he’s getting it.
Her: Gotcha!
Her: What fraternity and sorority I’m in xxx.
Me: yyy.
sorority is zzz.
Me: You’re interesting though.
I want to hang out with you.
When this week?
Her: Uh, maybe Friday?
Me: Ah, yes.
Me: Friday.
*one day later*
Me: <girl’s name>, we’re hanging out tomorrow, right?
I don’t like when people type huge paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me about their problems.
I don’t like when people mumble on the phone or if they ramble on, and it’s all about them.
But now it just doesn’t make sense.
You only get 1 ticket per match, and if you are lucky, you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the one thing free-to-play was always able to do because of the low cost of entrance and the rewards were good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you don’t like him, use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you don’t like the new WT, then don’t play it.
Closed tech support?
It’s, 1:30am and you’re a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
What the literal fuck?
Was your heating bill too much this month so you can’t make your rent?
You mismanaged bunch of fools.
So, long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall ’22 semester, and I’m on the waitlist since April.
Housing isn’t guaranteed when you’re not a freshman, and my income isn’t enough for rent so… There’s a possibility, I might be homeless.
My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No fucking competition.
Most men this day are thirsty as fuck.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half-assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains, they grab and grunt at everything with two legs.
And I mean that literally.
But – that’s good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24M), an accountant at a traveling company.
We ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today I called one of our agents and a girl picked up.
She was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts, and she said “yes, I will be at your company at 21:00”.
I said “ok, and at 21:00, she came by and asked who is the accountant”.
I said “I am, please follow me to the room”.
She came and I asked her how much did she bring.
She said “I have $1300 with me”, which will not cover all of their debts by the way, so I brought a receipt and wrote down the amount and the company name and then I asked her for her name.
She smiled and looked at me and said my name.
So none of my friends are answering me 😭😭 So, it’s time to make some new ones!
I’m in the mood to call, so let me know if you’re down!
Looking to talk to people around my age.
I’ve posted before so you can check out my profile for more info.
I’m a little lazy right now 🥴
Anyways, let me know what your favorite type of music is 🙃
I had been wearing Lane Bryants Lounge Bras the past four-ish years, and so this was the first time in a very long time that I wore a bra with wire.
So come Monday, I wore my new bra with wire that fit perfectly at the store, but after a few hours it felt so uncomfortable!
I am worried I wasted my money… :-(
I’m so miserable and seriously just want to cancel my trip but don’t want to disappoint my husband.
He’s been looking forward to a vacation for so long.
I’m dreading the plane ride so bad!
Luckily the flare is a bit higher and not right where I make contact when sitting, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.
I’m going to be walking around in 40 degree weather with a big angry boil on my ass.
God help me 😫
Hey, there.
I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of “you” or “your”, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
Just type out the word.
It isn’t hard.
Hi guys, I was drinking with my friends from the US and my boyfriend and everyone’s fallen asleep, and I want to play some truth or dare or drink, so if you have Discord or Kik, just message me, owo
So I just had my baby with the man of my dreams 4 months ago :-) and it felt like I was living my fairytale life.
I was in my exact vision I had, but then, long story short, postpartum with new emotions had me pull a crazy move and I checked his phone about a month ago now, only to find out he was meeting up with a chick, doing favors for her, spending time in her room and texting a lot, all while I was pregnant.
Now he and her both say they are just friends and never hooked up (yes, I contacted her number), lol, but I don’t want to lose my man, though I also saw he has dating profiles and he says he doesn’t do it all the time.
And he won’t do it anymore.
I don’t want my baby’s parents to split, plus I love him and want our vision to carry on.
But how?
Please help.
Can I?
Or should I trust him again ?
Day 17 of posting Corgi stuff (sorry for not posting for so long)
I have insomnia and I can’t sleep at night, and it’s just like I have so many ideas at night that just so many ideas keeping my up at night.
Please tell me how sometimes I can get better sleep.
Because of that, I almost failed school and because of skipped lessons, and people tell me to listen, but just, like, I talk with somebody, and then I just think of something.
I forgot what I was about to say, and I had a math tutor, but iI couldn’t focus and just also my mind is like chaos people.
Tell me.
Oh, I don’t want to take medication and I’m sensitive to medicine.
Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that.
She probably already has one also.
A real digital movie camera costs so damn much.
So I opted for an analog one.
Now, 8mm/Super 8 have an affordable price, 16mm doesn’t cost much, and 35mm costs a lot, so I think I’m going for a Super 8.
But then how does it work?
lol, I mean, I buy her a Super 8, but I should also buy her a video recorder, and some VHS… things like that.
I don’t know how it works.
Please can someone explain to me what should I do.
How do you guys do it?
It’s so scary, but I want to last forever with him, and I know I can’t tell the future, but we’ve been through so much together.
How do you guys keep it going through all the obstacles life throws at you... how?
Do you want to run some Minecraft? XD
I’m bored and my friends are busy or out right now, so...
I finished the game for the first time today.
What a wonderful and amazing game.
It hits right in the feels and fucks your mind up at times.
My ending was sad.
Kara and Alice die (I am bad at controls), North dies, Hank dies, Marcus is successful, but I let Connor kill him, because I guess I was doing kind of a role-play where Connor is the villain and the outcome is realistic.
I will try to open other openings.
But yes, the game was so good.
Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!
Maybe a little earlier, I don’t know, because I’m usually at work, but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mb/s range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more people are at home I’m going to see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60…
I am an aspiring doctor/medical student, and so seeing a lot of medicine-related subjects as early in our first semester I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!
I passed for UPLB BS Biology!
To be honest though, this wasn’t my priority program, so of course I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be a scholar, but I was also worried, because I’m not really as interested in Biology as invested I already was in Physical Therapy.
Sure, I could learn to love Biology, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year, but that’s not certain.
I will play with anyone on 2K21.
I’m an 87 over 3 level scorer.
As one that will play with anyone, REP and OVR don’t matter.
I have no one to play with most of the time, and no randoms want to play with me.
Please play with me.
I promise I won’t sell.
I can shoot.
I have an 81 three, but I can shoot.
I’m a shooting guard.
I need someone who knows how to land planes on PC to help me.
That’s all.
I just need you to land the plane.
I know how to do the rest of the mission, but the plane has been messing me up for hours.
Please help as soon as possible.
My discord is SingSong254.
Contact me there, then I’ll give you my Ubisoft account information.
Thanks.
Help, I need someone who knows how to fly planes well on PC to join me.
Let’s fucking go!
What’s up guys?
I drop around 30 kills a game right now, and I’m trying to get out of low ranks and get into Platinum.
If you’re good at the game but simply don’t have a Stack, add me on Discord and we can rank up together.
Just to clarify, when I say “anything” I mean anything within the FM’s current power.
So no answers like “remove the nukes” or “boot the royals”.
We cannot do that (not yet at least…).
You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.
What do you do?
Me and my real life friends need a team that we (or especially I) can VOD review in order to learn about tarping, switching layers and positioning.
I was thinking Wolf/Soldier/Wilkinson but I’m not sure if there are any better ones.
Preferably EU as we are EU, and some stuff happening is basically exclusive to EU, lol, but I guess it could be NAE as well.
Thank you!
Looking for someone to play with right now.
No toxics and no obnoxious people.
I don’t fuck with that.
18+ NAE.
I just play for fun.
You can be bad.
I don’t care about skills 😇
One word I simply can’t say properly is water...
It actually hurts my brain trying to add the T, and I sound American if I do or still say wut-ta.
I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to say, to be honest.
I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when you meet people who drop H’s and have glottal stops.
I’m curious how likely it is that a post on my personal space will be shown to people. Please write “+” in the comment if you see this.
So I got a Sky Q Mini Box for upstairs.
It doesn’t work.
I have to wait until late March for an engineer. lol
So I will be starting a job next week and desperately need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
Looking for single bedroom flats or flat-shares is a legitimate issue as three letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
Vacuum won’t stop sucking.
Please send help.
Is it going to blow?
Basically, if you didn’t know what that is, it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Let’s eat granny” making it seem like someone’s going to eat their nan.
However, the other example says “Lets eat, granny”, implying a different meaning to the sentence.
A pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas, I guess.
I literally couldn’t have been more at fault I just drove straight into this woman’s Golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it).
She seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it’s my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers as well, just very minor body work and paint, maybe a small dent.
What broadband do I get?
I’ve had Virgin for 8 years, and holy shit, is it slow for £40 monthly.
Is it the old router or do I just switch to a cheaper BT or whatever?
Jeans, T-shirt, steel-cap boots, boiler suit (lol), high vis, gloves, goggles, dust mask, ear protection.
Help.
I’m melting…
Edit: the heat has got to my spelling ability first.
The end is nigh.
I’m sure as eggs is eggs that I’m not the only one that goes to the gas pump, and I want say £10, 9 times out of 10 it will go £10.01.
Bloody things are rigged like a slot machine, I swear, lol.
lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn’t actually laugh to.
LOL - adults and people who don’t really know how the internet works use this
Lol - I’m not sure why this came up, but it’s likely an autocorrect, but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named.
LoL - Grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
It’s also confusing because of League of Legends.
loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with “spool”, but I think it’s the drawn-out “o”.
So yeah, I think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn’t exist.
lolll - when I hear her say “loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it.
but I still think that’s “loool”,
You can’t repeatedly pronounce a consonant.
So, when is Big Ben going to bong again?
Hm, mandatory title.
But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Preferably under £50!
Also, does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming (that don’t require me to stand for lengths of time).
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what I do, I literally can’t keep the dust at bay for more than 24 hours, and I am losing my mind.
It’s 10pm, 28°C, and my bum is literally melting.
Saturday session three and chat.
If this bear isn’t named Beary McBearface, we have failed as a society.
It’s 32°C here inside my flat.
I have taken the t-shirt off and soaked it in cold water.
I’m wearing it.
What genius ways are you keeping cool whilst working from home or somewhere extremely hot with no AC?
Bloody lovely fucking weather, isn’t it?
16 hours in Wetherspoons.
Okay, so I went out with my girlfriend to go to 7-11 and I had my hair in my face, a hoodie, and a mask, and someone called me he/him.
Bruh, I’m so happy right now, what the fuck (I’m non-binary and use all pronouns, but nobody has ever used he/him for me and it feels really good)
To the neighbor that went out of their way just to check on me, I appreciate that.
I just wanted to say from one Gen Z to Millennials, good on you guys.
I hope you find what you’re looking for.
It’s been fun being your little buddies in life.
If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet, everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really, to be honest.
Remember, there’s a lot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that doesn’t experience a lot of positive moments, this subreddit does make me smile :-)
Damn, some people need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet, Jesus!
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kind of a lot, lol), so I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I don’t see the need, because who the fuck cares?
But now it seems that you’re all making grits without the butter and making us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were preparing to tour more plantations than Carter’s got little pills but you done gone and brought up them “slave owners” now.
It isn’t amounting to anything more than a hill of beans!
If I had my druthers, I’d have just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt something decent about history.
All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
You get along now, do you hear?
How to go from number to date?
How do I break off a relationship with my “friend”?
Basically, I put my skate account in my Instagram biography, because I have no posts on my main, and I’m kind of insecure about my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless, and people won’t expect me to be like shredded or some shit if they add me), and today I got 3 followers (girls from different towns who don’t know me).
I’m really picky though, because I don’t want to have a relationship, unless I actually feel like I’d really like the person and be into them a lot, so I didn’t follow any of them back.
Bro, I’ve been added and un-added on Instagram so many times today that it’s kind of a confidence boost, lmao.
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from people who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers, smh… I have nothing else to say, come at me angry people, lmao.
Hi guys, I’m a casual just-for-fun gamer, playing 5-6 games a week.
Yesterday it was just pure horror division 10…
I could not win 1 game out of 6…
Like, is everyone smurfing ? Or what’s going on?
I know people want to play the objective.
I get that, but why do you need to shush or watch full replay or every cut scene?
So basically, for my A-levels I got 82 RP and wanted to go the NUS business administration but didn’t get in, though I’m quite sure my grade is good enough, and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago…
*welp
* :-(
I got into SMU business administration, but I still feel damn shit that I didn’t get into NUS, so help change my mind and convince me why SMU is better than NUS, especially for business :-/
I’m most scared that in the future when I’m working, people will look down on SMU like elitism discrimination all that, I don’t know, man.
Or will they pay less or not even hire me?
RIP, because SMU is kind of 2nd best and less well known.
I would really appreciate if you all could help me out, especially those who are currently at university or have already left.
Thanks pals :-)
TLDR: the title.
Other vegans that you’re friends with tell you that they don’t tell other people that they’re vegan.
Like, they purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community, because they are probably the people that would be more gentle with their words, which is what some people need in order to listen.
I’m a very straightforward, no sugarcoating type of person, and although some people appreciate it, a lot more get upset and start trying to put words in my mouth and twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like €300 worth of fake internet points, like, what the fuck are you doing, honestly? lol
Why would you give awards to people? lol
I just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre-googling and confirmed the time that I’ll be there.
If she gives any further resistance, I think I’ll just next her, ignore her, not respond to her, agree with her that she can’t handle the place, or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first freaking date.
Yes, I agree things like Tumblr made-up identities are weird, and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted, calling people snowflakes is just weak.
Give yourself a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without any unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series!
Props to you!
The New Year’s Eve Raticate with a hat.
I haven’t found him anywhere yet.
Does anyone want to raid?
I need a few people quick.
Stop.
I think what I am trying to say… this game is not hard.
Don’t make it hard yourself.
The main objective, as I understood, is to get the dragon, and don’t die before that.
Even better if you outfarm your opponent.
Just don’t die.
And trades in lane… if you see the enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights, but he was out of town.
So we couldn’t do that, and now he’s back in town, and I asked him what he’s doing on New Year’s Eve and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers from our work.
And like, he didn’t offer an invite, and then he said if he cancels with them, would I like to come over, and I just said I don’t know what I’m doing yet, so I don’t know.
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There are going to be people on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid.
Hey, the regulars!
I just wanted to say that I love the group channel, it’s amazing, and love your own channels as well.
I love all your videos, and I have a suggestion for a video for the channel: Do a Minecraft build battle and whoever loses there, the other people get to write something on their Twitter, lol.
I hope you like my idea and can use it for a video.
I have a group chat.
It’s on Discord for people who are bored or want to chat about anything.
We already have some people who chat and stuff about anything.
It’s chill, edgy, and if you want to join, comment and I’ll direct message you the link.
I just kind of realized that I’ve never had New Year’s Eve plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that…
I recently realized that I still don’t have enough friends to have one for my 21st coming up…
I don’t know why I didn’t clue into this though.
Like, I never thought about how people have traditions for this night, besides my sister, who goes out to her friends’ every year.
It’s funny that Covid isn’t affecting my New Year at all…
Is anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway, I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight, lol.
Hello, I’m looking for people to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
Just please be aware that I’m not very good at upholding conversations.
uwu F/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the Word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the “aaa” word, and I want to yank four words without selecting the spaces after “ddd”: > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like, I see videos on YouTube on it.
But like, I can’t see any mention on the design notes, etc. Where do people get the information from?
DM me to debate.
Please be well learned in your belief.
I want DMs, because it’ll get deep and I can’t reply to 300 people like that.
Also, I need 500 characters so here come the blah blahs.
I’m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I’m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl, but I am saying that they won’t like to do it, because they are humans with their own choices, and not agreeing to be a girl isn’t making them a women anti.
Like, how many guys around you would be willing to be turned into Disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time but how much time?
And maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
But knowing this isn’t making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they are asked to do all this.
I wouldn’t like it if you tried to make me a man and wanted me to dance in front of so many people, even though I am a tomboy.
Is anyone missing me?
If you miss a Reddit friend, read this.
It could be me!
So I just hopped on PC from PS4, not even 2.5k games played there.
I played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a keyboard and mouse, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with people 2000 kills and predators even.
Yet I haven’t even a hundred games played and about 80 kills with all characters.
I’m not really having fun anymore.
I can’t improve if I get shit on every game.
I see a lot of people on here who seem hella sad, so if you’re really sad, I’m up for a chat.
So yeah if you are up for a chat, or long-term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so.
So I always see people talk about sending designs and edits to Affinity, but how do I do that?
I’ve worked at OD for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it.
Like not even the print suppliers.
We do every type of editing in store and I hate it.
Like we’re out here doing stuff that I’m pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to Affinity based on what I see on here.
But yeah, is more of this information on the store portal or where can I learn more?
I’m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last-minute, rude customers :-)
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k, and I was like “Hell no, that’s not worth 100k”, like bruh.
Why do people find the new set expensive?
I know the girl I posted about is a troll people, but oh well, she’s got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down.
It is the bar with the team composition and the status of each character that is used to follow “report team” (like in the actual World Cup).
It can be tweaked down to not reveal too much information about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier, and you won’t have to use tab.
Hit me up with a chat message.
Tell me about yourself and we can go from there.
I don’t understand how people can build what they do...
I love building but I guess my creativity isn’t well tuned as a lot of people’s is, and it bothers me that I can’t build amazing stuff.
I know I could if had the creative side, ugh!
I just tend to give up after a while and settle for simple crap to pass for ok.
I care about how I affect people a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in conversations with big groups of people, which is related to ADHD.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kind of stand-offish to people I don’t know.
I’ll try to act like I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me but drunk people will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all are ADHD things though, because of rejection sensitive dysphoria.
I’m a good listener.
A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent.
I can have a really, really, really flirty personality at times.
I remember in high school, my friend’s mom said I had the “personality”, so I’d probably be the first to have a boyfriend.
But when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds her accountable, she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects anyone/everyone who doesn’t agree with her and screams about how she doesn’t care.
Or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck”.
She’ll never take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite.
All the things she screams at people to not do to her, she turns around and does the exact same rude, petty shit to anyone/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her.
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts just like my mom, and my mom can’t stand it/accept that So she becomes downright nasty.
In class, I’ve usually been really quiet, but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click with in class and be really, really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen B, feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk though.
I’ve always been a smiley, happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have ADHD.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really, really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk - I heard people with ADHD are both.
Could I be ISTP?
Help type me please.
I don’t know if people would even want to.
I just want to know if that’s allowed, and if not, where would be a good place to post that.
(I’ve watched Dragonmar and other people’s videos but that would be hard to be a me-specific video on there)
Like in a good way though.
Some people are just indescribable.
I haven’t done this before, but I’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like…interests :-)
We can definitely talk about anime (especially romance - I’m a sucker for it), we can talk about games and go into detail about lore and stuff, creepy stories go hard, and really I’m just down for anything :-)
I’m not gonna be weird so long as you’re not weird.
Any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah… if I didn’t do this right let me know :-)
Oh and I’ll absolutely talk more on Snap.
The part I’m humming is like “word word word wo-o-o-ord” twice.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like “fly-y-y-yyy.”
I’m pretty sure it’s a popular song; I’ve heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah, to be honest it is.
I care about a lot of people and I can’t just... make people be happy.
But like… I want to :-(
I just want to make everybody I care about happy.
Like, is that too much to ask?
I think that some people here are AI or something.
smh, don’t even try.
I can do that by myself 🤠
Hey, F/19, bored as fuck.
I enjoy talking to new people.
Hit me up!
I started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90’s.
She said everyone was watching wrestling back then, and it was a cool thing.
Now no one gives a shit 😭 (I don’t really blame them sometimes).
I asked her “why do you think people stopped liking it”, and she said “because it’s garbage.
It’s come on Fox on Fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hits, I change the channel”.
I had to include that in there, because she’s so funny 😂😂😂
Anyways…
Hey, I can’t fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting.
Hit me up if you think we could hit it off well.
I hope we have a great time, future chat buddy ;-) 😁
It’s kind of weird, I’m not going to lie.
These motherfuckers can outrun, outswim or outstam (through venom) anything that tries to get them.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
I just finished the show so I’m a little behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much, lol.
Also by sidestory I mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
My favorite Obama quote: "Michael and I also wanna uh, acknowledge, uh.....yy...y.yy..uuuhhh..yyy....your son Jack, who deployed today."
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc
Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best game ever that I play!
But have some probs..
I’d always heard of mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple months ago and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists rn.
Anyways that was just my thoughts,
Happy new years everyone
hope the new year treats u well.
Now for this one it's kinda hard because the enemies are SOOO COOL for this game, but... If I had to choose, I'd say I like the Clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not THE only enemie in the game that doesn't have a single other Variation from what I remember.
Honestly I wasn't gonna make one but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I dsagree with a lot of others list,
not to say my list is right bc this is all subjective anyway which Is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
YAYYYY
Imo lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind ive only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of ep 3)
unlike her father lily tries to work with lee and for the most part the group
she does what she has to
she is a bit of a bitch cause she has to
i only have 1 problem with lily
she killed carly
if you could get ben to confess
yes i got spoiled on that and a few other things
ben is useless
he is what looks like a collage student yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7
pls dont downvote me into oblivion if i missed something
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats
so 4 isn't really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kinda sucks IMO.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who lived both as a woman and as a man
(not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
so thats kinda neat imo
I don't think he did the role justice.
I feel before neo figured it out the way he was speaking was ok, but after...IMO he should of went full Hugo weaving speech.
Just wanted to share my opinion not being a united fan, on the game against burnley.
(not that many of you will care).
Mctominay sheeeeesh what a guy.
Thought that shaw was solid,
now youve got two good left backs in good form.
Also wanted to say awb had a muhc better game i thought.
AFter the shitty games and dalot playing well I personaly thought awb improved alot.
Hahaha.
OMG it's terribl-....yyy funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can ONLY drop at 4-6,
yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues but for me I can live with those issues but not this,
pls change
Kind of an odd question imo, but I have a bp who I just got to eat f/t for the first time (yay!!!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I've tried f/t large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
Could be a fluke though.
Ik it's like a meme or something of "dark souls player complains about the combat" or something similar, but I just don't get the combat.
I can do ds3 deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately,
ik not a difficult game but hear me out rq if you know the game.
OMG!
WHY do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they dont have ANY idea of how a torrent even works (its so damn easy though!)
comments like "The link doesnt work" Rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
Your just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So i get tipped on the app, gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the app after?
Wtf is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was LESS than the app tip...
If your are tipping both, TIP BOTH.
Ngl tft is a good mode ,but its like hs a good game to play on your phone not something to grind out all day all night like wtf ?
Its not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on prep up and alt tab until its next time u can do anyhing)
any thoughts?
i know its a scientific things and all but some of the post there is just too much.
learning dream languages???
wtf?
and some bloke is saying "i tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didnt lucid dream?!" every few hours.
maybe the post are just giving a litte too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like Dear lord wtf is happening ooooh
So I am I first time cup user and i got the saalt cup at target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold+17yovirgin=ow)
I got in in w/the 7 fold and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how tf am i supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails.
In one way, it kind of helped me ~find~ the cup lowkey grip but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping
I'm down to my last dollars soon and I can't just eat beer and cigarettes
then I set them down so I didn't have to carry them across the street to get beer (it's cheaper at Adventures First Stop)
then I walked back and forgot my groceries
walked all the way home and ah shit, I'm getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill
I live on a hill. down. the middle, really.
i imagine it's like an amateur San Fran
so I walked back and got them.
no crime round these parts.
not much, anyway.
Didn’t think about nails...
Is he gonna tell her?
If so how would that convo go down?!!!?
Okay wtf Arlo now knows sera ( idk how to spell her full name) is Johns weakness
First of all, we've seen they are greedy as f(OK, not as other mobile studios, but stiiiiiill)
Second, game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high end phones)
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
Wtf are you yanks on
See also:

> zomg thats rly cold
im never moving to canada
Someines it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me tf out and gives me nods similar to codiene,
why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with wether or not a woman looks at me and thinks Im ugly,
if that happens I get anxious From it,
but ifva women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks im decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
WTF IS GOING ON
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisble, even if they don't detect you they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I shouldve just grabbed an smg and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many trys most of them being on his second phase,
his 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7 place on last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Becuz i have less than 3000 points.
(i need 55 magaki frags and i get 50, just feel my suffering)
Also in other event with gamer764 i have \~8000 points and got 4 place and got rewards for 4 place, not for 1,
whats need 7k points or more.
Are the developers too greedy?
Hope the title makes sense -
Have a list of names "john.baker" (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 colums "john" and "baker"
Thanks!!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were goin to see each other and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday and so I canceled it and now she won't stop saying sorry that's not what she meant.
Wtf do I do
I told her I was going on another one next month(lie) to make her feel better but I didn't.
But, I don't neccesarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks
Okay so I've got less than a chapter left in GotM and I still can't understand wtf Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I'm missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots
Yhall are whack
Wtf i posted a litteral anime foot and still didn't even make most controversial post of DAY. let alone all time
So huh you cant alpha karthus ult
wtf is this bs?
It would be very helpful all of you OP's out there actually said wtf it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it!
Such as "now I understand why this (brand name) thing has everyone going crazy"...
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn't mean much to me.
If it's too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever that the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the "DFW teams are cursed" camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me to much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential WTF transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a pc but in the mean time I use a crappy 13 year old pc
I got money for rust bought it and it took 4 hours to download 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server

However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind if disrespectful to the new bf huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd,
however, i will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her but i cant think of a reason why i should…
After going "uhh no?" She sends me a picture of said candle holder.From her kitchen.
I of course go "wtf you're home??" and turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So Im beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
Tldr: sickly nmom went into hospital for 3 days,
I find out shes home because of a candle holder.
ts been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but its really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is i let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message i sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful bc of a song i made that i was sharing.
I was very flirtatious maybe more so than i was with my gf when i was first talking to her and that has been choing in my gfs mind.
Its been extremely difficult for her
we have two dogs now
i was hoping us having two pups to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again bc we have them to bond over but she still cant say "i love you too"
she doesnt accept when i try to give her compliments bc ive said rude things in the past when i use to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you but i dont see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trumming my nails, wearing versace crystal noir and ither fragrances etc. Which i believe is the reason why most girls even if theyre taken at least are willing to have a convo with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self development and even though ive been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, i never let it get me down and im so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women even though i may not have hollywood good looks or charidma like will smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and i wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :)
Shes 18 inches long & weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
Just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champ every 4-5 days and shes already longer than some males get so I'm curious!
the anime is about an mc thats in a game but she doesnt realise it but the system says shes dead and etc
i would like to wath the rest of it soo plz help me.
Lookking for a anime
Idk if to others its strange, but to me it was.
I got covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so i had to tell my mum.
I couldve just lied and say it was cuz of sharing cups or kissing a girl since in BI, but i knew my parents would be accepting...
so i told them as it was.
My mum was VERY dissapointed because she thought she new me well, and though i told her everything but now she couldnt trust me anymore cuz bla bla bla...
basically he was very dissapointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that i didnt feel like telling her because its private to me... till today
she doesnt really trust me like before, but shes ok lol.
Today its my birthday so im sharing my ''strange'' comming out story
I am confusion???
whats going on lol.
This is my first time with sfu mail,
after the sem I haven't touched anything school related until today heh, so idk how to fix this
So me and my friend started playing val again and want us to learn comms such as heaven and all of that,
now I know what heaven is but I don't know others and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If your still confused ill give a scenario "I hit the jett, shes in heaven" like the location.
Shes an awesome cook does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but shes not a good cook either LOL.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well
she cant be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or its a guy)
She's all nice and sweet to everyone else but she's just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong(not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it. Which is wrong,
when she is there she doesn't do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren't there.
The worst part about it is people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The "false advertising" on thr A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill were it says multiple buffs cant co exist.
Maybe im the only one but i think this is all dumb and alsp kills a lot of peoples excitement.
I dont like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star lol.
Its just like zhongli.
He was fine but everyone freaked because he wasnt doing enough to dumster content and was balanced.
Ive seen lots of ppl in the fandom make rude/racist comments about liberty and its disgusting
please leave her alone.
And you do realize shes black?
stop making fun of the actors ethnic features
its honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general
its not even funny
honestly its just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And its not even just liberty I've seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmys hair.
(also mods please dont take this down
I really want people to see it and I have done nothing wrong
I've been having some of my post randomly deleted for no reason)
( As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guac.)
She then told me we gave her less meat when I brought back THE SAME PLATE sans guac.
SHES HOME FOR THE FIRST TIMEE
SHESS FINNALLY BACKK
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my pup im her crate at night bc if i dont she will poop on the floor.
So theres already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then i have work - which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my corgi in my bathroom at this time because if i dont she will reek havoc unsupervised.
AITA for starting a fight with an old friend (Strong Swearing)
Even better for me it would be:
It would be an unbeleafable loss to leta broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, downthe sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of themerchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.
"Y-y-yyy-yes sire! May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!”
"Now get lost! This is no place for desease ridden vermin like you.”
"O-off course my lord!”
I ran. Back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and furhter out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on snapchat with my friend,
me and my friend were arguing as a "joke" and then she said she prefered older guys, and my friend was (M14) and i said im a year older than you, and she says "what i mean by older guys i mean age 17" and it hurt my heart.
TLDR; my crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and im 16 and shes 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here but idk if I am the butthole or entitled one this story,
this is short but I was expecting to get a tat for my 18 bday like any 18 year old but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to
I dm the artist I wanted but nothing for 2 months
like yea I understand they booked for summer tats but at least say "hey I am booked for the rest of ____"
but I was like ok will I am gonna look at another artist work from this shop that does small tats
same thing happens no answer
so me and my brother decides "ok let's go to the shop and ask then we well at least get a answer"
we go and this young girl attends us lets call her (brenda)
I told her everything,
brenda said "well u can do the tat with me"
I said "I'll be back i'll think about it"
I got back in the car and scroll through her work
it was good work so I went back and told her yea let's do this
I signed everything
she didn't even ask for ID which I found weird bc I gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on
I brushed it off since shes new and all
she worked on me for a hour told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her
I was like ok great thanks,
4 weeks passed and there was alot of mistakes made bc I got a small tat heartbeat with a ";" in the middle but the period on top was a small heart
the right side of the heart was smaller then the other side and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again
So I reset it and yeah oops was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn't dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry ? and like through text she kinda sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if shes mad and like she said shes only abit let down ?
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me and like i apologized to her and she said its alright .
Then i just told her im going to sleep and she just left my message on delivered and like she didnt reply to today.
How to tell whether she's mad at me or just annoyed cuz rn im really confused
WIBTA if I was just be a bigger sarcastic Asshole to another Asshole?
Her tumors are behinning to open through her skin, she wont jump, pain killers dont help, she ate a lot yesterday but wont eat or drink today, she hid most the day but..... Its hard because shes alert.
It feels wrong because she looks at me like "i love you.
Im happy your here with me"
but the vet said she wasnt even supposed to live this long and the tumors will only get worse and even if we had done chemo, it would have only prolonged it.
friend told my girlfriend something,
she then broke up with me,
i dont know what to now because she and the ex friend where the only people that i had.
what should i do to try and regain my relationship because shes helped me through alot over our 2 years of dating
TLDR gf broke up with me bc something someone said and i want to regain relationship with my gf
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee bc shes a poc with tattoos and"fits the part" of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up bc I need to protect my staff but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex looooves kids.
She was playing captain save a hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman's situation with this girl's "crazy" baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in eachothers life.
it hasn't even been two months!!!
IM SO HURT.
SHE NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A LIFE WITH ME.
I KNEWWWWW she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, soon as he sawThat I was weeping, answer'd, "Come with me."
Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.
Ent'ring he led me with him on the boundsOf a great circle itself encirclign a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land with lava pyramids cover'd,With sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life Save for those imprison'd in it, who, though they surroundedUs, dar'd not approach for fear of master.
As mine ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, Cries, and explosions that made th' eternal airTremble, caus'd by slaughter, starvation, withering, and Grief felt by those multitudes, many and vast,Of men, women, and children.
Theyve grown out to the point they look kinda awkward and shes saying i should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something Id like better?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
SHE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME CLOTHES THAT FIT ME
IM DYINGGGG
SHES SO SUPPORTIVE AND NICEE OMGGG
So its 0:34 the first of January while posting this and my Sister (f14) just Ruined my New Year by Calling my Mum Fat and telling her shes a drinker when she Poured herself a glass of champagne, wich she only does on her Birthday on chrismas eve and on New year.
Now my Parents are pissed of, my grandparents are pissed off and my Sister thinks she was Funny.
The same thing happend on Chrismas eve and now the whole feeling of new year is gone and i hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sry for spelling
Screw INTJ’s.
Why they gotta be good at EVERYTHING?!
It was a MISTAKE getting the booster the day before new years.
I feel like absolute dog water.
literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and i almost cried🙏
im so happy bro.
shes so cool.
im gonna ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :)
also, happy nye/happy ny everyone!!
first of all, the satisfaction i get from saying i am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
a high i’ll never come off of.
second of all, customer comes in for the second time mad because i didnt do copies from a book because of copyright.
she goes "well i called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that".
and im like ?? ma’am its in our policy
idc what customer service says.
she keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes "make my copy"
like lol not when you act rude like that.
our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and shes such a cuddly, loving, little girl and i love her cuddles every night and in the morning
im just scared that she isnt gonna be like that after she gets fixed?
am i over thinking it?
do you think since shes in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she'll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I domt fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently shes been asking me if i'll fart infront of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and its weirf shes never heard me do it.
I can't believe she saying im depressed looking while shes so shy girl and weird thinking she's not,
so delusional
i hate it,but they are mine only friends,
she calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to d2 after several year, now I’m windering:
Where do you guys sell/buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game "O xxx N yyy" and hope for the best?
Or are there a website that’s more efficient?
Mine friends are mean and delusional,
one is immiture and shy and always pulling me down,
other is fine just jealous and its getting on my nerves,
what to do?
This is a set up I can live with.
My bf and my's fear however is in a few years when we're ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own bf.
I'm very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow anymore pushing of the boundries.
What do I do here?
Boundry Issues w/ my boyfriends alter
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was upfront when we met and said shes sh** at texting, and has apologies when we were speaking for slow replies, something which I said don’t worry, I know your busy!
Convo seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation,
however I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread) but she’s viewed my story & posted a story since,
it was NYE.
So i was all ready for the new year actually thinking positive and the changes im going to make etc
then i see hes posted a picture of them both that shes took saying 'love of my life'.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face
Exes bf posted a pic of them :(
Everytime i ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even tho shes older wtf) and that i shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her,
she drains the life out of me,
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently ive been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, i could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brang herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great
im sooooo happy.
On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat.
I look on it again i see jane but this time i can look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So i just got my first beardie.
Hes only a moth old and like most new owners im worried about if hes or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day but so far ive only been able to feed about 6-7 crickets .
Ive tried feeding him some vegies too but the guy doesnt show any interest in them.
Is there anything Im doing wrong or is he just fine and im overly worried.
Then I foundout about this really cool website called Complex.
Theyre sort of like journalism but better since theyre all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through complex.
before I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic but travis scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
now i like tame impala and ive started dressing weirder, i bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully ill wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromitise himself/herself on social media?
is it just me cringing at the twitter posts by albatross?
everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
hes making it seem like xvg is a sinking ship atm and its doing fine.
soo i have this friend IRL.
man the dude is known everywhere.
hes got a solid rep in the streets, in the jails, everywhere this guy goes everyone knows him.
he was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on reddit because i feel like i'm not really known.
how do you get hella karma?
Im 21 hes about to be 23,
my issue is that he seens to have no ambition anymore,
he doesnt work and doesnt make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an emt,
he failed it the first time by 2 points and I think he fears failure that he doesnt really want to try anything anymore.
Hes been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
Ive gotten super smough about 5 times but i always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear im far enough away but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
Im using 2H battle axe +10gargoyle helm and naked (even with tattered armor it doesnt seem to make a difference)Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know throwing myself at them enough times ill get them but its slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do but i seem to always get caught in a dumb combo or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or noticed the letter I put in there, annnd now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you, you read this sentence wrong too?
*WELL NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION*
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :^)
19/F Aww shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time
If I just wana make draven my 1 carry how should i do it.
I know hes a good unit but what items can turn him into a god.
I tried heali g sword n rfc but i get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character
however his shield is gun is op and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets thats fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate because it got absorbed.
Idk about other players oppinions but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so hes not op evough to counter everything.
Tell me what you ppl think
I didn't think anything of it so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him the EK started screaming "MOOOOOMMYYYYYY HE STOOOOLE MY COOOOOOKIES!!!"
At first I was startled
i started to get nervous and i froze.
Then EP walks up and starts yelling "GIVE THOSE COOKIES FROM MY DAUGHTER GIVE THEM BACK!!"
And I did not know what to say at first but then something came so mind just say " but I didnt."
But the way I said was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That's when my dad noticed (hes old sad he didn't realise a little bit ealier)
he called a manager to the seen and the manager told us to continue and he'll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We're both xxx majors (I'm a dual xxx and yyy major while she's a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn't say I'm smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I'm a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off.
I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences.
I looked over my bank stanments and there is was.
My NEW prim bill.
I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport.
They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.
The next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me.
We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed.
Both dated added up to what i had told her before.
She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tmrw im no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach put all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance and he messaged me on friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said i didnt change anything.
After that part of the convo ended i asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
he said that hes good when he doesnt think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him etc.
Day 1 of no contant starts tmrw.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster
we used my name and ill credit his Instagram below
hes a good guy
im glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and or story
would you guys like either home made lore or not?
i could=t post this on the fallout Reddit for some reason,
wouldn't let me put the photo
hope its good guys!
is it even possible for itsoktocry to blow up outside of the 3 songs hes had do extremly well?
Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for awhile and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much i despises griefers because they dont just destroy something in a game they destroy HOURS of work and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying im mean if i dont go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non stop how im 'mean' or a 'bad person' because im busy doing something so i cant go give him his shit.
Well I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I dont see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy,
we do get slightly tipsy ya know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a fb message saying hes ready for her to leave (she'd been there 2 hrs at this point) and then he starts passive aggressive cleaning in front of us.
Hes going through a divorce so he keeps telling me thats taking all his money.
I didnt give him a title as I didnt even get one when i bought it.
It was salvage from some guys as a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale but I've long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do y'all think its not worth it?
Also if I did want to how would i?
So I just told this guy in my class who was also weird af and gave it to him saying oof I sat on jt it broke do u just want it.
Hes like no ew.
I have ocd and immediately got ashamed and was like lol whys it gross
it's the same as a whole one and along that line like lol why and he was like ok oof it's not and I'm like lol why did you say that.
I was saying it jokingly but I'm afraid I looked weird
like wtf
whys she upset or playfully upset that I dont want it.
My hooman staff cooms home tastin of sos ages and cheez.
I think she has anovver fluff she is makin treets for.
Shud I bee sad or anger?
Wat duz yur hooman taste of wen they coom home?

anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday i finally mustered up the courage to message him.
me: hey how's everything
him: it's been time
me: sorry abt last year,
i was super awkward around you lol
him: lol nah dwai
*DRUM ROLL PLEAAE*
me: tbh i liked you blah blah blah
him: haha you could've just told me!
next time you see me just say hi.
do you still go to (school)?
I'm not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn't sit well with me.
Hey gyz just wanted to share this helpful app with you all :D .
Its not tht i am trying to promote this app or something,
it really helped me a lot
thts why thought it might evn help u gyz out .
I 've seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team ovr's and many are thinking to buy players but cant decide which will boost their team ovr's the most .
This app helps to calculate the ovr of ur team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people(f2p players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team ovr since it will result in a huge loss of coins(coz of 10% EA tax).
Whats the wecommended amount of wedicated wam i shud have to servur?

Just small info, I'm 5'9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k but I really can't hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical "u shud be good but ur not so im gunna giveu unrealistIC GOals", or should i be at 1:49?

> my name is frog
> i liek to pley
> owt in the rein
> al nite and dey
> my skin is green
> my face is coi
> u look and sey

This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Arent u all tired of seeing atleast the first two jumping into battle and wiping out ur whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying if they werent here then well the game would be balanced,
well i beg to differ cos theres akai with his insane disruption and diggie with his timely ulti or maybe even irithel might be banned cos of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly the king and queen of this game is lancelot and his beloved fanny.
Yoo know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O desidez to go to gym to do kwik workout, whatever dat iz.
She sez to me, "Yoo leave steak alone, doggo. Yoo be gud gurl!"
She tied plastik bag reel tite around steak.
Hahahaha!
Then she goes into gym and when she comez bak many furevers later, GUESS WHAT??
Hahahaha!
She open tiny car and look at me and look at steak bag....and she say, "GUD GURL!!!
Yoo leeve steak alone!"
And dat is da storee of me bein' gud gurl.
Mom-O sez she shud have brought steak into gym and left on bench next to her wiff her sweatshirt.
Sez she dum not to think of dat.
Mebbe Mom-O will git smart in a few furevers.
Now I obviously can't get out and shut it on the main road so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I've quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothings happened.
My bed smells like disease
i shud probz wash it
Pls send me some tips n stuff on what to teach him.
Currently hes doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns because thats the only gun he gets kills from.
I alrdy taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
Btw this is coming from an iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say i shud be silver and some even say plat cuz i carried a gold player)
Uk how some MFS exist?
Literally get close to u ,then all of a sudden u have problems and even tho u apologize again and again and again no it's never enuf for them .
I was in a gmeet but i told them if be back in 10 .
I forgot my ph so i went to get it and guess what them spkin abt u and backstabbing u.
U srsly don't know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
maybe i am overthinking but I'd rather die alone than live between these kinda PPL.
maybe i should just ignore them?
Or shud i give them another chance?
Or maybe i am just wierd lol
l have developed feels for my best friend.
now the question is shud l tell her how l feel about her??
will this affect our relationship tht we have.
how will she take??
ive been waiting for two years now. savings from thEn and i barely made 200usd till now.
im still styding and gaming is my dream.. and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness fom life.....,,tBh...
what shud i get?
a monitor or a gpu... ?
some of u are so lucky to get a gpu for free in here.. lol..
Aita , me (31f) asked my kids dad (43m)to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in kids room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not ment to lift too much or stretch but felt OK n thought I could do it alone .
I can't,
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of walls were I can't reach .
He said yes n today came to do it ,
after a bit said he was done and leaving,
I gave him £20 n said how greatful I am for the help .
Checked room once he left ...
both kids beds full of torn off we wallpaper , draws cracked where he stood on ,
iv still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent last 45 min picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds ,
aita if I confront him about the mess or shud I let it go n not bother asking in future
my boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when i ask dumb questions (example, i didnt know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said "why is it hard….. just fill it"
so i tried to do it but i failed.
later he was like "babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?"
then when i do it myself and dont ask him he goes "why dont you ask me, i can teach you/help you" but i refrain from asking becuz he gets frustrated
The last couple calls had arguments as he got mad cuz I beat his ass in video games (even tho gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked abt him to lots of my irl friends and they all ask why I continue to be his friend and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only ppl who actively tries to interact w him online.
yeah Ik shoes don't match.
they match the graffiti tho !
I'm trying alot of different styles so lmk what I shud change
hat: sicko by Ian conner
shoes: Nike
everything else is thrifted
ok so i swallowed a small piece of box(?) tape as i was trying to bite it off w my teeth n then i feel it in my ear😭 not ear but tht hole in my throat tht leads to the ear its jus stuck there omg😭😭😭
what shud i do lol
I don't remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida there's a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100× longer than when it's not making a sound.
I'd describe it as that trademark dessert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff , and … it’s just dude wt… heck it’s weird ,
so maybe it’s BOTH sort of a paradox (life is) but I just wanna know Hinestly did anyone else feel it ?
I want a logical explanation Plz , n if one don’t exist well I mean cuz loooong before … I was "of age" so to speak … for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate cuz I don’t drink but I’ve … hmm I’m an adult let’s put it like that
there’s other stjfff out there but Long before thag me and myFamily saw a UFO
even mg step dad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall n like … it doesn’t really scare me cuz I think it’s the way life is
things change
they don’t always have to make sense , and others say that 2.
Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling:

I reside in Hyderabad,India, currently pursuing my bachelors in computer science .
I am a candian citizen but,for enrollment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam .
Now,the doubt that has arose is...wud my admission be considered international or domestic?..
On a side note,how hard is it to be admitted to UoT's computer science program.
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
Wud preffer a hardcore clan with a plan. With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal / target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It's not a necessity but it would be nice.

Hi,I was wondering wheter or not it worths to drop some money on pets.
Like I saw how much some ppl can spend on them to get good results (like t4), and I wouldnt want to spend that much :D.
Currently I have 5 t1 pets, and I wouldnt mind to see some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping "just" 100$ would worth it.
Does it worth to drop 100$ on pets?
towards the end of senior year and tht summer idk what happened but i got a hot bod n my face was all "girl u been through some shit have a gift" so now im pretty?
I jus made a post on a diff sub about having a nice date today, which is nice, but i am vv hesitant on making frens n stuff cuz of the last two years.
so like, after my glow up or whatever more ppl started talkin to me ya?
n a lot of boys did too!
i never rlly had v many frens so this was a huge yay!
the first boy i hung out with was rlly nice but then we got high and i did vv regrettable things i do not like.
Well tht boy was super haps n told lots of boys.
I dont want to jinx it and call them out by name but im talking with a company and im hoping it works out!
Im excited about all things ill be able to do with these free promo products to help other ppl and possibly get them off some or all of their rx drugs!
Im excited for myself because i have a bunch of medical issues that i do not use rx drugs for and the other stuff i buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others and it will help this company as well.
Im ready, im ready!
Im hella excited!
Might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do - plants now waaay small for its age imo and started to grow pistils
- should I chop n restart or ???
Will be posting more here once I get...comfortable again.
(Self love is impt!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through ~ will get to them when I can :3
In the meantime, happy new year!!
ps: I don’t have a SC & don’t take any $$$, I just like to.. show off, y’know closet slut things :) lol
Ttyl y’all
He said "shhh just kis me you fool".
I still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said "No. You're f***ed up now.
Whats going on?"
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says "good lord wtf happened.
I gotta garden
ttyl".
He read my reply which said "I'm so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated".
I just don't know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him, but I don't want to be held in limbo.
I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know when ever I say ttyl or gn or whatever I wanna add an ily. Just casually. To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten fold.
I know sometimes I day dream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
Makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
Tbh I kinda hope it is bc I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof is it hitting me hard.
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I(will takes days or a week to respond) but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to atm.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick ttyl either tbh.
Finally they seem to want to engage w/ me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then day of.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on and it’s not like we’re really talking so I just block them.
Idk, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival,
I'm still "Ocean Serene" but maybe I'm .. idk that's a tough thing to say, I never thought that my gf was just a random,
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said allot of things, I'm gonna agree that if I change the world changes,
the advice you get, it's allways iffy,
I want to speak for everyone but at the same time I can only speak for myself,
also I went to get some rum and coke,
I got coke and a few other people seen it so they bought some coke.. erm, I hope my friends are ok (that's all you weirdos I'm talking about)
random story I know,
tbh I'm not ok, but I'm surviving like usual,
actually I'm all just a bit Right and fine.
Ttyl
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, its 8 hrs to [redacted]. 7 to [redacted].
not a big deal
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles an hour drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] i spose [redacted] or [redacted]'s wife ratted me out.
maybe i should block them too
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you and we can see how well that went.
[me] shiiiiiiiiit. betrayal
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self gratification.
I was in a toxic rs for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our rs we were great.
One day both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
Im going to admit that sometimes when i feel jealous i just want her to reassure me like how i reassure her that its all good but she will only reassure me once and then said bye or ttyl.
Most of the time in an argument its always my fault,
she wont admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight wont continue anymore
And I said "But yeah yeah you right."
And he said "Ye well I gtg. Im doing something" and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the convo started.
But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped.
Like what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doenst like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that.
If he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.
Idk what else to put Besides that i hate the current circumstance of life i live in
im gonna give a little insight tomorrow
Ok i lied
i have to reveal my age tomorrow because if i dont Itll mess up the story
Um Idk what to type so ill type a worry i have
Umm i dont think ill get the tapegun intime
Ok bye ttyl everyone
she said something like "but i want to make sure that we go as a friend?" thing and i was like "okay, i know" and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said "ofc i like my long time bf"
yea, whatever right haha
and here's my question...
yesterday when i was at work, she msg me saying something like "how's your work doing" and i kinda reply her with cold tone saying "i'm at work ttyl" and then she kinda upset :" Okay, i mean i understand you are at work so busy but u didn’t cut me off like this before so i kinda get it that you dont want to talk anymore like before.
got it!
bye!
How do you get destiny delicacies
I've seen a few ppl have them but I've never got one
idek where you get them
if anyone knows it would be alot of help☺
and my machine f!@#ing freezes up
it's been happening for like 2 days now...
this machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3d scanner but 4 browser tabs on reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% OF MY DAMN MEMORY AND 60% of my cpu power and freezes the wholedamn thing up.
HEY! WAIT!
i've got a new complaint! ..... Seriously WTF are you devs doing???
stahp plz
If you think it's rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying "gotta go I'll talk to you later" then it's also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one off,
things happen,
maybe something came up and you got distracted etc.
But EVERY SINGLE PERSON ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It's really not that hard to just say "gotta go, i'll text you later" or "so and so just got home, TTYL"
Even just "bye" or "BRB" or something!
Today i got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if i did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn't wanna ignore them just to talk to me,
i said it wouldn't be a problem if he had just said something like "i can't talk rn" or "im with my friends ttyl" or just literally anything.
He then said i was overthink stuf and i should " chill out" so i left it at that.
So AITA and over thinking things?
AITA for gerring mad at my bf after he ignored me for a few days
So I would usually post this on r/keto but that sub is soooooo intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But like, a girl’s gotta rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
Have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like "bitch, CALORIES PUHLEAZE"
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their no cheat days mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten free dairy free carb dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
Afaik, the concept of mini album is only around in kpop (maybe jpop?)
Im always dissapointed when a long awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5 songs album.
I can tolerate debut album since you really dont have a lot of material, but if youre snsd or something and you come out with mini after years long hiatus like mr mr, its kinda insulting.
idk what to say lol
i'm pretty funny not only bc i manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often but also because i'm just fuckin hilarious tbh
i'm from yorkshire and that probably makes me cooler than you bc the north is just superior and i'm ready to die on this hill but ig we can be mates
i would really like some of those
ok i'm running out of people to laugh at my jokes
17m from the uk,
pls be able to hold a conversation lol
Idek what kind of dog this was but it was so ugly
my god who would own such a thing.
Dogs with wrinkles like pugs, char pays(idk how to spell it), bulldogs, boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all, I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally be told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness/ over nose-can’t breathe)
and yes I know I’m gonna get shit on my all the fuckin neck beards on reddit that just ADORE their snot nose little pug,
idec
I’m so tired of people and they’re dogs.
Everytime i listen to him sht makes so much sense, even tho i dont know what he is talking about,
that leads me to belive that either that guy is a genius who can articulate whats going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something?
I mean what should i listen to if i rly wanna find out the truth if schiff is just "bias to Gold" and thats the reason why he is so hard on the current economy etc.
Do boobs=nice, coz idk never seen em before
then he check the oil level saying that the oil also smell like gasoline that gasoline and oil is mixing up together
open one spark plug see the massive leak in there literally full up
"let me say oil" smell like gasoline
I didn’t smell that one
that’s what the worker told me
then he call his boss and the boss say is not gasoline is just oil "that shit smell like gasoline 🤦🏾‍♂️
even the worker confirm that I ain’t crazy but ayyy maybe I am
and his worker" Told me he going to sealed the black thing that goes in top of the spark plug that covers it
"sorry my English not that amazing"
he said he was putting a sealed after draining the oil as he mentioned
is oil drained the oil sealed the thing so oil don’t drip out of it and don’t drip to the floor
but didn’t help me find the cause of why is oil getting into the spark plug because a sealed on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️
telling me if the problem keeps on is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way to much oil and is causing the oil leak that if the problems persist I will have to remove it
Sorry for the long paragraph but need advices,
need help tbh
My rabbit didn't eat or drink so I went to check him,
its been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food idk.
(He has constipation so Imma check does he poop.)
How do I sleep if i have to check out my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is gonna become chaotic lol.
i assume the time has already passed for this but idk i figured i may as well ask,
i kinda forgot i even had those tix until they announced they'd be touring again today
Now, my aunts (gma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated gma both before and after she passed.
When my gma first started getting sick, sis wasn’t the best bc she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but gma was also scared of covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job i couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back & forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
WIBTA if i didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So i mett this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dateing.
Last night everything was all right she was happy said good night anda ily like every night.
And the next morning when i texted her good morning she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad af all day because of me and but diden't want to say why.
Idk what i did.
I did nothing.
What should i do.
How can i contact her.
Should i give her space?
My gf blocked me and idk why
Mines ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in witch I have a F,
this is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I've done but are nowhere in the books,
this kinda snuck up on me cause I thought they were done and filed only to check my grades and find out they weren't.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you at going say "ikr I only have a 89, why couldn't she round up, fml)
Imma be honest that's not very helpful rn
so first off bard top
what a pick ikr.
lets drop down my main build cause its the best assasin play style i like.
* my core is static/ie/RFC.
now i tried many ways and this is the best way
i like to safely clear and lay out poke.
now under certain occasions like vs a garen id go what many would call shot gun bard swaping out static for runnans and if needed Rfc for pd.
giving some more tank..
now as for the other two i actually leave them more optional picks in the ap department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain
id pick up hextech gunblade
this item is phenomenal on bard on hits are great.
if your already carrying hard id go something like lyiandries cause with the lead no one will catch you with this and the chunk is just bardo crazzzzyyyy.
yet two try gunblade and lyandries together but someday.
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years; we're both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It's driving me crazy, how to deal?
This wouldn’t be an issue if y’all servers ask in the beginning do u guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.
Also why restaurants have to be set up like that
why u can’t just get up to the cashier and pay ur fucking share or food.
Hey guys bard main,
just join reddit after finding out there are other off metta bards!
So i main him top,
yes its scary but i do.
So i been getting alot questions about my builds from friends and happy on lookers lately!
thought i share my builds!
Im 16 years old 5'9.
Im new to basketball and id like to ask for drills i can do by myself so i can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I dont have a decent shot nor a decent handle,
i could barely reach the backboard plus i have no friends so dont even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why i wanted to be good at it so bad is because i just want people to know me as somebody cuz right now im a nobody,
i want to be SOMEBODY.
PS. Ive never played an actual basketball ever in my life.. ikr?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising ykno) but p chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when i want to be), goofy, a lil chaotic, big overthinker kinda deal.
Enneagram type 4 bc apparently that matters (jk !!!)
Honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love ... you get the gist :)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist so a program with med school prerequisites would be preferable,
plus, I plan to take my med school abroad (wow big dreams much?
I doubt I'd get in but it wouldn't hurt to try tho).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me,
I'd be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh and location too.
I'm short so if my classes are ~far~ I might as well roller skate my way through campus jk jk.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, ya know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would've prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do
the player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now but I dont know if I want to pursue her
its complicated.
Right now its summer break so imma wait til school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person cuz they dont talk to me online lol.
I dont know how long this series will go but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I dont know how long this is gonna take but probably quite awhile.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I dont have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say, that if youre a kid, like an elementary school kid and youre here, where the fuck are your parents???
Lol nvm fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Cause I got them and no one to give them too lmao jk unless..........
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium sprite and a mcdouble?
So idk why o got on everyone nerves about the separate checks....
Hey, hi!!
Haha... Im new here, didnt know this existed until now.
Iam exteremly shy and dont know what Im doing here typing this hahaha.
But hey, first time for everything right??
If we dont click and you lose interest then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry lmao.
I dont expect to get any messages but hey its worth a try.
Ps. I dont know how to write these properly so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format omo
Oh and if I dont reply soon it might mean Im asleep or playing DnD hehe.
Nvm
my internet is down rn
fuck
Well I'm going to see if I can buy some stuff off steam now...
let's hope there's still some good sales
Okay so I was a totl noob and earesed my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was gonna use but I sent monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
or how do you open the .key file
edit: nvm I'm a complete noob
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive monero wallet seeds with .keyfile?
user765123: no i just had the "is now playing" thing show up

So i can guess ur gender based on ur post history
Nvm..lemmee guess ur gender instead
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the prof is Oct.18.
*(edit. nvm, this part isn't true pls disregard).*
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is Feb.9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the prof that I'm dropping the course,
do I also have to get permission?
I'm planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits btw.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I rlly wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like "what!?" reallyyy loudddly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say "nvm" cuz I felt like I was in the mf spotlight.
But every time, my nmom says that can't be true because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
"It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?"
Umm idk, maybe its bc we're DIFFERENT PEOPLE with DIFFERENT BODIES???
Tbh, have anyone ever experience fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn't die and manage to kill aleast one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch BUT rampage didn't pop his ult yet.
😲Wtf?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky af fighter, and a carry that solo everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1
When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.
I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, always. Possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in....
oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
like now I feel guilty for smiling.
nvm the fake ones ish, but fuck.
haha. ugh.
why am I still alive.
lol why tf does smiling hurt
Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME.
i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE.
HE SAYS "WHATS UP" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER.
I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS.
AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD.
IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING.
BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD.
I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS,
THEN I LOOK BACK UP.
PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS.
Edit: yes I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen. Useful, I know.
But URGHHHH. They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
Btw there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: nvm. I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance, oops now I'm not getting any mp!
Try to type in chat, "I will not cheat on this game!"
message repeats every time I hit enter.
WTF
im not cheating.
anyways I type those words into the chat ( "I will not cheat on this game!") and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Wort way to tell a player to turn off Adblock but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player
10/10 never play again
EDIT: nvm, anytime I type in the chat the same shit happens
I'm gonna skip the oscar-bait shit like The Post because there's only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Dems making movies about how (Extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) "politics used to be moooorrreeee poollliitte we neeeeed a return to The Discouuurrrse."
I'm sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.
2mo ago I bought a cheap '95 nissan truck,
I was only locally driving so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn't put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd **only** when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can't rev it past 3k in my driveway w/o feeling like I'm going to break something,
I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it,
it'll hit close-to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule-out what could be causing this power-sap, IE is it the air/fuel or a clogged cat/exhaust/etc or something entirely different?
I ruled-out 'different', I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in Neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone elses nmom treat you like you're overreacting about your period pains?
Hey! Read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangeroes,
is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2mo boston terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside
friends think she said that cuz she was w her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up etc.
others think its a way for her to be evil, like think of me cuz im never coming to get that charm.
i think its some type of hoover, good or bad.
any insight is appreciated.
if your a woman please tell me your perspective.
so confused, bt she is clearly w someone else and why she couldnt call me back and why she didnt respond to my txt msgs.
she couldve said im w my bf please dont call me bt she didnt.
Just a side note: my bf and i are buying a house.
we will be moving out in 2mo.
Once the papers are all finalzed.
I have an Australian shepherd 9mo.
My bf (24m) and i (25f) got her at 3 mo.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with a black lab and a dog small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a rat terrier.
Thier play style is boxing.
And one of my roomates (25m) has a beagle.
He doesnt like to play much
infact he seems kinda scared too.
i know all of these things about my dog.
i know that it doesn't matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise; doesn't matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business;
what matters is that my dog is nervous
-- so when i hold my hand out and tell you, no, he's not sitting or lying down because he's calmly waiting for you to say hi, it's because he's nervous and insecure, i DON'T mean it as a joke, and it's NOT an invitation for you to say, "AW WELL MY DOG/CHILD IS VERY FRIENDLY SO LET ME APPROACH!"
i don't care if your dog/child is friendly or "dog savvy".
i don't care if your dog "is just a puppy"
(why the hell is that even relevant?
is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies? ??????).
i don't care if your child is capable of not screeching "OMG A PUPPYYYYYYY".
can you, y'know, DO something about your child? and also your dog?
But with less than 3mo to go for that i feel I'm not ready yet but having never taken it I have nothing to compare it to besides collegues advice.
Without knowing what I know they can't know if I'm actually ready yet but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this...bad...amd it would be awesome to be done 6 mo from my intro exam.
I'm close... I just don't know if I'm 2mo study close.
Somm certified advice
(M/5'10"/26/165-195lbs) 2mo progress, gaining too much weight?
Passed my faa ppl written!!!
I know this sounds weird but heres my issue,
about 4 months ago i had an 3700X which died after start crashing when i tried to play games and a day later not booting,
send to rma, they confirmed the cpu was dead and gave my money back after 2mo,
after that i got an 3800X,
as soon as i tried got the boot code 7b everything power up but no reboots or video signal,
send to rma this time with the store
after 1mo they confirmed the cpu was falty send me a new one,
i got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom(T) has always been the type where her feelings matter 1st + only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone elses fault entirely.
Ex: I needed some1 to babysit our then 2mo for 3-4 hrs.
Dads work had som1 who had COVID,
we opted out of them watching our son + askd my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her *before* I set it all up b/c I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its *my fault* \+ she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her *days* after the incident b/c she didnt call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing,
T promptly got off the phone,
I nvr got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to Ts narcissism.
I dont expect an apology from T b/c she **nvr** has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
WIBTA for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5mo, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2mo he's co-sleot with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I've been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get 2mo baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (Currently replacing pacifier every hour)
FTM to a sweet 2 month old girl and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
FTM struggling with sleeps
So i already have an orange golden chinchilla ( toto - 2mo old) and we have had toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got terri (2 mo himalayan ragdoll) too keep eachother company.
Its only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor?
just always goin "bRRrrRRrrRRrr".
Im not sure if she has a blocked nose because toto, never made this kind of sound....
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
Can’t play till 2moro but wyd like to know so I can make money hunting or robbingeverything and everyone
How much do pelts sell for online???
Alright y’all. I think I mis-tagged this earlier so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily w a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, & lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, **I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running** (I have no issue w being over 12+ ft from other ppl / usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually im quietly confident goin into these games but with injuries, players missing etc, im kinda happy if we get a draw.
I know they're utter pish and paper wise we should be wiping the floor with them but just not feelin the 2/3 nil vibe atm!
Anyone wanna talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
this is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait nvm shit meme.
i was 6 and playing lego rockband,
i decided to ask for the buddy holly pack.
my parents(despite being in theyre 40s) said "how the shit do you know that"
i never realised that my parents got into weezer.
so thats how i got into weezer
I genually don't understand how "toxic" behavior is more pusished than literally int or troll.
Well I've had an account which always recieved those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until i got in a bad streak of losses in ranked and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior.... And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in game chat for toxic behvaiour after a report doesn't understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait till the morning but then I said nvm I just realized it’s almost 2
I’ll just wait
and then he asked what would happen if I ate it rn and I said nothing
it’s just too late
now he’s telling me to just say fuck it and just eat the cereal
so inspiring but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :(
Before I realized it was 2

I know your skin isn't perfect or you're insecure about your nose or looks.
but those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You're beautiful because you're YOU
Rant over
actually nvm.
God. why did you give me this huge ass nose.
i'm too ugly to even rant on snapchat so i do it on reddit instead
ok it's over nowhopefully
Can I get a rip in the chat boys,
I was trying to go to sleep bc I couldn’t when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says bc she only said my name in all caps and then an nvm.
Fuck.
I just realized im complaining over a 5 minute fix..
Had never heard of this "influencer" before and consider myself pretty internet saavy.
I then lost interest in her bc her IG wasn't that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out and then I took a great interest in checking in on her bc I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while:
How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her $$ bc she claims to not being able to afford food or rent or whatever when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers which aren't cheap.
I don't like him or anything but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my bf with him.
I wouldn't do that to him ofc but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
me: im highkey liking boys more rn
lol this is no culture
Still trying to effing finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.

That's like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying "ahh nvm I want to eat somewhere else" as soon as they're bringing the food out.
I played a game as rengar and i was 6/2 and got solo killed by anvia who didnt have roa or tear finished yet
i looked over at the replay 100 times and all i can think to my self is if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did the anvia will win cna
some one plz explain WHY THE FUCK AN ANIVIA IS STRONGER THEN A RENGAR IN A 1V1 WHEN THE RENGAR HAS A GOLD LEAD?
actual nvm dont care
just quting this brain dead game
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage & both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds & says "NVM" so I just gave her mines & went on with my day.
Im so sick of hearing the same beats of mexican music ahhhh

People go in the dark alone.
No one could be THAT stupid!
If there's a ghost in the house, why the HELL would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a lil too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they're screwed.
4. The f**k you splitting up for?!
There's always this one guy in horror movies that's like: Guys, there's a crazy a** killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed!
That's EXACTLY what the killer WANTS!
basically I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again cuz my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her) and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this reddit has been is "true_warrior is a bad person, oh nvm hes good" and "p90 is broken im quitting the game".
lol nvm I'm still here in can't sleep

Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise,what with having an storyline that doesn come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as Over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and neccesary amount of seriousness and comedy,
the characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert,Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events dont always have to rely on Neptune presence.

If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all cause of your short attention span so lets keep it short(what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying "keep it short im a genius ain't i?")
Well a tryed explaining to my budds that porn is kinda shaby and yeah just bad and u know who listened.......
Hey,I just want to know what games can I run on this PC and witch nota.
I was a spy and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, mafia and sk had made their kills.
I proudly said: "I was attacked while in jail!",
wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and ask me "You were attacked while you were in jail?" and I answer "yes m8".
He then tells me that what I am saying is bs because sk and maf have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously!?
Like I don't rly care what mean shit ppl on the internet say.
But when i got nobody IRL all I have is the internet and it do kinda hurt a bit when i just want to vent my problems.
And I'd be fine if it got maybe a single upv*te and no comments and I'd be fine.
But instead, it's full of people saying
Oh boi u 2 dum for da movie boi,
da director wuz like shieeet itz bout da hiden meaningz u have 2 find boi, lyke u kno it duznt spoonfeed ya da film ya kno?
Like shieet y it gotta explain m8,
just imagine what happened ya know?
It's no like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has ya kno?
yet when fully charged for the 1st 30-60 minutes, it's always on!
which is beaaaautiful!
Lastly, if i do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping) the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off?
wtf m8?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone? or is it just me?
in searching google i cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues i am really enjoying the mod.
its just a fuckin' ball ache every single time i want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before i can puff...
Everytime i log on i want to chill afk nmz and play xbox and be fat right but, lately i log on play rs afk for like 20secs and i get logged out and its fucking annoying
is it my Internet connection or is it the servers or what
its pissin me off m8
Next we have my Stats class and I didn't realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework and so my grade was a 70 something and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my Band class is basically easy A as it's show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert and so I passed that gg ez m8.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do NOT go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like "wtf m8?" and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there,
did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This years rookie game is actually going to be real exciting,
wt line ups u wanna see
I love this Show but sadly I’m near to finish it already,

I don't like when ppl type huge ass paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me bout their problems
I don't like when ppl mumble on the phone or if they ramble on and it's all about then.
But now it just doesnt make sence, you only get 1 ticket per match and if you are lucky you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the 1 thing F2p was always abble to do because of the low cost of entrence and the rewards where good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you didnt like him. Use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you dont like the new WT than dont play it.

My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No. Fking. Competition.
Most men this day are thirsty af.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs.
And i mean that literally.
BUT – thats good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24) M an accountant at a traveling company
we ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today i called one of our agents and a girl picked up
she was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts and she said yes i will be at your company at 2100
i said ok, and at 2100 she came by and asked who is the accountant
i said i am please follow me to the room,
she came and i asked her how much did she bring
she said i have $1300 with me , which will not cover all of their debts btw, so i brought a reciept and write down the amount and the company name and the i asked her for her name
she smiled and looked at me and said my name?

Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that,
she probably already have one also.
A real digital movie camera cost sooo damn much.
So I opted for an analogic one.
Now, 8mm/super have an affordable price, 16mm don't cost much, and 35mm cost A LOT so I think I'm going for a super 8.
But then how does it work?
Lol. I mean I buy her a super 8 but I should also buy her a videorecorder, and some VHS.. things like that,
Idk how it work.
Pls can someone explain to me what should I do

Hi guys, this year was my third year at glasto and I loved it sooo much and hope u guys did too !
Maybe a lil earlier idk cause I'm usually at work but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mbs range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more ppl are at home I'm gonna see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60.
I am an aspiring doctor/med student and so seeing alot of med related subjects as early in our first sem I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!!
I passed for UPLB BS Bio!
Tbh thooo this wasn't my priority program, so ofc I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be an iska but I was also worried bcos I'm not rlly as interested in Bio as invested I already was in PT.
Sure I could learn to love bio, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year but that's not certain.

Looking for single bedroom flats or flatshares is a legit issue as 3 letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
VACUUM WONT STOP SUCKING PLEASE SEND HELP, IS IT GONNA BLOW?
Basically if you didn’t know what that is,it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says "Lets eat granny" making it seem like someone’s gonna eat their nan.
However,the other example says "Lets eat,granny" implying a different meaning to the sentence.
Pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas ig.
I literally couldn't have been more at fault
just drove straight into this woman's golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it)
she seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it's my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers aswell just very minor body work/paint maybe a small dent.
what boardband do i get?
ive had virgin for 8 years and holy shit is it slow for 40£ monthly.

lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn't actually laugh
LOL - adults and people who don't really know how the internet works use this
Lol - not sure why this came up but it's likely an autocorrect but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named
LoL - grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
also confusing because of league of legends.
looooooooool - now, i think my gf pronounces this but she says that this one would rhyme with "spool" but i think it's the drawn out "o".
So yeah, i think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn't exist.
lollllllllllllll - when i hear her say "loooool", this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it. but i still think that's "loooooool",
you can't repeatedly pronounce a consonant
So, when is big Ben going to bong again?

But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Prefferably under £50!
Also does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming. (Don't require me to stand for legnths of time)
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what i do i literally can't keep the dust at bay for more than 24hrs and i am losing my mind.
It's 10pm, 28c, and my bum is literally melting.

If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really tbh
Rmember, theres alot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that dosing experience alot of positive moments this sub does make me smile :)
Damn some ppl need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet geez
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kinda a lot lol), so I would reaaaaally appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I see the need bc who the fuck cares.
But now it seems that y'all done made grits without the butter and made us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were fixin to tour more plantations than Carter's got little pills but you done gone and brought up them "slave owners" now.
Ain't amountin to nothin more than a hill of beans!

All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
Y'all get along now, ya hear?
How to go from # to date?
How do I break of a relationship with my 'friend'?
basically I put my skate account in my Instagram bio cuz I have no posts on my main and I’m kinda insecure abt my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless and ppl won’t expect me to be like shredded or sum shit if they add me) and today I got like 3 followers (girls from dif towns who don’t know me).
im really picky tho bc I don’t wanna have a relationship unless I actually feel like I’d really fuck w the person and be into them a lot so I didn’t follow any of them back.
bro ive gotten added and unadded on ig so many times today that it’s kinda a confidence boost lmao
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from ppl who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers smh..
Nothing else to say, come at me salty ppl lmao

tldr: the title
Other vegans that youre friends w tell you that they dont tell other ppl theyre vegan?
Like the purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community cause those are probably the ppl that would be more gentle w their words, which is what some ppl need in order to listen.
Im a very straightforward, no sugar coating typa person, and although some ppl appreciate it, a lot more get upset & start trying to put words in my mouth &twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like 300€ worth of fake internet points, like wtf are you doing honestly LOL
Why would you give awards to ppl lol
i just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre googling and confirmed the time that ill be there at.
If she gives any further resistance I think ill just next her/ ignore/not respond / agree with her that she can't handle the place , or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first frikken date
Yes i agree things like tumblr made up identities are weird and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted calling ppl snowflakes is just weak
Give your self a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without ANY unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series! Props to you!
the New Year’s eve Raticate w hat.
haven’t found him anywhere yet.
anyone want to raid?
need a few ppl quick.
Stop.
I think what i am trying to say...this game is not hard.
Dont make it hard urself.
The main objective as i understood is to get the dragon. And dont die till that.
Even beter if u outfarm ur oponent.
Just dont die.
And trades in lane...if u see enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights but he was out of town
so we couldn’t do that- and now he’s back in town and I asked him what he’s doing on New Years and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers form our work
and likeeeee he didn’t offer an invite and then he said if he cancels with them would I like to come over and I just said idk what I’m doing yet so I don’t know
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There’s gonna be ppl on the internet saying "stat padder" but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid

Just kind of realized that I’ve never had nye plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that ..
recently realized I still don’t have enough friends to have a one for my 21st coming up...
Idk why I didn’t clue into This tho.
Like I never thought about how ppl have traditions for this night, besides my sister who goes out to her friends every year.
It’s funny that covid isn’t affecting my Ny at all..
Anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight lol.
helo, im looking for ppl to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
just please be aware that im not very good at upholding conversations uwu f/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the "aaa" word, and I want to yank four words, *without* selecting the spaces after "ddd":> xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like i see vids on yt on it.
But like, i cant see any mention on the design notes etc.
Where do ppl get the info from?
Dm me to debate
pls be well learned in your belief.
I want dms bc Itll get deep and I cant reply to 300 ppl like that.
Also I need 500 characters so here come the blah blah
I m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl but I am saying that they wont like to do it bcoz they r humans with their own choices and not agreeing to be a girl isnt making them a women anti.
Like how many guys around you would be willing to turned into disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time [but how much time?]
and maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
but knowing this isn't making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they r asked to do all this.
I wont like it if you will try to make me a man and want me to dance in front of so many ppl eventhough I am a tomboy.
Anyone missing me?
If you miss a reddit friend, read this.
IT COULD BE pME!!
So I just hopped on PC from Ps4, not even 2.5k games played there,
played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a KB&M, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with ppl 2k kills and preds even,
yet I haven't even a hundred games played and about 80kills with all characters.
Not really having fun anymore,
can't improve if I get shit on every game
I see a lot of ppl on here who seem hella said, so if u hella sad I’m down to chat.
So yeah if u down for a chat, or long term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so
so i always see ppl talk about sending designs and edits to affinity but how do i do that??
ive worked at od for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it??
like not even the print sup.
we do every type of editing in store and i hate it.
like we’re out here doing stuff that im pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to affinity based on what i see on here.
but yeah is more of this info on the store portal or where can i learn more?
im extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last minute rude customers (:
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k and i was like-Hell Nawh That Not Worth 100k- like bruh- .-.
WhY dO pPl FiNd ThE NeW SeT ExPeNsIvE
Ik the girl I posted abt is a troll ppl- but oh well she got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down
It is the bar with the team comp and the status of each characters that is use to follow report team ( like in the actual world cup) .
It can be tweak down to not reveal to much info about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier and you won't have to use tab
HMU with a chat message,
tell me about yourself and we can go from there
I dont understand how ppl can build what they do...
i love building but i guess my creativity isnt well tuned as alotta ppls an it bothers me i cant build amazing stuff
i no i could if inhave the creative side uggh
i just tend to give up after awhile n settle for simple crap to pass for ok
I care abt how I effect ppl a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in convos w big groups of ppl which is related to adhd.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kinda stand offish to ppl idk.
I’ll try to act like idc if someone doesn’t like me but drunk ppl will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all r adhd things tho bc rsd
I’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent
I can have a really really really flirty personality at times.
I remember in hs my friends mom said I had the "personality " so I’d probably be the r first to have a boyfriend
but when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds HER accountable she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects any / everyone who doesn’t agree w her and screams about how she doesn’t care
or more specifically in her words "I don’t give a fuck"
she’ll NEVER take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite
all the things she screams @ ppl to NOT do to her she turns around and does the exact same rude petty shit to any/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts JUST like my mom and my mom can’t stand it / accept that
so she becomes down right nasty.
In class I’ve usually been really quiet but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click w in class and be reallyyyy really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen b feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk thought.
I’ve always been a smiley happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have adhd.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk which I heard ppl w adhd are both.
Could I be istp ?
Help type me pls
Idk if ppl would even want to

Some ppl are just indescribable
I ain’t done this before but i’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like interests :)
we can definitely talk abt anime (especially romance imma sucker for it), we can talk abt games and go into detail abt lore and shtuff, creepy stories go hard, and really i’m just down for anything :)
i’m not gonna be weird so as long as you’re not weird
any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah if i didn’t do this right lmk :)
oh and i’ll absolutely talk more on snap
The part I'm humming is like "word word word wo-o-o-ord" x2.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like "fly-y-y-yyy."
I'm pretty sure it's a popular song, I've heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah tbh it is
i care abt a lot of ppl and i cant just... make people be happy.
But like.... i wanna :(
Just wanna make everybody i care about happy,

Hey, F/19 , bored af ,
I enjoy talking to new ppl,
hmu?!
i started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90s.
she said everyone was watching wrestling back then and it was a cool thing.
now no one gives a shit😭 (i don’t rlly blame them sometimes).
i asked her "why do u think ppl stopped liking it" and she said "cause it’s garbage.
it’s come on fox on fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hit i change the channel"
i had to include that in there bc she’s so funny😂😂😂
anyways.
Hey, Cant fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting,
hmu if u think we could hit off well,
hope we have a great time ,future chat buddy ;)😁
kinda weird ngl
These mfs can outrun, out swim or out stam (through venom) anything that tries to get it.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
just finished the show so i’m a lil behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much lol.
also by sidestory i mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
My favorite Obama quote: "Michael and I also wanna uh, acknowledge, uh.....yy...y.yy..uuuhhh..yyy....your son Jack, who deployed today."
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc
Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best game ever that I play!
But have some probs..
I’d always heard of mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple months ago and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists rn.
Anyways that was just my thoughts, Happy new years everyone hope the new year treats u well.
Now for this one it's kinda hard because the enemies are SOOO COOL for this game, but...
If I had to choose, I'd say I like the Clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not THE only enemie in the game that doesn't have a single other Variation from what I remember.
Honestly I wasn't gonna make one but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I dsagree with a lot of others list, not to say my list is right bc this is all subjective anyway which Is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!YAYYYY
Imo lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind ive only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of ep 3)unlike her father lily tries to work with lee and for the most part the group she does what she has to she is a bit of a bitch cause she has to i only have 1 problem with lily she killed carly
if you could get ben to confess yes i got spoiled on that and a few other things ben is useless he is what looks like a collage student yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7
pls dont downvote me into oblivion if i missed something
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats so 4 isn't really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kinda sucks IMO.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who lived both as a woman and as a man (not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders) so thats kinda neat imo
I don't think he did the role justice.
I feel before neo figured it out the way he was speaking was ok, but after...IMO he should of went full Hugo weaving speech.
Just wanted to share my opinion not being a united fan, on the game against burnley.
(not that many of you will care).
Mctominay sheeeeesh what a guy.
Thought that shaw was solid, now youve got two good left backs in good form.
Also wanted to say awb had a muhc better game i thought.
AFter the shitty games and dalot playing well I personaly thought awb improved alot.
Hahaha.
OMG it's terribl-....yyy funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can ONLY drop at 4-6, yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues but for me I can live with those issues but not this, pls change
Kind of an odd question imo, but I have a bp who I just got to eat f/t for the first time (yay!!!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I've tried f/t large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
Could be a fluke though.
Ik it's like a meme or something of "dark souls player complains about the combat" or something similar, but I just don't get the combat.
I can do ds3 deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately, ik not a difficult game but hear me out rq if you know the game.
OMG!
WHY do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they dont have ANY idea of how a torrent even works (its so damn easy though!) comments like "The link doesnt work" Rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
Your just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So i get tipped on the app, gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the app after?Wtf is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was LESS than the app tip...
If your are tipping both, TIP BOTH.
Ngl tft is a good mode ,but its like hs a good game to play on your phone not something to grind out all day all night like wtf ? Its not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on prep up and alt tab until its next time u can do anyhing)
any thoughts?
i know its a scientific things and all but some of the post there is just too much.
learning dream languages???
wtf?
and some bloke is saying "i tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didnt lucid dream?!" every few hours.
maybe the post are just giving a litte too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like Dear lord wtf is happening ooooh
So I am I first time cup user and i got the saalt cup at target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold+17yovirgin=ow) I got in in w/the 7 fold and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how tf am i supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails.
In one way, it kind of helped me ~find~ the cup lowkey grip but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping I'm down to my last dollars soon and I can't just eat beer and cigarettes
then I set them down so I didn't have to carry them across the street to get beer (it's cheaper at Adventures First Stop)
then I walked back and forgot my groceries walked all the way home and ah shit, I'm getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill
I live on a hill.
down.
the middle, really.
i imagine it's like an amateur San Fran so I walked back and got them.
no crime round these parts.
not much, anyway.
Didn’t think about nails...
Is he gonna tell her?
If so how would that convo go down?!!!?
Okay wtf Arlo now knows sera ( idk how to spell her full name) is Johns weakness
First of all, we've seen they are greedy as f(OK, not as other mobile studios, but stiiiiiill) Second, game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high end phones) Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
Wtf are you yanks on
See also: (on an article about how it's "40 degrees in some parts of Europe") > wtf lol that's not hot at all put on a jakcet dummies ("[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16C") > zomg thats rly cold im never moving to canada
Someines it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me tf out and gives me nods similar to codiene, why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with wether or not a woman looks at me and thinks Im ugly, if that happens I get anxious From it, but ifva women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks im decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
WTF IS GOING ON
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisble, even if they don't detect you they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I shouldve just grabbed an smg and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many trys most of them being on his second phase, his 3rd phase I beat first time.
Only me guess its so broken?
I got 7 place on last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Becuz i have less than 3000 points.
(i need 55 magaki frags and i get 50, just feel my suffering)
Also in other event with gamer764 i have \~8000 points and got 4 place and got rewards for 4 place, not for 1, whats need 7k points or more.
Are the developers too greedy?
Hope the title makes sense - Have a list of names "john.baker" (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 colums "john" and "baker" Thanks!!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were goin to see each other and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday and so I canceled it and now she won't stop saying sorry that's not what she meant.
Wtf
do I do I told her I was going on another one next month(lie) to make her feel better but I didn't.
But, I don't neccesarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks
Okay so I've got less than a chapter left in GotM and I still can't understand wtf Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I'm missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots Yhall are whack
Wtf i posted a litteral anime foot and still didn't even make most controversial post of DAY. let alone all time
So huh you cant alpha karthus ult wtf is this bs?
It would be very helpful all of you OP's out there actually said wtf it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it! Such as "now I understand why this (brand name) thing has everyone going crazy"...
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn't mean much to me.
If it's too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever that the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the "DFW teams are cursed" camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me to much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential WTF transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a pc but in the mean time I use a crappy 13 year old pc I got money for rust bought it and it took 4 hours to download 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server after I hit a tree with my rock my game crashed at this time it was 12:47 am and I just said f**k it and went to bed ready for a hull lot of s**t today

She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot n cold.
Now shes onto another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind if disrespectful to the new bf huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd, however, i will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her but i cant think of a reason why i should…
After going "uhh no?" She sends me a picture of said candle holder.
From her kitchen.
I of course go "wtf you're home??" and turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So Im beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
Tldr
:
sickly nmom went into hospital for 3 days, I find out shes home because of a candle holder.
ts been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but
its really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is i let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message i sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful bc of a song i made that i was sharing.
I was very flirtatious maybe more so than i was with my gf when i was first talking to her and that has been choing in my gfs mind.
Its been extremely difficult for her we have two dogs now i was hoping us having two pups to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again bc we have them to bond over but she still cant say “i love you too” she doesnt accept when i try to give her compliments bc ive said rude things in the past when i use to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you but i dont see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trumming my nails, wearing versace crystal noir and ither fragrances etc. Which i believe is the reason why most girls even if theyre taken at least are willing to have a convo with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self development and even though ive been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, i never let it get me down and i
m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women even though i may not have hollywood good looks or charidma like will smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and i wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :)
Shes 18 inches long & weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
Just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champ every 4-5 days and shes already longer than some males get so I'm curious!
the anime is about an mc thats in a game but she doesnt realise it but the system says shes dead and etc i would like to wath the rest of it soo plz help me.
Lookking for a anime
Idk if to others its strange, but to me it was.
I got covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so i had to tell my mum.
I couldve just lied and say it was cuz of sharing cups or kissing a girl since in BI, but i knew my parents would be accepting... so i told them as it was.
My mum was VERY dissapointed because she thought she new me well, and though i told her everything but now she couldnt trust me anymore cuz bla bla bla... basically he was very dissapointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that i didnt feel like telling her because its private to me... till today she doesnt really trust me like before, but shes ok lol.
Today its my birthday so im sharing my ''strange'' comming out story
I am confusion??? whats going on lol.
This is my first time with sfu mail, after the sem I haven't touched anything school related until today heh, so idk how to fix this
So me and my friend started playing val again and want us to learn comms such as heaven and all of that, now I know what heaven is but I don't know others and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If your still confused ill give a scenario "I hit the jett, shes in heaven" like the location.
Shes an awesome cook does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but shes not a good cook either LOL.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating wellshe cant be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or its a guy)She
's all nice and sweet to everyone else but she's just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong(not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it.
Which is wrong, when she is there she doesn't do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren't there.
The worst part about it is people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The "false advertising" on thr A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill were it says multiple buffs cant co exist.
Maybe im the only one but i think this is all dumb and alsp kills a lot of peoples excitement.
I dont like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star lol.
Its just like zhongli.
He was fine but everyone freaked because he wasnt doing enough to dumster content and was balanced.
Ive seen lots of ppl in the fandom make rude/racist comments about liberty and its disgusting please leave her alone.
And you do realize shes black?
stop making fun of the actors ethnic features its honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general its not even funny honestly its just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And its not even just liberty I've seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmys hair.
(also mods please dont take this down I really want people to see it and I have done nothing wrong I've been having some of my post randomly deleted for no reason)
( As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guac.)
She then told me we gave her less meat when I brought back THE SAME PLATE sans guac.
SHES HOME FOR THE FIRST TIMEE
SHESS FINNALLY BACKK
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my pup im her crate at night bc if i dont she will poop on the floor.
So theres already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then i have work - which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my corgi in my bathroom at this time because if i dont she will reek havoc unsupervised.
AITA for starting a fight with an old friend (Strong Swearing)
Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbeleafable loss to let a broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, down the sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.###-!-###”Y-y-yyy-yes sire!
May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!"
"Now get lost!
This is no place for desease ridden vermin like you." "O-off course my lord!" I ran.
Back down the alley I squirmed my way out of.
Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went.
Further and furhter out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on snapchat with my friend, me and my friend were arguing as a "joke" and then she said she prefered older guys, and my friend was (M14) and i said im a year older than you, and she says "what i mean by older guys i mean age 17" and it hurt my heart.
TLDR; my crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and im 16 and shes 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here but idk if I am the butthole or entitled one this story, this is short but I was expecting to get a tat for my 18 bday like any 18 year old but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to I dm the artist I wanted but nothing for 2 months like yea I understand they booked for summer tats but at least say "hey I am booked for the rest of ____" but I was like ok will I am gonna look at another artist work from this shop that does small tats same thing happens no answer
so
me and my brother decides "ok let's go to the shop and ask then we well at least get a answer"
we go and this young girl attends us lets call her (brenda) I told her everything, brenda said "well u can do the tat with me"
I said "I'll be back i'll think about it"
I got back in the car and scroll through her work it was good work so I went back and told her yea let's do this I signed everything she didn't even ask for ID which I found weird bc I gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on I brushed it off since shes new and all she worked on me for a hour told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her I was like ok great thanks, 4 weeks passed and there was alot of mistakes made bc I got a small tat heartbeat with a ";" in the middle but the period on top was a small heart the right side of the heart was smaller then the other side and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again
So I reset it and yeah oops was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn't dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry ? and like through text she kinda sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if shes mad and like she said shes only abit let down ?
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me and like i apologized to her and she said its alright .
Then i just told her im going to sleep and she just left my message on delivered and like she didnt reply to today.
How to tell whether she's mad at me or just annoyed cuz rn im really confused
WIBTA if I was just be a bigger sarcastic Asshole to another Asshole?
Her tumors are behinning to open through her skin, she wont jump, pain killers dont help, she ate a lot yesterday but wont eat or drink today, she hid most the day but..... Its hard because shes alert.
It feels wrong because she looks at me like "i love you.
Im happy your here with me" but the vet said she wasnt even supposed to live this long and the tumors will only get worse and even if we had done chemo, it would have only prolonged it.
friend told my girlfriend something, she then broke up with me, i dont know what to now because she and the ex friend where the only people that i had.
what should i do to try and regain my relationship because shes helped me through alot over our 2 years of dating
TLDR
gf broke up with me bc something someone said and i want to regain relationship with my gf
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee bc shes a poc with tattoos and”fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up bc I need to protect my staff but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex looooves kids.
She was playing captain save a hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman's situation with this girl's "crazy" baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in eachothers life.
it hasn't even been two months!!!
IM SO HURT.
SHE NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A LIFE WITH ME.
I KNEWWWWW she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, soon as he saw That I was weeping, answer'd, "Come with me."
Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.
Ent'ring he led me with him on the bounds Of a great circle itself encirclign a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land with lava pyramids cover'd, With sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life Save for those imprison'd in it, who, though they surrounded Us, dar'd not approach for fear of master.
As mine ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, Cries, and explosions that made th' eternal air Tremble, caus'd by slaughter, starvation, withering, and Grief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, Of men, women, and children.
Theyve grown out to the point they look kinda awkward and shes saying i should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something Id like better?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SHE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME CLOTHES THAT FIT ME IM DYINGGGG SHES SO SUPPORTIVE AND NICEE OMGGG
So its 0:34 the first of January while posting this and my Sister (f14) just Ruined my New Year by Calling my Mum Fat and telling her shes a drinker when she Poured herself a glass of champagne, wich she only does on her Birthday on chrismas eve and on New year.
Now my Parents are pissed of, my grandparents are pissed off and my Sister thinks she was Funny.
The same thing happend on Chrismas eve and now the whole feeling of new year is gone and i hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sry for spelling
Screw INTJ’s.
Why they gotta be good at EVERYTHING?!
It was a MISTAKE getting the booster the day before new years.
I feel like absolute dog water.
literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and i almost cried🙏 im so happy bro.
shes so cool.
im gonna ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :)
also, happy nye/happy ny everyone!!
first of all, the satisfaction i get from saying i am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
a high i’ll never come off of.
second of all, customer comes in for the second time mad because i didnt do copies from a book because of copyright.
she goes “well i called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
and im like ?? ma’am its in our policy idc what customer service says.
she keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy” like lol not when you act rude like that.
our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and shes such a cuddly, loving, little girl and i love her cuddles every night and in the morning im just scared that she isnt gonna be like that after she gets fixed?
am i over thinking it?
do you think since shes in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she'll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I domt fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently shes been asking me if i'll fart infront of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and its weirf shes never heard me do it.
I can't believe she saying im depressed looking while shes so shy girl and weird thinking she's not,so delusional i hate it,but they are mine only friends,she calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to d2 after several year, now I’m windering: Where do you guys sell/buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or are there a website that’s more efficient?
Mine friends are mean and delusional,one is immiture and shy and always pulling me down,other is fine just jealous and its getting on my nerves,what to do?
This is a set up I can live with.
My bf and my's fear however is in a few years when we're ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own bf.
I'm very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow anymore pushing of the boundries.
What do I do here?
Boundry Issues w/ my boyfriends alter
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was upfront when we met and said shes sh** at texting, and has apologies when we were speaking for slow replies, something which I said don’t worry, I know your busy!
Convo seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation, however I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread)
but
she’s viewed my story & posted a story since, it was NYE.
So i was all ready for the new year actually thinking positive and the changes im going to make etc then i see hes posted a picture of them both that shes took saying 'love of my life'.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face
Exes bf posted a pic of them :(
Everytime i ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even tho shes older wtf) and that i shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her, she drains the life out of me, I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently ive been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, i could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brang herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great im sooooo happy.
On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat.
I look on it again i see jane but this time i can look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So i just got my first beardie.
Hes only a moth old and like most new owners im worried about if hes or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day but so far ive only been able to feed about 6-7 crickets .
Ive tried feeding him some vegies too but the guy doesnt show any interest in them.
Is there anything Im doing wrong or is he just fine and im overly worried.
Then I foundout about this really cool website called Complex
.
Theyre sort of like journalism but better since theyre all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through complex.
before I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic but travis scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
now i like tame impala and ive started dressing weirder, i bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully ill wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromitise himself/herself on social media?
is it just me cringing at the twitter posts by albatross?
everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
hes making it seem like xvg is a sinking ship atm and its doing fine.
soo i have this friend IRL.
man the dude is known everywhere.
hes got a solid rep in the streets, in the jails, everywhere this guy goes everyone knows him.
he was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on reddit because i feel like i'm not really known.
how do you get hella karma?
Im 21 hes about to be 23, my issue is that he seens to have no ambition anymore, he doesnt work and doesnt make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an emt, he failed it the first time by 2 points and I think he fears failure that he doesnt really want to try anything anymore.
Hes been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
Ive gotten super smough about 5 times but i always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear im far enough away but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
Im using 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helm and naked (even with tattered armor it doesnt seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know throwing myself at them enough times ill get them but its slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do but i seem to always get caught in a dumb combo or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or noticed the letter I put in there, annnd now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you, you read this sentence wrong too?
*WELL NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION* I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :^)
19/F Aww shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time
If I just wana make draven my 1 carry how should i do it.
I know hes a good unit but what items can turn him into a god.
I tried heali g sword n rfc but i get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character however his shield is gun is op and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets thats fine.
However
I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate because it got absorbed.
Idk about other players oppinions but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so hes not op evough to counter everything.
Tell me what you ppl think
I didn't think anything of it so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him the EK started screaming "MOOOOOMMYYYYYY HE STOOOOLE MY COOOOOOKIES!!!"
At first I was startled i started to get nervous and i froze.
Then EP walks up and starts yelling "GIVE THOSE COOKIES FROM MY DAUGHTER GIVE THEM BACK!!"
And I did not know what to say at first but then something came so mind just say " but I didnt."
But the way I said was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That's when my dad noticed (hes old sad he didn't realise a little bit ealier) he called a manager to the seen and the manager told us to continue and he'll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We're both xxx majors (I'm a dual xxx and yyy major while she's a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn't say I'm smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I'm a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off.
I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences.
I looked over my bank stanments and there is was.
My NEW prim bill.
I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport.
They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.
The next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me.
We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed.
Both dated added up to what i had told her before.
She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tmrw im no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach put all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance and he messaged me on friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said i didnt change anything.
After that part of the convo ended i asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
he said that hes good when he doesnt think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him etc.
Day 1 of no contant starts tmrw.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster we used my name and ill credit his Instagram below hes a good guy im glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and or story would you guys like either home made lore or not?
i could=t post this on the fallout Reddit for some reason, wouldn't let me put the photo hope its good guys!
is it even possible for itsoktocry to blow up outside of the 3 songs hes had do extremly well? Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for awhile and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much i despises griefers because they dont just destroy something in a game they destroy HOURS of work and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying im mean if i dont go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non stop how im 'mean' or a 'bad person' because im busy doing something so i cant go give him his shit.
Well I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I dont see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy,we do get slightly tipsy ya know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a fb message saying hes ready for her to leave (she'd been there 2 hrs at this point) and then he starts passive aggressive cleaning in front of us.
Hes going through a divorce so he keeps telling me thats taking all his money.
I didnt give him a title as I didnt even get one when i bought it.
It was salvage from some guys as a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale but I've long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do y'all think its not worth it?
Also if I did want to how would i?
So I just told this guy in my class who was also weird af and gave it to him saying oof I sat on jt it broke do u just want it.
Hes like no ew.
I have ocd and immediately got ashamed and was like lol whys it gross it's the same as a whole one and along that line like lol why and he was like ok oof it's not and I'm like lol why did you say that.
I was saying it jokingly but I'm afraid I looked weird like wtf whys she upset or playfully upset that I dont want it.
My hooman staff cooms home tastin of sos ages and cheez.
I think she has anovver fluff she is makin treets for.

anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday i finally mustered up the courage to message him.
me: hey how's everything
him: it's been time

him: lol nah dwai

next time you see me just say hi.

I'm not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn't sit well with me.
Hey gyz just wanted to share this helpful app with you all :D .
Its not tht i am trying to promote this app or something, it really helped me a lot thts why thought it might evn help u gyz out .
I 've seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team ovr's and many are thinking to buy players but cant decide which will boost their team ovr's the most .
This app helps to calculate the ovr of ur team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people(f2p players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team ovr since it will result in a huge loss of coins(coz of 10% EA tax).
Whats the wecommended amount of wedicated wam i shud have to servur?

Just small info, I'm 5'9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k but I really can't hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical "u shud be good but ur not so im gunna giveu unrealistIC GOals", or should i be at 1:49?

Arent u all tired of seeing atleast the first two jumping into battle and wiping out ur whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying if they werent here then well the game would be balanced, well i beg to differ cos theres akai with his insane disruption and diggie with his timely ulti or maybe even irithel might be banned cos of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly the king and queen of this game is lancelot and his beloved fanny.
Yoo know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O desidez to go to gym to do kwik workout, whatever dat iz.
She sez to me, "Yoo leave steak alone, doggo.
Yoo be gud gurl!"
She tied plastik bag reel tite around steak.
Hahahaha!
Then she goes into gym and when she comez bak many furevers later, GUESS WHAT??
Hahahaha!
She open tiny car and look at me and look at steak bag....and she say, "GUD GURL!!! Yoo leeve steak alone!"
And dat is da storee of me bein' gud gurl.
Mom-O sez she shud have brought steak into gym and left on bench next to her wiff her sweatshirt.
Sez she dum not to think of dat.
Mebbe Mom-O will git smart in a few furevers.
Now I obviously can't get out and shut it on the main road so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I've quickly jumped out and shut it.

Aita , me (31f) asked my kids dad (43m)to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in kids room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not ment to lift too much or stretch but felt OK n thought I could do it alone .
I can't, I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of walls were I can't reach .
He said yes n today came to do it , after a bit said he was done and leaving, I gave him £20 n said how greatful I am for the help .
Checked room once he left ...
both kids beds full of torn off we wallpaper , draws cracked where he stood on , iv still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent last 45 min picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds , aita if I confront him about the mess or shud I let it go n not bother asking in future
my boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when i ask dumb questions (example, i didnt know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard….. just fill it” so i tried to do it but i failed.
later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?” then when i do it myself and dont ask him he goes “why dont you ask me, i can teach you/help you” but i refrain from asking becuz he gets frustrated
The last couple calls had arguments as he got mad cuz I beat his ass in video games (even tho gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked abt him to lots of my irl friends and they all ask why I continue to be his friend and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only ppl who actively tries to interact w him online.
yeah Ik shoes don't match.
they match the graffiti tho !
I'm trying alot of different styles so lmk what I shud change
hat: sicko by Ian conner shoes: Nike everything else is thrifted
ok so i swallowed a small piece of box(?) tape as i was trying to bite it off w my teeth n then i feel it in my ear😭 not ear but tht hole in my throat tht leads to the ear its jus stuck there omg😭😭😭 what shud i do lol
I don't remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida there's a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100× longer than when it's not making a sound.
I'd describe it as that trademark dessert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff , and … it’s just dude wt…
heck it’s weird , so maybe it’s BOTH sort of a paradox (life is) but I just wanna know Hinestly did anyone else feel it ?
I want a logical explanation Plz , n if one don’t exist well I mean cuz loooong before … I was “of age” so to speak … for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate cuz I don’t drink but I’ve … hmm I’m an adult let’s put it like that there’s other stjfff out there but Long before thag me and my Family saw a UFO even mg step dad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall n like … it doesn’t really scare me cuz I think it’s the way life is things change they don’t always have to make sense , and others say that

I reside in Hyderabad,India, currently pursuing my bachelors in computer science .
I am a candian citizen but,for enrollment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam .
Now,the doubt that has arose is...wud my admission be considered international or domestic?..
On a side note,how hard is it to be admitted to UoT's computer science program.
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
Wud preffer a hardcore clan with a plan.
With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.

Hi, I was wondering wheter or not it worths to drop some money on pets.
Like I saw how much some ppl can spend on them to get good results (like t4), and I wouldnt want to spend that much :D.
Currently I have 5 t1 pets, and I wouldnt mind to see some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping "just" 100$ would worth it.
Does it worth to drop 100$ on pets?

m excited about all things ill be able to do with these free promo products to help other ppl and possibly get them off some or all of their rx drugs!
I
m excited for myself because i have a bunch of medical issues that i do not use rx drugs for and the other stuff i buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others and it will help this company as well.
Im ready, im ready!
Im hella excited!
Might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do - plants now waaay small for its age imo and started to grow pistils- should I chop n restart or ???
Will be posting more here once I get...comfortable again.
(Self love is impt!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through ~ will get to them when I can :3
In the meantime, happy new year!!
ps:
I don’t have a SC & don’t take any $$$, I just like to.. show off, y’know closet slut things :) lol
Ttyl y’all
He said "shhh just kis me you fool".
I still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said "No.
You're f***ed up now.
Whats going on?"
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says "good lord wtf happened.
I gotta garden ttyl".
He read my reply which said "I'm so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated".
I just don't know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him, but I don't want to be held in limbo.
I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know when ever I say ttyl or gn or whatever I wanna add an ily.
Just casually.
To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten fold.
I know sometimes I day dream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
Makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
Tbh I kinda hope it is bc I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof is it hitting me hard.
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I(will takes days or a week to respond) but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to atm.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick ttyl either tbh.
Finally they seem to want to engage w/ me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then day of.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on and it’s not like we’re really talking so I just block them.
Idk, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival, I'm still "Ocean Serene” but maybe I'm .. idk that's a tough thing to say, I never thought that my gf was just a random, I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said allot of things, I'm gonna agree that if I change the world changes, the advice you get, it's allways iffy, I want to speak for everyone but at the same time I can only speak for myself, also I went to get some rum and coke, I got coke and a few other people seen it so they bought some coke..
erm, I hope my friends are ok (that's all you weirdos I'm talking about) random story I know, tbh I'm not ok, but I'm surviving like usual, actually I'm all just a bit Right and fine.
Ttyl
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, its 8 hrs to [redacted].
7 to [redacted].
not a big deal
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles an hour drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] i spose [redacted] or [redacted]'s wife ratted me out.
maybe i should block them too
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you and we can see how well that went.
[me] shiiiiiiiiit.
betrayal
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self gratification.
I was in a toxic rs for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our rs we were great.
One day both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
Im going to admit that sometimes when i feel jealous i just want her to reassure me like how i reassure her that its all good but she will only reassure me once and then said bye or ttyl.
Most of the time in an argument its always my fault, she wont admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight wont continue anymore
And I said “But yeah yeah you right.”
And he said “Ye well I gtg.
Im doing something” and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe.
When the convo started.
But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped.
Like what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doenst like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that.
If he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.
Idk what else to put Besides that i hate the current circumstance of life i live in im gonna give a little insight tomorrow Ok i lied i have to reveal my age tomorrow because if i dont Itll mess up the story Um Idk what to type so ill type a worry i have Umm i dont think ill get the tapegun intime Ok bye ttyl everyone
she said something like "but i want to make sure that we go as a friend?" thing and i was like "okay, i know" and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said "ofc i like my long time bf" yea, whatever right haha and here's my question... yesterday when i was at work, she msg me saying something like "how's your work doing" and i kinda reply her with cold tone saying "i'm at work ttyl" and then she kinda upset : "
Okay, i mean i understand you are at work so busy but u didn’t cut me off like this before so i kinda get it that you dont want to talk anymore like before.
got it!
bye!
How do you get destiny delicacies I've seen a few ppl have them but I've never got one idek where you get them if anyone knows it would be alot of help☺
and my machine f!@#ing freezes up it's been happening for like 2 days now... this machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3d scanner but 4 browser tabs on reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% OF MY DAMN MEMORY AND 60% of my cpu power and freezes the wholedamn thing up.
HEY! WAIT!
i've got a new complaint! ..... Seriously WTF are you devs doing???
stahp plz
If you think it's rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying "gotta go I'll talk to you later" then it's also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one off, things happen, maybe something came up and you got distracted etc.
But EVERY SINGLE PERSON ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It's really not that hard to just say "gotta go, i'll text you later" or "so and so just got home, TTYL" Even just "bye" or "BRB" or something!
Today i got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if i did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn't wanna ignore them just to talk to me, i said it wouldn't be a problem if he had just said something like "i can't talk rn" or "im with my friends ttyl" or just literally anything.
He then said i was overthink stuf and i should " chill out" so i left it at that.
So AITA and over thinking things?
AITA for gerring mad at my bf after he ignored me for a few days
So I would usually post this on r/keto but that sub is soooooo intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But like, a girl’s gotta rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
Have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, CALORIES PUHLEAZE”
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their no cheat days mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten free dairy free carb dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
Afaik, the concept of mini album is only around in kpop (maybe jpop?) I
m always dissapointed when a long awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5 songs album.
I can tolerate debut album since you really dont have a lot of material, but if youre snsd or something and you come out with mini after years long hiatus like mr mr, its kinda insulting.
idk what to say lol i'm pretty funny not only bc i manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often but also because i'm just fuckin hilarious tbh
i'm from yorkshire and that probably makes me cooler than you bc the north is just superior and i'm ready to die on this hill but ig we can be mates i would really like some of those ok i'm running out of people to laugh at my jokes
17m from the uk, pls be able to hold a conversation lol
Idek what kind of dog this was but it was so ugly my god who would own such a thing.
Dogs with wrinkles like pugs, char pays(idk how to spell it), bulldogs, boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all, I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally be told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness/ over nose-can’t breathe)
and yes I know I’m gonna get shit on my all the fuckin neck beards on reddit that just ADORE their snot nose little pug, idec I’m so tired of people and they’re dogs.
Everytime i listen to him sht makes so much sense, even tho i dont know what he is talking about, that leads me to belive that either that guy is a genius who can articulate whats going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something?
I mean what should i listen to if i rly wanna find out the truth if schiff is just "bias to Gold" and thats the reason why he is so hard on the current economy etc.
Do boobs=nice, coz idk never seen em before
then he check the oil level saying that the oil also smell like gasoline that gasoline and oil is mixing up together open one spark plug see the massive leak in there literally full up “let me say oil” smell like gasoline I didn’t smell that one that’s what the worker told me then he call his boss and the boss say is not gasoline is just oil “that shit smell like gasoline 🤦🏾‍♂️ even the worker confirm that I ain’t crazy but ayyy maybe I am and his worker” Told me he going to sealed the black thing that goes in top of the spark plug that covers it “sorry my English not that amazing” he said he was putting a sealed after draining the oil as he mentioned is oil drained the oil sealed the thing so oil don’t drip out of it and don’t drip to the floor but didn’t help me find the cause of why is oil getting into the spark plug because a sealed on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️ telling me if the problem keeps on is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way to much oil and is causing the oil leak that if the problems persist I will have to remove it Sorry for the long paragraph but need advices, need help tbh
My rabbit didn't eat or drink so I went to check him, its been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food idk.
(He has constipation so Imma check does he poop.)
How do I sleep if i have to check out my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is gonna become chaotic lol.
i assume the time has already passed for this but idk i figured i may as well ask, i kinda forgot i even had those tix until they announced they'd be touring again today
Now, my aunts (gma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated gma both before and after she passed.
When my gma first started getting sick, sis wasn’t the best bc she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but gma was also scared of covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job i couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back & forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
WIBTA if i didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So i mett this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dateing.
Last night everything was all right she was happy said good night anda ily like every night.
And the next morning when i texted her good morning she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad af all day because of me and but diden't want to say why.
Idk what i did.
I did nothing.
What should i do.
How can i contact her.
Should i give her space?
My gf blocked me and idk why
Mines ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in witch I have a F
, this is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I've done but are nowhere in the books, this kinda snuck up on me cause I thought they were done and filed only to check my grades and find out they weren't.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you at going say "ikr I only have a 89, why couldn't she round up, fml) Imma be honest that's not very helpful rn
so first off bard top what a pick ikr.
lets drop down my main build cause its the best assasin play style i like.
* my core is static/ie/RFC.
now i tried many ways and this is the best way i like to safely clear and lay out poke.
now under certain occasions like vs a garen id go what many would call shot gun bard swaping out static for runnans and if needed Rfc for pd. giving some more tank..
now as for the other two i actually leave them more optional picks in the ap department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain id pick up hextech gunblade this item is phenomenal on bard on hits are great.
if your already carrying hard id go something like lyiandries cause with the lead no one will catch you with this and the chunk is just bardo crazzzzyyyy.
yet two try gunblade and lyandries together but someday.
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years; we're both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It's driving me crazy, how to deal?
This wouldn’t be an issue if y’all servers ask in the beginning do u guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.
Also why restaurants have to be set up like that why u can’t just get up to the cashier and pay ur fucking share or food.
Hey guys bard main, just join reddit after finding out there are other off metta bards!
So i main him top, yes its scary but i do.
So i been getting alot questions about my builds from friends and happy on lookers lately!
thought i share my builds!
Im 16 years old 5'9.
I
m new to basketball and id like to ask for drills i can do by myself so i can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I dont have a decent shot nor a decent handle, i could barely reach the backboard plus i have no friends so dont even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why i wanted to be good at it so bad is because
i just want people to know me as somebody cuz right now im a nobody, i want to be SOMEBODY.
PS.
Ive never played an actual basketball ever in my life.. ikr?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising ykno) but p chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when i want to be), goofy, a lil chaotic, big overthinker kinda deal.
Enneagram type 4 bc apparently that matters (jk !!!)
Honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love ... you get the gist :)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist so a program with med school prerequisites would be preferable, plus, I plan to take my med school abroad (wow big dreams much?
I doubt I'd get in but it wouldn't hurt to try tho).
Academics aside
, the community is also important to me, I'd be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh and location too.
I'm short so if my classes are ~far~ I might as well roller skate my way through campus jk jk.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character. Or, ya know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would've prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do the player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now but I dont know if I want to pursue her its complicated.
Right now its summer break so imma wait til school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person cuz they dont talk to me online lol.
I dont know how long this series will go but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I dont know how long this is gonna take but probably quite awhile.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I dont have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say, that if youre a kid, like an elementary school kid and youre here, where the fuck are your parents???
Lol nvm fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
To any kids here, heres my advice: first off, drop out of school ASAP.
Its a fucking joke.
Also, run away from home asap and do a lot of hard drugs.
Meth kicks ass bro!
Try that first.
Also treat your teachers like shit and throw things at them.
Put tacs on their stools and shit.
Fuck all authourity.
ATAC.
Also beat up anybody who is mean to you.
Jk ;)
Cause I got them and no one to give them too lmao jk unless..........
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium sprite and a mcdouble?
So idk why o got on everyone nerves about the separate checks....
Hey, hi!!
Haha...
Im new here, didnt know this existed until now.
Iam exteremly shy and dont know what Im doing here typing this hahaha.
But hey, first time for everything right??
If we dont click and you lose interest then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry lmao.
I dont expect to get any messages but hey its worth a try.
Ps.
I dont know how to write these properly so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format omo
Oh and if I dont reply soon it might mean Im asleep or playing DnD hehe.
Nvm my internet is down rn fuck
Well I'm going to see if I can buy some stuff off steam now... let's hope there's still some good sales
Okay so I was a totl noob and earesed my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was gonna use but I sent monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
or how do you open the .key file
edit: nvm I'm a complete noob I figured it out.
Possible to retrive monero wallet seeds with .keyfile?

Comment So i can guess ur gender based on ur post history
Nvm..lemmee guess ur gender instead
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the prof is Oct.18.
*(edit. nvm, this part isn't true pls disregard).
*
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is Feb.9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the prof that I'm dropping the course, do I also have to get permission?
I'm planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits btw.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I rlly wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what!?” reallyyy loudddly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “nvm” cuz I felt like I was in the mf spotlight.
But every time, my nmom says that can't be true because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
"It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?"
Umm idk, maybe its bc we're DIFFERENT PEOPLE with DIFFERENT BODIES???
Tbh, have anyone ever experience fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn't die and manage to kill aleast one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch BUT rampage didn't pop his ult yet.
😲Wtf?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky af fighter, and a carry that solo everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.
I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, always.
Possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in.... oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
like now I feel guilty for smiling.
nvm the fake ones ish, but fuck.
haha.
ugh.
why am I still alive.
lol why tf does smiling hurt
Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME.
i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE.
HE SAYS "WHATS UP" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER.
I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS.
AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD.
IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING.
BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD.
I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS, THEN I LOOK BACK UP.
PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS.
Edit: yes I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen.
Useful, I know.
But URGHHHH.
They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
Btw there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: nvm.
I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance, oops now I'm not getting any mp!
Try to type in chat, "I will not cheat on this game!"
message repeats every time I hit enter.
WTF im not cheating.
anyways I type those words into the chat ( "I will not cheat on this game!") and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Wort way to tell a player to turn off Adblock but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player 10/10 never play again
EDIT: nvm, anytime I type in the chat the same shit happens
I'm gonna skip the oscar-bait shit like The Post because there's only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Dems making movies about how (Extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) "politics used to be moooorrreeee poollliitte we neeeeed a return to The Discouuurrrse."
I'm sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.
2mo ago I bought a cheap '95 nissan truck, I was only locally driving so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn't put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd **only** when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can't rev it past 3k in my driveway w/o feeling like I'm going to break something, I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it, it'll hit close-to 3500 right before gear-shifts) I was trying to methodically rule-out what could be causing this power-sap, IE is it the air/fuel or a clogged cat/exhaust/etc or something entirely different?
I ruled-out 'different', I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in Neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone elses nmom treat you like you're overreacting about your period pains?
Hey!
Read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangeroes, is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2mo boston terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside
friends think she said that cuz she was w her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up etc. others think its a way for her to be evil, like think of me cuz im never coming to get that charm.
i think its some type of hoover, good or bad.
any insight is appreciated.
if your a woman please tell me your perspective.
so confused, bt she is clearly w someone else and why she couldnt call me back and why she didnt respond to my txt msgs.
she couldve said im w my bf please dont call me bt she didnt.
Just a side note: my bf and i are buying a house.we
will be moving out in 2mo.
Once the papers are all finalzed.
I have an Australian shepherd 9mo.
My bf (24m) and i (25f) got her at 3 mo.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with a black lab and a dog small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a rat terrier.
Thier play style is boxing.
And one of my roomates (25m) has a beagle.
He doesnt like to play much infact he seems kinda scared too.
i know all of these things about my dog.
i know that it doesn't matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise; doesn't matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business; what matters is that my dog is nervous -- so when i hold my hand out and tell you, no, he's not sitting or lying down because he's calmly waiting for you to say hi, it's because he's nervous and insecure, i DON'T mean it as a joke, and it's NOT an invitation for you to say, "AW WELL MY DOG/CHILD IS VERY FRIENDLY SO LET ME APPROACH!"
i don't care if your dog/child is friendly or "dog savvy".
i don't care if your dog "is just a puppy" (why the hell is that even relevant? is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies? ??????).
i don't care if your child is capable of not screeching "OMG A PUPPYYYYYYY".
can you, y'know, DO something about your child? and also your dog?
But with less than 3mo to go for that i feel I'm not ready yet but having never taken it I have nothing to compare it to besides collegues advice.
Without knowing what I know they can't know if I'm actually ready yet but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this...bad...amd it would be awesome to be done 6 mo from my intro exam.
I'm close...
I just don't know if I'm 2mo study close.

(M/5'10"/26/165-195lbs) 2mo progress, gaining too much weight?
Passed my faa ppl written!!!
I know this sounds weird but heres my issue, about 4 months ago i had an 3700X which died after start crashing when i tried to play games and a day later not booting, send to rma, they confirmed the cpu was dead and gave my money back after 2mo, after that i got an 3800X, as soon as i tried got the boot code 7b everything power up but no reboots or video signal, send to rma this time with the store after 1mo they confirmed the cpu was falty send me a new one, i got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom(T) has always been the type where her feelings matter 1st + only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone elses fault entirely.
Ex: I needed some1 to babysit our then 2mo for 3-4 hrs.
Dads work had som1 who had COVID, we opted out of them watching our son + askd my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her *before* I set it all up b/c I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its *my fault* \+
she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her *days* after the incident b/c she didnt call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing, T promptly got off the phone, I nvr got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to Ts narcissism.
I dont expect an apology from T b/c she **nvr** has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
WIBTA for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5mo, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2mo he's co-sleot with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I've been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get 2mo baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (Currently replacing pacifier every hour) FTM to a sweet 2 month old girl and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.

So i already have an orange golden chinchilla ( toto - 2mo old) and we have had toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got terri (2 mo himalayan ragdoll) too keep eachother company.
Its only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor?
just always goin "bRRrrRRrrRRrr".
Im not sure if she has a blocked nose because toto, never made this kind of sound....
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?

How much do pelts sell for online???
Alright y’all.
I think I mis-tagged this earlier so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily w a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, & lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, **I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running** (I have no issue w being over 12+ ft from other ppl / usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually im quietly confident goin into these games but with injuries, players missing etc, im kinda happy if we get a draw.
I know they're utter pish and paper wise we should be wiping the floor with them but just not feelin the 2/3 nil vibe atm!
Anyone wanna talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
this is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait nvm shit meme.
i was 6 and playing lego rockband,i decided to ask for the buddy holly pack.

so thats how i got into weezer
I genually don't understand how "toxic" behavior is more pusished than literally int or troll.
Well I've had an account which always recieved those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until i got in a bad streak of losses in ranked and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior....
And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in game chat for toxic behvaiour after a report doesn't understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait till the morning but then I said nvm I just realized it’s almost 2 I’ll just wait and then he asked what would happen if I ate it rn and I said nothing it’s just too late now he’s telling me to just say fuck it and just eat the cereal so inspiring but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :(

I know your skin isn't perfect or you're insecure about your nose or looks.

It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You're beautiful because you're YOU Rant over actually nvm.

Can I get a rip in the chat boys, I was trying to go to sleep bc I couldn’t when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says bc she only said my name in all caps and then an nvm.
Fuck.
I just realized im complaining over a 5 minute fix..
Had never heard of this "influencer" before and consider myself pretty internet saavy.
I then lost interest in her bc her IG wasn't that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out and then I took a great interest in checking in on her bc I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while: How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her $$ bc she claims to not being able to afford food or rent or whatever when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers which aren't cheap.
I don't like him or anything but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my bf with him.

Then they turn the flashlight a lil too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they're screwed.
4. The f**k you splitting up for?!
There's always this one guy in horror movies that's like: Guys, there's a crazy a** killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed!
That's EXACTLY what the killer WANTS!
basically I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again cuz my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her) and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.

Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise,what with having an storyline that doesn come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as Over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and neccesary amount of seriousness and comedy, the characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert,Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events dont always have to rely on Neptune presence.

ive taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take NO MORE.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: meh, ok, thats fine.
They then use shit like A sub 1 through A sub 20 for variables.
infact, i have a linear algebra book that did this... A's FOR EVERYTHING.
the pages were just matrices filled with A's.
JUST DRAW A WEIRD SHAPE OR SOMETHING- ANYTHING BUT THAT ISH!

Well,well here we are again frustrated, angry in front of my phone what a neat way to start isnt it?All of ya readers are my theraphie and i dont ow you a cent perfect right?If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all cause of your short attention span so lets keep it short(what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying "keep it short im a genius ain't i?")Well a tryed explaining to my budds that porn is kinda shaby and yeah just bad and u know who listened.......
Hey,I just want to know what games can I run on this PC and witch nota.
I was a spy and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, mafia and sk had made their kills.
I proudly said: "I was attacked while in jail!", wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and ask me "You were attacked while you were in jail?" and I answer "yes m8".
He then tells me that what I am saying is bs because sk and maf have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously!?
Like I don't rly care what mean shit ppl on the internet say.
But when i got nobody IRL all I have is the internet and it do kinda hurt a bit when i just want to vent my problems.
And I'd be fine if it got maybe a single upv*te and no comments and I'd be fine.
But instead, it's full of people saying
Oh boi u 2 dum for da movie boi, da director wuz like shieeet itz bout da hiden meaningz u have 2 find boi, lyke u kno it duznt spoonfeed ya da film ya kno?
Like shieet y it gotta explain m8, just imagine what happened ya know?
It's no like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has ya kno?
yet when fully charged for the 1st 30-60 minutes, it's always on! which is beaaaautiful!
Lastly, if i do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping) the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off?
wtf m8?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone?
or is it just me?
in searching google i cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues i am really enjoying the mod.
its just a fuckin' ball ache every single time i want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before i can puff...
Everytime i log on i want to chill afk nmz and play xbox and be fat right but, lately i log on play rs afk for like 20secs and i get logged out and its fucking annoying is it my Internet connection or is it the servers or what its pissin me off m8
Next we have my Stats class and I didn't realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework and so my grade was a 70 something and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my Band class is basically easy A as it's show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert and so I passed that gg ez m8.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do NOT go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like "wtf m8?" and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there, did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This years rookie game is actually going to be real exciting, wt line ups u wanna see

But now it just doesnt make sence, you only get 1 ticket per match and if you are lucky you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.

My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No.
Fking.
Competition.
Most men this day are thirsty af.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs.
And i mean that literally.
BUT – thats good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.

Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that, she probably already have one also.
A real digital movie camera cost sooo damn much.
So I opted for an analogic one.

But then how does it work?

VACUUM WONT STOP SUCKING PLEASE SEND HELP, IS IT GONNA BLOW?
Basically if you didn’t know what that is,it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Lets eat granny” making it seem like someone’s gonna eat their nan.
However,the other example says “Lets eat,granny” implying a different meaning to the sentence.
Pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas ig.

‘I did what I could with what we have available here.’
Despite his stern demeanour, Skraivok was eager, infused with energy, in marked contrast to the dour warrior who stood guard at his back.
The Tyrant struggled to his feet then, swaying unsteadily over the throne and supporting himself with switch-thin arms.

Perhaps a hundred metres of clear air separated the Lux Ferem from the ground.
‘I could feel your existence, of course,’ Omegon said to me.
He spoke the words with the same inflection as Kor Phaeron, perfectly mimicking the emphasis the priest placed upon them.
Or did Akurduana read too much into a mere reflection of the light?
Amid the squares of soldiers awaiting inspection by Dammekos, three dozen war machines of Perturabo’s own design idled their engines.
Shamefully, he stopped shooting, waiting for Zankator or Fan to finish the deed for him.
‘Steady now, keep the advance!’ bellowed Mago, his spear never ceasing.
In this regard, our Legion is the foremost of all in trustworthiness.
Faster than eyes could track, Mago had the blade of his spear at Ohna’s throat.
‘We need to get them moving faster,’ said Ahriman’s armoured companion on the other side of the street.
‘Where did that strike come from?’ demanded Russ, striding to the edge of the command platform, unwilling to believe the evidence of his senses.
His skills, already potent, had been further honed by Tesserius Akurduana, a warrior reckoned the finest swordsman in the Legion.
Did he truly believe the brightest minds of the Thousand Sons had not already debated this thought experiment a hundred times over?
‘Perhaps were it not for the machinations of the Achaens, we would not be in this woeful situation!’ retorted Didimus.
But always he had attested to the plans of the Powers and how they acted through him.
‘I can try, lord,’ Gukul replied grimly, which was all the information I needed.
‘It was to demonstrate my Legion’s prowess, and by reflection my prowess.’
I had purchased it from a manufacturer of such goods not far from Winnika’s depot, then cut it down to size.
‘The problem with that,’ as Russ had once explained to his brother Vulkan, ‘is that we like being angry.
The glory of the Truth does not die today on some unmarked field of sand and dirt!
The immense armature of his Cataphractii plate glittered with trembling droplets of condensed vapour.
Lion El’Jonson was a mighty general, and he would want to assess this new development in the Great Crusade as soon as possible.
Nairo saw several parchments covered in the neat cuneiform he knew to be Lorgar’s script.
The patricians might have accepted Corynth as regent, but they would never accept an elected body of malcontents.
They were of the Kushtun Naganda regiments, and might have fought alongside my father, or at least in the same conflicts He had.
‘You cannot live your life alone, my son,’ said Dammekos sadly.
‘You have given him the authority to run all of Vharadesh in your absence.’
The Night Lords had another name for the planet, bestowed with a Nostraman flair for poetry, and that was the Carrion World.
Although I had felt kinship of a sort when I had laid eyes on those found so far – all without their knowledge – I had not yet discovered the one whose soul I could feel was bonded to my own.
Unlike the human woman’s, Aravain’s vocal cords were scarcely perturbed by the gunship’s vibrations.
What did keep his attention was the stone around him – it was old, terrifyingly old, sunk into the bedrock long before the spires and domes that now formed the outer profile of the Palace were built.
Nairo could see the glint of weapons – spears for the most part, nothing advanced – but the arrangement of the Declined suggested curiosity more than hostility.
Other Legions, I believe, view it as offensive that my Legion take on not just my appearance when dealing with outsiders, but also my name.
His armour was covered in reddish stains, and Fulgrim wondered whether the wounded had appreciated the attentions of the Apothecary, or whether they’d have preferred the ministrations of the merely human.
‘Now is the time, Leman of the Russ,’ the Wanderer said, in the voice that was both young and old, masculine and feminine, always soft, suffused with a patina of epochal sadness.
‘We are captains of the Twenty-second, and we will prove what that means.’
Jorin didn’t reflect on that as he entered the crew bay of the Haukr, some hundred metres below the command bridge.
The stippled, Dark Age ruins of the islands’ fortifications had been extended with the harsh features of gothic architecture.
I am better than you because I saw that clearly, without your naivety.’
Some innate ability, psychic in nature, Corax surmised, blocked out his presence from the minds of humans and most xenos.
Their looks of fear and the reactions of his sons cleared Perturabo’s mind.

The warp currents are smooth, and I can see no impending problems.’
He had learned the war-rhythms from the Sulpha in his youth.
Now he stood, alone, in the presence of the Lord of Winter and War.
He dug his fingers into the earth, drawing out a handful of Ghenna’s dark soil.
‘Prospero is a place of… mixed emotion for me,’ said Ahriman, startling himself with his need for honesty.
Yet secrecy is of the utmost importance, I hope you will understand.
Thus, he had done his best to quash all hint of wrongdoing on Fabius’ part.
The Khan drew in a long breath, pulling the cold air of Chogoris deep into his lungs.
‘The Fourth and Fifteenth Legion fleets comprise enough civilian craft to accommodate between forty and sixty thousand evacuees per vessel.
‘They are the leaders of the Great Crusade, crafted from the Emperor’s own genetic stock to embody a different facet of his personality and the demands of war.
Night Haunter was unworried; no infection could harm him, he knew this instinctively as he knew so many other things.
Perturabo had the Cavea Ferrum installed beneath the smoking ruins of Kardis, his labyrinthine lair of iron halls and subtle energy fields that could misdirect any intruder.
‘You wish to expunge all evidence of our faith from the Legion?’
I panted from the exertion, but I was still not done.
This was true as well, since I had not sought consent from either of them.
The intensity of my expression was so great that they both quailed before me, and I forced myself to relax.
He glowered at the screens as Legion markers poured through the capitolis walls.
We did not know what wounds or illnesses the refugees might have suffered before arriving here, and it was already obvious that, at this stage at least, the infrastructure of Volda Beta was not capable of meeting their needs.
My father had greeted my rediscovery with wonder; Malcador, with intrigue and some satisfaction.
‘I have acquired a new world for the Imperium, at minimal cost, and a new source for potential aspirants for my Legion.
‘That is kind of the idea,’ said Skraivok, again to great approval.
‘It is no comfort that he will die a slow death instead,’ moaned Axata.
Bucepholos may have been behind one or more of the recent attempts on Pandion’s life.
‘Perhaps,’ said Ashkali, bending to draw a circle in the dust with her fingertip.
Any trace of the amusement Angron had expressed moments before had vanished.
‘You can always come to me, you know this?’ said Russ.
‘It seems that the Third Legion has much to teach us.’
‘I am sure the Emperor has His own ideas on ruling the galaxy fairly,’ said Corax.
He carried a naked dao blade, as long as a man’s height, engraved with ancient Khorchin battle-curses.
With an effort that almost made him black out again, Vaughn turned his eyes to the right and saw the first captain.
This simple fact made them more fervent followers, with the vigour of those whose existence now depended upon the Truth of the Word to give their lives meaning.
She had fought so long for the XVIII Legion, and had been through so many desperate struggles, that she had a taste for the last stand too.
As far as the Sak’trada Deeps were concerned, miserable Gholghis was a paradise.
We have determined, through our study of the signal it was broadcasting as well as their anatomy, that the Ghennans are not merely autonomous machines masquerading as humanity.
‘If you cannot accept simple instruction I will not waste my time with you.
You are to relinquish command immediately to your lieutenants and report to me aboard the Iron Blood.’
I never got the impression He understood such things, but then again it is dangerously easy to underestimate Him.’
You think He’s too close and driven by plans He does not divulge.
In a xenos enemy, Jorin might have respected the continued defiance, for it was natural instinct for any organism to defend its own, but there could be no respect for the Tyrant of Dulan’s armies.
Even when she did manage to approach one they would tell her almost nothing; sometimes even getting their name and rank felt like prising the darkest secret in the Imperium from its sworn protectors.
The Khan reached for a goblet and poured himself a drink.
‘Witness the Truth from my lips and remember the name of Kor Phaeron!’
Though his attention was elsewhere, Kor Phaeron did not think he was listening to the universal music that filled his thoughts.
This, however, was fleet warfare, and the xenos had no chance against the precision strikes and group tactics of my Legion.
He was fighting the Elemental of Karaashi through a maze of ice.
Perturabo and a dozen of his warriors watched from his elevated workshop, and Magnus winced as he climbed the steps to meet his brother.
‘Theoretical – if this fortress and its tunnels are what the culture of Thoas became, then this was a civilisation devoted entirely to war.
‘Yes,’ I replied through gritted teeth, rising back to my feet.
Against all effort to remain aloof and scholarly, a teacher not a parent, Kor Phaeron could not restrain the growing paternal instincts that Lorgar aroused in him.
A full company of legionaries joined Vulkan on the roof of the hull.
By their position, Forrix knew the cities, but his brain was numbed by the slaughter, and when he tried to recall their names they swam away from his mind, like fish evading capture.
‘I fear that I will be forced to draw this blade in anger.
She reassembled the Aegypta’s navy, using it to re-establish their old empire, and launched military campaigns against the nations who had once been their oppressors.’
‘The Wolves razed my world and burned our knowledge to ash!
They celebrated the XVIII Legion and the history of the device.
‘And I am guilty, just as you are,’ the Lion urged again, his grip on the sword tight.
The workings of a Hydra were no mystery to Forrix; an Iron Warrior could operate any artillery piece in the Imperial armoury.
The voice in the chamber only spoke his own fears aloud, he knew that; he knew it wasn’t the Emperor, as much as he knew it was.
Each of the gladiators is an abhuman giant, equal to Angron in size.
The XII Legion phalanx was a devastating force on any battlefield, often imitated but never bested.
We can discuss the war, and we can join our forces to combine their strengths, just as our father intended when He made us all so… different.
He couldn’t know for sure that every Morningstar soldier was hostile, but the Iron Warriors operated a zero-uncertainty policy within their perimeters.
Of all the blazes Kor Phaeron had witnessed of late, this was the crowning moment.
Delicate scrollwork marked the flat panes of ceramite, depicting scenes from Chemos’ history.
‘You thought the end of the waiting would be the end of doubts,’ Vulkan said, as he joined Rhy’tan.
‘Malcador tells me you have made significant progress with your studies,’ He said, as we left my quarters and began to walk through the Imperial Palace.
Do not take my levity to heart – I wish this to succeed.
Their return to Gardinaal Prime would see the institutes of Human Resourcing ensure that their stripped flesh and ground bones provided one final service to the state.
The fires consuming Malkoya, though, were still raging when word reached Angron from the fleet in orbit.
Upon these walls were battle companies of Iron Warriors, who now patrolled as if the city were an embattled outpost.
Under magnification, they were marvellous landscapes of the worlds Agapito had visited in his career, forty-nine thus far.
Unfortunately Kor Phaeron had never seen the original text on which the book remarked, but he had inferred much of Dammas Dar’s observations nonetheless.
By the time legionaries of the First Chapter arrived with Marius Gage, there was nothing left to kill.
‘I wonder how many ships called Terra’s Glory there are in the galaxy?’ mused Autilon Skorr.
‘Do you think,’ Russ said, mulling the matter over in his mind, ‘that Malcador knew we would meet here?’
And you are sure enough of your position to stand before me and tell me that you will not do what I ask?’
But I trusted too much to human nature, as you made me to, as the universe dictated I do.
Solemnly, Curze passed into his arming chambers, where sombre, tongueless slaves awaited him.
The tallest spires of Zharrukin swayed and groaned, the re­inforcement within the stone tearing as alternating fields of powerful magnetics twisted them.
The men destroying his Legion from within were either confident they would not be discovered, or were so proud of their actions they felt they had nothing to hide.
It was peaceful here, in contrast to the rest of Byzas.
But I know well enough that, for all our glory, we are but a backwater province of a far greater kingdom.
‘Do you believe that even the First Expedition Fleet never suffers a casualty?’
‘You say “hosts” but what you mean is the population of Muspel.’
But to craft an image rather than simply recreate one, it is…’ His face contorted in an agony of frustration.
He needed to stop Alkenex and Quin before they depopulated the entire barracks.
On Chemos, he had been forced to navigate spheres of influence, as he slowly worked to break down and rebuild the old executive clan system.
If he kept talking, he might give me information I would not have thought to ask about.
He looked expectant at this witticism, and expected Kiner to share the joke.
As he walked, he sent a second command, this time directed at the Legion garrison commanders rather than the ship-crews.
The chatter died down a little and Vashti walked to the edge of the command centre, peering down onto the platforms through the vibrating armourglass.
Of the one hundred and fifty-five legionaries under Santar’s command, only sixty were with him now.
‘And it is the same in the other two warehouses?’ asked Caius.
Two masked men in golden robes, with an Imperial Army-issue rocket launcher primed and ready to fire.
‘But you waited until I was here to see you do it.
If such disasters were not bad enough, Mechanicum theorists predicted an ultra-rapid erosion of Morningstar’s atmosphere, resulting in lethal exposure levels of stellar radiation.
But I also know I was placed here for a reason, and you must know that I intend to carry out my duty.
‘What do they say, brother?’ said Farith Redloss, nodding towards the slate in Duriel’s hand.
‘They have no conception of the enemies we have overcome,’ said Corax.
Let me hear in your march the beat of the great hammer of the Eighteenth Legion.
But even now, with the Great Crusade having uncovered so much of that ancient knowledge, ignorance of the galaxy’s far expanses was near complete, with only rare oases of light, such as Ultramar or Terra, to break the remorseless dark.
He would see the Dark Angel broken on the dust before the sunset, for now he understood the ritual, and what it meant, and why it had to continue.
Nairo bowed his head in supplication while Hu Osys fell to her knees, forehead pressed to the flaking grey paint on the metal floor.
‘I can draw down fire from heaven and scorch your cities to glass, if I wish.
He could only see with the eyes of a member of the old order on Macragge.
‘What happened to the man I knew who wished for no more war?
She wore deep green robes and bore the stylised I-icon of the Imperium atop a long metal staff.
This pointless, ruinous campaign was the fault of the Emperor’s vanity.
He closed his eye, letting his mind absorb Shai-Tan’s pain, reliving it over and over through the memories of all those who had suffered here.
The Golden One was not seeing anything in the physical realm, nor paying heed to the mortals who passed him, or the lick of the flames creeping closer and closer.
And if he had drawn anything from his interrogation of Moses Trurakk, and from his present company, then it was that the Imperials were profoundly intolerant of weakness.
His manner was so hypnotic Kiner saw the place in a new and glorious light.
On the sixth Coldfall after Lorgar’s discovery Kor Phaeron consulted the heavenly messengers and asked them to provide guidance.
‘I agree when you say you’re not an enforcer,’ said Tensat.
The request was made quietly, but it entered Kor Phaeron’s thoughts with the same weight as the commands of the Powers themselves.
Pride and duty held him here, not dedication to the welfare of the Imperium as a whole.
He lost a few seconds, because Xerexenia was suddenly leaning over him, when she had been standing before her console, a few metres away, the moment before.
‘Then we should look for answers in the ruins,’ Guilliman said.
For a moment, I thought we had an understanding – that we had showed him what could be done – but then he pulled away.
The Khan looked sceptical, studying Magnus for a long time, probing for some subterfuge or dissemblance.
The orks were caught now between Iasus’ formation, Guilliman and Hierax’s company.
The idea is worth exploring, and I am sure you would do a fine job,’ said Guilliman.
She tucked the paper into the breast pocket of her coat and looked up at Amar.
For the first time Elver could recall, the captain seemed cautious, even frightened.
As they moved through the tents and caravans and into the city proper, Nairo was shocked by what he saw.
The upper hundred metres of the tower exploded, as if an Elemental had just been born within.
The trio of Stormbirds had landed on a massive, flat stone dais, many hundreds of metres across.
‘I saw it,’ whispered Tethys, the low rasp of collapsed lungs.
The echo of the Emperor’s words sent a shiver of dark prescience through Magnus.
The belly of the Lux Ferem was a hundred metres above them.
In a few seconds the blind cloud had enveloped the construct, the plasterbag stockade and the Ultramarines; even the wail of the tocsins became muted.
For a moment, Dantioch thought that Perturabo would strike him dead there and then.
‘Have you wondered why a pre-Imperial human planet did not have one already?’
It was rendered deliberately small, partly for reasons of space, partly so that Corax might stare down at it from imperious heights.
‘I shall bring a new creed, the Truth of the One.’
It was all the momentum of the Termite, its monstrous totality – just as it was not the hammer itself that would crush an enemy, but the force of the blow.
‘My time is limited, but while I draw breath, I will stay and provide a welcome for any of the xenos who come here in search of us.’
‘There is a term in the Augean dialect of the Ionic Plateau – anabasis.
I opened my mouth to order Everedd to withdraw, but something held me.
‘We do not truly understand the warp,’ Omegon continued, ‘but it is not like the material universe in any way.’
Let the Truth be your strength, and whatever becomes of this world know that your faith will prevail.
Kor Phaeron considered dismissing the question but he could see that the matter would nag at the captain, and through him would infect the thoughts of the other converts.
They raced towards their targets, but at the last second, Ahriman twisted their course and turned them back upon their source.
‘What…’ The old man looks between the becalmed Jochura and Angron.
He had fallen almost eighty years before Aravain’s ascension to the Legion.
He had fought alongside the sons of three Legions in his time, and the thought that they might be to blame for the current predicament, even unknowing, was anathema.
Not the battles since, but those on Fenris I never forget.
There’s more than a few people believe that the Mechanicum is responsible for their misery.’
Whether through instinct or some brutish version of strategy, the orks were tracking the Termite with greater accuracy now.
His was a false smile; sometimes Perturabo regretted Harkor’s elevation to the Trident.
Ilthen’s ruby eye lenses danced with the reflected light of hundreds of detonations blooming across the cloudy orb of Nostramo.
A migration was building, almost certainly a reaction to the Iron Warriors’ presence in the sector.
‘I will see you rise again, Cassian Vaughn, your strength the equal of your will.’
The man turned round so fast Elver didn’t have time to blink.
The Legion was courting one disaster in order to avert a greater one.
The 125th Expeditionary Fleet was scattered across at least one astronomical unit of space or more.
‘Justice is hard and cruel and I am hard and cruel!’ he snarled accusingly at the figure.
He thought about Ranknar, and how close the war to bring that world into compliance had come to becoming a war of extermination.
Take me there – I need to fill my lungs with purer air.’
‘You at least, Camen Manek, are blessed with a little brain,’ Curze said.
‘I had always assumed it was the soul of the one who made me, but now I see my error.’
Even with such a warning in our ears, even having seen many strange and vile things in my time amongst the stars, I was not prepared for what rounded the corner.
The army units in the western provinces and the agri-circle will put pressure on Bucepholos, forcing him to meet with the Sabazians, or risk fighting a war on two fronts.
He took a sip from the cup and passed it to Kor Phaeron, who allowed only enough liquid to moisten his lips.
They left the rest of the tens of thousands of Lorgar’s converts behind, to make camp away from sight of the city and its defenders.
Curze could hear Elver’s heart from the other end of the vessel.
He would use Sirras’ foolishness to reach his goal much sooner than would have been possible until now.
Sometimes, he would spend time with Elver, and instruct him in various matters.
‘And such things are impossible, or so our Father told me.’
If the clerk noticed the croak in Grymn’s voice then he was too harried to remark on it.
Duriel glanced at the prostrate form of the previous governor, then at the Lion.
The Wanderer turned, looking out into the highlands of Asaheim, where the peaks marched under a crystal sky, eternal and inviolate.
You will be taken from here and judged for your crimes, but your world will be received into the Imperium, its people preserved.’
It had slender lines, as proportionate as everything constructed by the Blood Angels artificers, though also as heavily armed.
‘What could be down there that is of interest to the primarch?’ asked Astakos.
Corax thought of Sanguinius and Angron, Dorn and Guilliman, The Khan and the Wolf.
Again Axata showed his understanding but betrayed further thought with his disturbed expression.
Whether that lay in the artifice of the Emperor or the being of the Lion was unclear.
Slowly, Angron looked back at Khârn, the absence of light doing nothing to dispel the intensity of his yellowed, glaring eyes.
Half the corporal’s men had already left to delay the Imperial attack on the district power plant.
Morningstar had been settled early in the golden age of exploration, and Zharrukin was one of its earliest cities.
Autilon Skorr had his own features, as did Dercius and Sheed Ranko; but Eltan, Hymor, Jha-Tena, Ingo Pech, Silonius Kel and Thias Herzog all wore mirrors of my own face, or as near as made no difference.
Like his Legion, they sought to attain a perfect state of grace.
He could see his words sinking into the mind of Lorgar, and pushed home his message.
‘We embarked on this endeavour to save the Emperor’s realm, not to watch it die.’
The Dark Angels would assume that was a difference between us, and they would be mistaken.
He had sought out the Forgemaster in his quarters, where T’kell had been preparing for embarkation, and told him that he would be the pilot of the great engine.
The orks had managed to hold the Spear of Fire in the hall long enough to bring their weapons to bear.
Six hours they had taken to reach the bastion’s inner command coil, two more to destroy the residual Scarabine suicide guard units, and then another two to sequence the plasma charges before lifting out.
He’d heard similar sounds often enough on Chemos as a child.
Clearly his sense of secrets buried in Zharrukin had been correct, but what danger had he sent his sons into?
‘I heard all of your chatter as you approached the camp, and everything that has been said since I came aboard.
The door slammed in Nairo’s face a moment before he heard a muffled low moaning, swiftly followed by indistinct words of comfort from Kor Phaeron.
It was always hot in those armour sets, Caius remembered well from his days as a line officer, even though they had inbuilt cooling systems.
The situation did not please Och’hi, but it did not surprise him.
It fell back to Morningstar with infinite grace, but Forrix knew that something of such titanic mass would cause untold devastation upon impact.
One of the Space Marines who had saved Dantioch staggered back into the line.
‘He will bring doom on Lochos!’ said the priest, directly to the crowd.
Though they were invisible to other human eyes, Corax could see his twelve warriors ranging high and far through the recycling plant’s structure.
My lord, one of my sergeants, Zolan, insisted that I should consider withdrawal.
Although I now lacked a pauldron and half my chestplate, the communications functions were still working properly.
They claim they are our protectors, but I tell you they are daemons given human faces!
That single statement soured the mood more than all the artillery of the III Legion ever could.
He was the Eighth Assault Company captain, the equerry, the eyes and ears of the primarch.
The Wolf King boasted to all that he was his father’s executioner.
But when Guilliman arrived, he shamed Corax for his harsh judgment.
The sensible ones noticed quickly that the Space Marines were not firing, and took shelter in the nests of seats.
‘All I see is dust and smoke, and my eyes are far keener than yours.’
Either his brain was more cunningly engineered than even a high consul of the Gardinaal could comprehend or he genuinely did not know.
The Khan ran his hand over his face, rubbing at the scar that ran down his left cheek.
Ove-Thost caught a glimpse of three rows of teeth, then a blast of foul breath and a splatter of yellow saliva.
Of the ten commanders of the first ten Millennials of the Legion, he was perhaps the most thoughtful.
‘Explain your analysis,’ Iasus said, more out of necessity than interest.
The memory of the fight with the Cadere curdles and deforms, yet Tethys feels every sensation experienced by his father that day.
The greater part of those garrisons was made up of the Auxilia regiments, though most had a skeleton Legion presence and access to rapid-response networks.
My enemy is in our very blood and bone, and strikes where I least suspect, at every turn.’
A whole Legion of Space Marines dedicated to the prosecution of the Powers’ goals, nestled in the heart of the Imperium’s efforts to conquer the galaxy.
If the day ever comes, I will not be astonished at it.’
Against this background of fear, Elver attempted to do his duties as best he could until, in the end, terror became mundane.
‘It has been near a year and a half since I departed these walls.
‘Cut me,’ he commanded her, ‘and release Perturabo’s blood, for my name is Perturabo.’
‘I am saying I do not need you to explain the craft of war to me,’ said Pexx, punctuating his words with shots from his volkites.
Next to him, Aladas gave him a pointed look, her eyes filled with doubt.
His knees almost buckled, but with the help of the Land Raider behind him, they held.
Smooth warp currents or otherwise, Arachmus was best off concentrating on his role rather than speaking with me.
‘From the earliest days, before I understood anything but the Altak, I always knew where the threat lay, and how to counter it.’
It was as if the Imperium were governed by the two faces of a single man – one preternaturally healthy, the other irredeemably sick.
We will bring him before the Emperor, but we must do it ourselves.’
It began to float towards me, but I ignored it for now in favour of the other warrior, which was already scuttling sideways to get a better line of fire.
Barely functional was the expression that leapt to Vashti’s mind when she first saw her new working environment.
His former captain, Garr of Order Quarii, had, to the relief of all, bellowed the news into the Hall.
Fuggy heat hit a moist slap of sweat about Caius’ face.
Kasperos Telmar and Grythan Thorn paced to either side of him, alert for any threat.
To see someone as vital, so physically imposing as Lorgar in pain was dreadful.
‘When I was younger I used to have so much fun.
‘As I understand it this planet will fall in a week or two.
‘The Emperor Thutmose the Third did not have his Dark Angels.’
They failed to heed the call to join the Imperium, and so it was a forced compliance.
It took us four hours to reach the outskirts of Hydana, but here our pace had to slow once more, for now we were at greater risk of discovery.
Vel-Kheredar would wring every scrap of knowledge from here, and then he would burn it to the ground.
He recognised her as Enith Forsault, a recruit from the more recent intake, but a promising one.
Ultimately, though, it was Guilliman’s distaste for what the Destroyers were and did that held them at bay.
‘If I spoke in here now, it would be a lie.’
Fan Morgai, leader of the tribe, gathered his family to a brief council.
I thought my crews were good, but I believe yours could school them.’
Fenc stared at polished, chequerboard tiles, but he imagined Corax surveying the kneeling men.
When I look at this painting, I am reminded again of why I insist upon perfection in every aspect of my Legion’s conduct in battle.
Belleros Corynth, on the other hand, was a man of the people.
Whereas the Emperor’s knowledge and mastery of all seems an innate part of Him, Malcador gives the impression of someone who has come by his wisdom through long study.
Shield flares enveloped the morbid machine, but DuCaine could not tell if it had been damaged.
‘Captain, I would cast this cargo out into the void, and forget you ever saw it.
I have slain thousands in the name of the Imperium, but these feelings, my lord…’ He swallowed.
Nairo had eyes only for the master – not out of any loyalty to Kor Phaeron, for he was a despicable man, but for fear of his own future.
All the Iron Warriors’ logistical expertise was required to reform their battlegroup, but slowly the fleet regathered, and such repairs as could be made without orbital facilities were begun.
In all the years since his elevation into the Legion, all the wars, he had known loss and defeat.
It served your brothers who are now on Antaeum, and you have served it by remaking it stronger.
Then he would order the next attack, knowing that he was set upon a course and to abandon his plan now would render every­thing undone, a failure to the One and the millions who now looked to him for spiritual guidance and leadership.
If Fulgrim was the phoenix, then the Emperor was the fire that bestowed renewal.
There were no measurable communications between the xenos worlds, nothing to indicate that they shared information at all, but shortly after the use of the temporal bomb on Gugann, the hrud had begun to move en masse.
‘I wish I had more time to know you, Forrix,’ said Ahriman.
At the time of its departure for the Taras Division the XVIII had only one battleship.
He hadn’t been able to relay a message to Anastana and his sons in six months.
The Lion pinned him beneath the weight of his regard a moment longer before releasing him.
Sevatar glanced up to see the primarch’s eyelids flutter, and take an unsteady step back, signs the First Captain knew only too well.
‘Might I formally request that you choose another in my place?’

‘You are going to die,’ said Aravain, the taste of coagulated blood in his mouth, ‘in the manner of every tyrannical xenoform that stood in the path of humanity before you.’
Sometimes I wonder if Jaghatai views the Imperium more as a means to get him to the stars than anything else, but that is of little concern.
‘I swear by the almighty Powers that… I shall dedicate my life to learning the Word and the Truth, and to serve the Powers as they see fit to guide me.

‘I am the intermediary of Galithium Vo-Phoex, creator of this vessel.’
If you will excuse me, I have other duties to perform.’
Even among all the great works of architecture, mathematics and science that lay in ashes around him, this loss struck Magnus deeply.
Many of the routes were blocked by rockfall, and Tarchus’ squad had to double back or choose alternative routes so many times that it became impossible to plan a systematic reconnaissance of the ruins.
If Corax had violent intentions towards Curze and made the first move, then he’d definitely die.
‘The truth, as one of Terran descent would say, is that such men are seldom given choices.

Though he could only hear two words out of every three, it was obvious that the argument was not turning in Kor Phaeron’s favour.
Several of my brothers – Ferrus, Mortarion, Perturabo, even Russ – would have taken the enemy’s strength as a challenge, and met it head-on.
The Apothecary had striven against impossible odds for so long that all he could see was the fight.

I have watched Sanguinius soar and have wished, for a moment, that I possessed his wings.
Few can comprehend time as I do – it is the very engine of the universe.’
As it had been with Bjell, it was a bad way to die.
Yesugei and the Khan left the chamber after that, escorting Horus back to his shuttlecraft from where he would go on to command the entire network of expeditionary fleets.
In the week since Bucepholos’ failed coup, the renegade patricians had either surrendered or retreated into the hinterlands.
By fortunate happenstance, Magnus and his Thousand Sons were traversing the outer edges of the system and offered their assistance.

The legion­aries of Terra are my sons as much as the legionaries of Nocturne.

Fenc had a sense Corax found it hard to engage sympathetically with enemies who thought differently.
I was moving before the ruined corpse of my Headhunter had hit the ground.
From the centre of the shield wall, Mago drove his spear forward and back, forward and back, in union with his ­veteran front-rankers.
Such was the monumental scale of man’s continually expanding dominion that such a length of time had passed before the Throneworld had taken notice.
That had not kept him from persisting at it long after his stubbornness had driven half of the III Legion to despair.
Qin Xa remained on the flagship, as was his duty, as did Yesugei after dividing the Legion’s zadyin arga between the various divisions.
I was not immune to the excitement myself, even though I already knew what was being discussed.
‘I know that, but if we are reckless we risk losing everything this ship may teach us of Morningstar’s past.’
Working in silence, the servitors quickly sheared Iocare’s head to the scalp and marked points of incision across his skull, all under the careful supervision of the Librarian’s specialised kin.
Chronologically, the boy was probably some years older than the Night Haunter, but he was young, very young.

I show the tech-guilds mercy, I will show you mercy also.
Several main criteria dictated their selection – the procession of their orbits relative to the other Thousand Moons; the weight of fire their guns could bring to bear in combination with their neighbours on eight key quadrants; the strength of their defences – those of medium potency were selected first, being suitable demonstrations of the Raven Guard’s power without posing too large a danger to the forward insertion teams; the size of their populations; and, finally, the intransigence of their rulers.

Raptora energies warped the metal of the Hydra like softened wax.
‘We must preach the Word of the One, and the Truth will return to Colchis.’

Sixty thousand soldiers of the Imperial Army are a day’s warp travel behind me.
The Emperor stood there before him, sublime, burning sword held out in challenge, and Ferrus knew.
I had every confidence that my Legion would surpass the Lion’s expectations, and more than hold their own.
The lengths He went to, and what He willed us to do for Him to achieve unification.
The honeyed words of the Ghennans flickered through his memory, spoken in that bizarre, shared chorus.
According to Dantioch, unlike the ones we faced here, those hrud he encountered fought only if confronted, at least until the last days when they appeared in greater numbers.
They spoke to Angron’s mind in a chorus of their voices, with the warmth of new light spilling over the land at sunrise.
Phoros, Iskia, Vren and Achos fell in quick succession on the first two days.
I felt no guilt, merely gratitude, even though I quite possibly owed Gukul my life.

‘I’ve seen it before – secret societies were rife on Chemos in my youth.
In contrast to the rest of the prow, which was crammed with lance batteries, torpedo tubes and all the many systems that made them function, the open space of the Mason’s Hall seemed an indulgence, but it too had a purpose.
Even at first glance, Guilliman could easily imagine how this creation had come to pass.
He opened his eyes, but saw only the darkness of the sunshade for a few heartbeats before the scarf-shrouded, weathered faces of the Declined intruded upon his view, concern in their dark eyes.
Ani nodded and opened the door of their cupboard to wrap Seddy in her bedroll, then quietly shut the door again.
‘I curse that I know not when the Lion truly died,’ he murmured.
The Callax worker protests had shown him the consequences of disorder.
Chapter Master Iasus and some elements of his force have survived.’
‘Do you think,’ Agapito asked, as he poured out the contents of a small aluminium flask into two mugs, ‘that it is going to work?’
‘If not in the grand library, he is among his people spreading the True Word.’
There is no ban in the Legions on the use of these weapons.’

The jarl of Dekk-Tra had a face seemingly carved from wind-blasted bedrock, long and lean and riven with scars.
In Quin’s opinion, there was little to mark the natives of Chemos out as suitable warriors.
Magnus had not considered the idea of his act becoming widely known, but with troublesome rumours already circulating the crusading expeditionary fleets, perhaps a story to reinforce the positive aspects of the Thousand Sons’ abilities would be no bad thing.
Ahriman reached deep inside himself and used his Pavoni arts to blunt Forrix’s pain.
‘The Emperor desires Gardinaal to be taken intact,’ the warrior added unasked, filling the silence.
Where were they when Angron had called, and none save Iocare had answered?
The heat of a thousand confined bodies generated a steady wind that buffeted Caius as he approached the doorway.

‘But nor can I simply leave the tens of thousands of people aboard the Lux Ferem and in Calaena to their doom.’
The fourth – some sort of minor official, Elver thought – travelled alone.
He had gone from a warrior of the Nan, to a warrior of the Khitan, to a warrior of the ordu of Jaghatai.
And, more than that, Ahriman suspected he and Forrix were becoming friends, which had surprised him, until he thought of Magnus and Perturabo’s friendship.
‘Lord Commander Cicerus reported a large air defence force of capable atmospheric fighters.’
‘He has dwelt among us here at Lochos now for ten years, and although his birth date remains as mysterious to us as so much about him, we reckon it is now his sixteenth birthday, on this, the anniversary of his coming to us.

‘We showed this place to you for a reason, Phoenician,’ the masked figure continued.
The admiral imagined his opposite numbers on the Carinaean warships staring at similar displays and thinking similar thoughts.

The Sons of Shaitan showed no mercy, turning their weapons on the young and the old, the strong and the weak.
This was not so very different in concept – although drastically so in scale – to what my father had done with my brothers and I. Faced with biological limitations, humanity had found a way to surpass them in order to achieve the results we desired.
And respectfully, whatever rank long service has earned me, I’m a medicae.’
‘If he feels anything for the fallen men, he hides it well,’ said Fortreidon.

The main nave ran for a third of that length, and within the vast structure had been assembled the commanders and their staffs from every Chapter of the Legion.
‘I would have expected that suggestion from Ferrus, or maybe even Horus, but never Russ.
He rarely displayed any strong emotion, and so he betrayed no surprise at the discovery of the Ghennan’s inhuman nature.
‘Angron has failed to drag Hexx from the shores of death.
T’kell was laughing, and it took Rhy’tan a second to realise that he was too.
Atharva was loath to leave Zharrukin, but to stay would be to risk the lives of the conservator’s staff of archaeotechs and all they had unearthed thus far.
Fulgrim’s expression didn’t change, but Pyke could feel the sudden tension radiating from him.
‘Kor Phaeron is archdeacon, but in your absence might as well be Ecclesiarch.

‘The days when I could count my rivals on one hand are gone forever.’
They saw me coming, for I made no effort to hide.

Corax sipped the wine while Guilliman took a moment to formulate his answer.
As captain of a support vessel she was not privy to my true identity, but she was well aware that a lord of the XX Legion stood at her shoulder, and I had no doubt she wanted to impress.
A chunk of basalt the size of a Rhino missed Numeon by inches.
Little could be seen of Taranthis from the ground, for like the tezenite mine workings for which it was famed, the settlement was mostly dug beneath the hard sandstone and granite rock of the hinterlands known as the Copper Plate.
At Nedella, the Synan brothers transferred their cargo to other, more local contractors.
Now I will have to appoint new chief guardians of the armouries and museums.
But sooner or later you will have to answer to Ferrus Manus.’
In his mind’s eye, Perturabo saw what the planet would look like through the temporal wave: a moon’s reflection on a pool shattered into a thousand curved pieces by a cast stone.
The Lion visibly started, an expression of incredulity spreading across his face.
Kor Phaeron blink-activated an icon in his display to reply on the same frequency.

They’d fought raiders in the western provinces, and mutants in the Glass Waste.
He spied the chief of the Declined tribe close to his tent, conversing conspiratorially with his family.
When the Wolves charged, their cries were most often a cacophony of raw emotion, designed to be overwhelming and disorientating in their sheer volume and energy, but this was different.

Vorias wiped the blood from his eyes and knelt beside the young Lexicanum.
His methods have their place, but I shall show you a different way.’

The day would come, before too long, when the XX Legion would need to finally announce itself to the galaxy at large, even if I did not yet reveal myself.
Their pilots were assigned other roles for the war games and so were left behind with the bulk of the Fifty-second.’
At first, Elver took it to be a mountain, but it was far mightier than that.
As fusils hummed into life and feyblades crackled, the old slave was certain that Ahengi and his companions would execute the son as they would the father.
