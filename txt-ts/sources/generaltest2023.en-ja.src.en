The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.
Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.
To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object.
Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end.
But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.
So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.
Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support.
Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.
Scientific facts result from experiments.
The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered.
Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.
It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.
Going to be my first project car.
Picking this up this weekend.
I was looking for a good first car guy car; and I really love the 80s aesthetic.
Already on coil overs and lowered ride height.
I've done a little research but I would love if anyone has any info about this car.
Personal experiences?
I know they're not fast compared
#Venting into the Fediverse time.
The Domestic Partner and I went to the liquor store tonight for some beers and a bottle of bub.
When we went to check out, the cashier is a fairly obvious #trans woman.
Me, in board shorts and a wife beater, and The Domestic Partner, all tatted up and with a new haircut that he himself described as "making me look like a neo-nazi".
Her body immediately stiffened and there was this look of fear in her eyes.
And then we just... paid for our stuff.
And said thank you.
And I said her nails looked cool.
The smile of relief on her face was a great feeling but the fact that she was scared first FUCKING SUCKS AND I HATE IT.
This is the stupidest timeline and I hate it dot com.
Nothing stops Donald Trump from running for president while under indictment, after being convicted, or even from within a prison cell.
If elected, he would undoubtedly pardon himself to get out of prison.
But he can't pardon himself out of state prison.
It takes the state's governor.
The two states involved are New York and Georgia.
The latter's Governor Kemp will undoubtedly pardon Trump if convicted or even indicted by Fulton County DA Fannie Willis.
NY is the best hope for accountability
There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning.
In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario.
In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence.
At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings.
We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end.
Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication.
We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts.
The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy.
I really enjoyed catching up with Penny and Nicholas from Ashanti Development at the weekend for a chat about their progress.
Ashanti Development has been working with an ever-expanding number of communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana for approaching 20 years, engaging with communities and providing support with water and sanitation, education, healthcare, tree planting and farming.
Communities gain the knowledge to embed and support their own development.
I was fortunate enough to spend a memorable six months alongside Nicholas in 2011 supporting a range of projects.
When we caught up at the weekend I was chuffed to hear about progress, particularly with tree planting and farm support.
Thousands of trees have been established and farmers have seen increased crop yields through a range of interventions from support with equipment purchases to training.
Nicholas is working with farmers to reduce pesticide use while finding ways to address the issues caused by climate change and pests such as fall armyworm, which can devastate maize crops.
Photos from my visit to Ghana in 2011.
The UPS store near me won't allow me to write a label or write on the box.
The must print the label.
They won't allow me to tell them the address it's going to and who is shipping it.
I have to email some random address, with unformatted data, so the clerk can read the email and enter it into their system to print a label.
And they always to charge me $2.25 for that "convenience".
The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night.
It was an outrage, like a symbolic Jan 6 anti-democratic festivus of lies & grievance, self-destructively hosted by American media.
THE SHAMEFUL AUDIENCE.
Licht AGREED to an all Republican audience!
Who vetted & chose the individuals?
There's a story to be reported there.
The ratings--seeking delusional irresponsibility of it all.
It can't be repeated.
I have a very drafty basement, which essentially means I can get a lot of rodents taking refuge.
There have been a lot of signs of more rodents this past month or so, which has been exceptionally surprising as it's spring and I would have thought they would venture outdoors with the change in weather.
Nonetheless, I've had a smattering of plain old snap-traps placed about, and would dutifully replenish the peanut butter on them every few days, as the mice kindly lick it clean.
I finally got fed up with this routine last night, cleaned all the traps of peanut butter, and superglued a pistachio to them.
It worked.
(fwiw, I've tried nearly every "humane" trap on the market with very little success.
I'm not especially happy with killing them, but I won't be taking comments on the ethics of killing mice.)
I'm tired of conservative parties and governments wrapping themselves in the brand of pro-business.
They aren't, at least not in Alberta.
Sure they cut business taxes.
But they also cut grants and tax credits that encourage more business activity.
I own a business. It's successful in spite of the provincial government, not because of it.
Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station web sites are the absolute worst experience on the internet.
Popups, auto-play videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads.
I know that advertising is how they make their money, but all that garbage seems counterproductive if it drives people away.
This is true even now that goatse.cx is gone, though it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video the Wendy sent me.
On the first train today, the ticket checker looked at our tickets and said "long journey!"
"Yeah and I'm coming back today," I said.
"I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow," I attempted to explain, gesturing at my traveling companion.
"There's not something you hear a lot 'I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow,' " the ticket guy said.
It's a thing I've never said before either.
The thing that last night convinced me of is that we need to be ready to fight back against Trumpism.
Trumpism is a cult.
It is a cult that nobody really wants, except for the fanatics who are in it.
And they are truly nuts.
We can not allow them to hijack our country.
It is time to fight back.
Go out and protest now.
Get some bumper stickers that are anti-Trump and plaster them all over.
Yell back at those who would try to talk over us.
This is not normal.
This is not OK...
My neighbor & I arrived home at the same time and I could hear him coughing up a covid mucus storm from across the street.
So I rushed to get into my apt to avoid him but he still managed to catch up to me to chat.
I swear covid-infected people are zombies trying to infect everyone else.
It is not socially acceptable to go out in public or rush up to people when you are coughing up a mucus storm.
I repeat. It is not socially acceptable to spread your covid mucus storm everywhere!!!
Writing Wonders 5/11: Does your MC laugh or cry more?
Abe keeps his sorrows hidden and laughs easily while Tom is not afraid to cry but is less amused by rude humor.
Jan will hurt you before she lets you see she's hurt and laughs most when things are upside-down.
Mio knows that sorrow is life's constant companion.
After 4,000 of distress Yl finds herself in a place of love and is having huge feels she doesn't know what to do with so there's a lot of both.
#CNN needs to just close down.
Yesterday's fiasco with #MangoMoron was an outrageous fiasco.
Who at that pathetic, dying network was responsible for vetting the so-called "independent voters" in the audience?
Which cable news "executive" made the call to give the fat, lying criminal this much air-time?

One of the craziest parts about my neighbors turning against me is thinking about how much effort it takes to be hostile.
Forget me, fine.
Ignore me, fine.
It hurts but you gotta do you.
But at this point the open hostility and violence is getting worse.
That takes effort.
Slamming a door in my face takes effort.
Our dogs used to be BEST FRIENDS.
And I still have NO IDEA what I could have possibly done to deserve this.
They had keys to my apartment for 6+ years.
That vessel is off-limits.
I am aware of your hatred of Organa.
She is irrelevant to me.
You may kill her if you can.
But another individual often flies aboard that ship.
If he were to die... the consequences would be... significant.
I gripe about dad-ification a lot.
Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:
It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger).
The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.
Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as "caring."
Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic.
Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has.
In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success.

Ukrainian children have a right to grow up in a peaceful and secure environment.
Yet, unimaginable fear, terror and displacement have left them with the invisible scar of trauma.
This Tuesday, President von der Leyen met First Lady Olena Zelenska in Kyiv to discuss how to support her efforts to provide mental health assistance to vulnerable children.
We have already offered mental health and psychosocial support.
All our efforts will help them make it through this journey.
A bunch of shiny new goodness in #dart
Over time dart became my go-to for quick UI.
#flutter is a pleasure to work with, and they have #mobx for easy store management.
The dependency story is less insane than nodejs, too.
Of course flutter sucks really bad when it comes to behaving like a good native app would (anywhere, really. Even flutter web target sucks).
But it allows to move fast and that's why it's ideal for small hacks.

Looking for a list of the best vampire games on PC?
Being able to jump really high, tear regular humans to shreds, use creepy magic powers, and replenish health by feasting on your enemies - this should be a staple of all PC games, to be honest.

Dreamed my parents were playing my porn game and giving me feedback.
In real life, my mom did like a puzzle game I made years ago, and she found most of the secrets on her own, so she wasn't just being mom when she said she liked it.
So maybe she'll like my porn game too?
It maybe has too many language subtleties.
Need to translate it to Mandarin and/or Hokkien, neither of which I know at all.
Guess I'll have to see whether Bing or Google is better at translating dirty gay sex puns.
Been toying with this thought for a little while:
Mental health is often seen as something separate from "regular" health.
Why?
Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health.
In truth, the health of your mind, of your brain, is just as much an issue of health as the health of your foot.
Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible.
In the same way that mental health is seen as less "real" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind.
The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of "My sex is male, my gender is female" seems simplistic and inaccurate.
It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs.
I feel that to be trans is to be "biologically non-binary".
My sex is non-binary, my gender is female.
I think the designation of "non-binary" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex.
I've been, on and off, listening to the works of @iotar
There's a lot of well good stuff in this mysterious collective's backlog.
Like krauty moods and other worldly pop music and radiophonic workshop and all sorts.
Very much worth having a go at.
Also FWIW I like the archive.org interface a lot more than the desktop #bandcamp \- I've no idea how people use bc as their primary music platform (besides the political reasons).

I'd hate to base my business on tech from Google, to be honest, on the other hand Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross platform experience and it shows.
(And also: The Web is now largely a Google thing, unfortunately)
Also please refrain from telling me that google/flutter apps suck on iOS and macOS.
Cross platform is hard if you want to do it well.
I know that.
Thank you to those people who have downloaded the latest update to Leasey.
A few very small difficulties have come to light.
Nothing to set alarm bells ringing but nevertheless they are being addressed.
A small update will be produced next week to correct them.
Most of yesterday was spent installing the new update for some customers, and everyone who does need that assistance should have received it by now.
Have a good day!
Tech confession: I can't wrap my head around Grafana & Prometheus, at least from a server/application metrics and monitoring standpoint.
I don't know exactly know why my brain can't figure it out; it might be that the tools are just so broad and vague that my brain just hardlocks due to 'too many options'.
I want to make dashboards.
Grafana looks pretty.
Brain no work.
So with a new #FFXIV raid tier approaching, I've long been thinking "man, I'd like to try proper raiding, but Party Finder sounds like a mess, and I'm never gonna find a static that'll have me."
So I thought, screw it!
I'll make my own static!
Full of people too anxious to try joining a raid static, with no expectations of being good at all!
There's... no way that would work, probably!
...And that's how I found myself having to sort out a raid group roster.
I was a voracious reader in my youth.
Then, life crushed my soul and I lost all my passion for fiction and great storytelling.
But, after ~decades~ of reading next to nothing (with the exception of functional work-related non-fiction stuff and an occasional self-help book) I set a goal to read 23 books in 2023.
I'm now on book # 31 and it's only May.
I'm BACK baby!
I haven't really achieved anything.
I'm happy that a few people have come to me in private and said "look, because of all your work, I'm gonna grant you this amount of money".
I wanna see these companies that intermediate transactions explain to their customers how they set their percentages.
They're not gonna talk about this on Bloomberg!
But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.
Is it a danger to let migrants in at the southern border? I dunno.
Let them rehabilitate the hollowed out and decaying cities across the country. Again.
These people want to improve their lives.
White nationalists, gun fetishists, pro-dictator right wing.. there's the danger.
Deport the white supremacists.
I am so tired of the headlines claiming that "Remote work is dead." or that "Remote work was a failed experiment."
These headlines and articles usually reference one CEO at one large company.
It's all clickbait but it does worry me about the executives and managers who read these articles.
There was remote work prior to 2020.
There are still going to be jobs that can be accomplished remotely for the foreseeable future.
Remote work is enabling.
It enables people to work in comfortable spaces and not stuffy, noisy offices.
It enables accessibility for anyone with an internet connection and a good working space.
It enables people to avoid lengthy commutes that take time away from their day and their families.
To just ignore these facts is wrong.
Stop generalizing and try to understand how your employees actually get work done.

It's not just conservatives versus progressives, he told a seminar of more than 100 adherents in Grande Prairie.
"This is a war between the pro-humans and anti-humans," he said.
Parker referred to abortion, and modern urban women's impulse to delay having children for their careers' sake.
He also argues that NDP and progressives want to depopulate society for the sake of the environment.
"You are the carbon they are trying to reduce."
So like from the beginning for all my birthdays in the past, I always had rough ones.
Whenever May would pop up I dreaded trying to celebrate my bday.
Something would always happen, go wrong, or just end up stressful and depressing.
I fought over the years to get out of that mindset and to have better bdays.
It took years of changing my life and working hard but finally...
I'm starting to smile and enjoy my bday with no worries.
And today is already becoming a great day!
Winter is 30 days away in this little part of the Great Southern World.
But I can't be deceived!
This is the beginning.
The rain is falling and whilst/while it is not frozen, you ain't going dancing in it!
It's a fine day to order ice cream delivery.
It was a one dog night and that doggo was not getting off the bed not even for "Dog's Breakfast - Breakfast for Dog's!"

Does you know of a performant way for a web component to respond to being added/removed from a document?
This is for Wikipedia's component library (OOUI).
It is mostly semantic HTML with CSS, and generally does not require custom elements (which offers connectedCallback).

For performance, we don't observe the whole document.
We create a detached temp parent, install MO there, and observe it becoming detached (thus attached elsewhere).
Casper the #rat is an absolute unit these days.
I think my new job has been good for him - two free roams a day while I work, at fairly predictable times.
I finally got a good dangle photo so I can be sure he's not fat.
(In #rats, too high body fat can be bad for their health.)
He's not.
He's just absolutely ripped from tearing around my office twice a day.
I don't have a scale to weigh him, but he feels like he's well over a pound.
It makes me so happy to see him thriving.

It's 2023 and I still see people with iPhones actively avoid using Apple Maps.
Apple Maps comes default with iOS, and yet people would go out of their way to download and install Google Maps onto their iPhones.
No idea why.
Curious, I kept an open mind to compare how Google Maps and Apple Maps compare, on my test iPhone device (my daily driver is an Android device, so it's rare that I use an iPhone).
The experience having to follow directions was far superior on Apple Maps compared to Google Maps.
Apple Maps wins.
So why is it that people jump through extra hoops to install Google Maps?
No idea.
Could it be that Google Maps got to market first?
Was it the 2012 Apple Maps disaster?
Could it be that Google Search is integrated with Google Maps?
No idea.
That said, I'm biased.
I'm biased in favour of not releasing garbage to end users, and Apple royally fucked up with their Apple Maps when it came out in 2012.
Their bad reputation haunts them to this day.
But it's the land that makes it a good storer of wealth for as long as you think the government isn't going to change the system we live in.
The house itself declines in value because it loses its condition and needs to be replaced.
A lot of ppl think that they literally own the earth when they buy a piece.
Not the case.
In China you can only lease land.
They're not stupid enough to sell the sell forever.
The government can change these policies whenever it wants.
The land is temporary.
It seems inconceivable that land may be taken away one day when you watch Australian and United States media channels but that's because the rich are on there all day ensuring your mind thinks a certain way.
The land is very easily and quickly taken away by the government one day if they want to do that.
And guess what?
It never made sense how ppl can keep land at the expense of others.
It has to be taken away one day.
That's why the Chinese only allow leases.
They already ran out of land.

I often wonder at the human capacity to be *so* down on oneself while inundated by so much evidence of what actual cruelty looks like.
To agonize over personal failure & guilt in a world where "success" is so often bestowed on people responsible for the most reprehensible acts...
We're all such messy critters.
But gentling despair at our messiness is crucial - because it gives us more space to tackle the ruins all around.
So try not to forget, eh?
Kindness with ourselves is activism, too.

I don't agree that #Mastodon is difficult to setup.
Common, it's really not that hard.
But it's more difficult to find people to follow and build up your timeline.
I wish there was a "who to follow" recommendation somehow.
But apart from this, it is not difficult - if you use a 3rd party app like Elk and/or Ivory.
If you stick to the default web interface it doesn't look and feel good (imho).
So, it requires a bit more effort to get into it and you probably need a good app to improve #UX.
I don't know if prevention is possible, but it's worth trying.
The four steps I outline are up for debate, with some progress in each:
Description: names for incidents of human-algorithm behavior that account for algorithms & humans.
Explanation: account for both sides of mutual influence
Forecasting: anticipating harms before they happen (even if by minutes)
Interventions: knowledge about things we can do to create change, within some confidence bounds
I didn't watch the CNN town hall, but it seems as if Trump said exactly the same things he says every time he opens his mouth or presses Send on his phone.
Even if he didn't get to say them during the town hall, everyone in America will hear them anyway, repeatedly, between now and November 2024.
That's still no reason to give him another venue, but the harm is being exaggerated.
He'll win the primaries.
We can't will him away.
He's here and he's going to say this stuff no matter what.
Signed up for Google's "AI Test Kitchen" waitlist and got in same day.
It's very underwhelming at the moment.
The "MusicLM Demo" is mildly interesting.
You can ask for a specific piece of music like "jazz with a trumpet solo in 5/4 tempo" and it will generate two tracks for you after a few seconds.
It seems to understand tempo, but... the music's just... not good.
Throwing everything you've got over the fence in response to GPT is not it.

It's weird doing weightlifting but also having no real clue what your one-rep-max is, cus that's one of the key ways people track their progress.
I work out alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack.
Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights.
I bench press on my bed.
If I try and figure out my one rep max is I might not own enough weights to max out, or conversely it could seriously injure/kill me.
Anyway, load is going up today.
Still feels good.
I swear burrata didn't exist five years ago
This is my personal Mandela effect thing.
I'd never seen it in a cookbook.
I'd never seen it at the fancy grocer or any of the Italian delis.
I'd never seen anyone's mom make it or had it shoved at me at a party or seen it appear in conjunction with anyone's saucemaking escapades or baking days
It just appeared one day and suddenly it was available everywhere.
I've entered the burrata dimension.

In 1998-06 Gamefan, in relation to the long development of the first Unreal game, Jason Schrieber commented,
"A good game is only late until it ships.
A bad game is bad forever."
So was it Epic that originated this?
We can keep going.
An earlier issue of GamePro 1997-11 has a quote with far more ambiguity,
"Or, as an industry catch phrase goes: A late game is only late until it ships.
A bad game is bad for the rest of your life."
Is it so ephemeral then?
Merely a "catchphrase" with no clear originator?
Smoky, my 10 month old male Domestic Blue kitten, playing with a red rubber Apple Pencil comfort device bought from Amazon he absconded months ago.

I really like it.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching as you settle the flyer down on the red soil, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you climb out of the flyer and walk slowly towards them.
The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shake, as if in an earthquake and you lose your footing, though the Repnids seem unaffected.
The rock beneath you gives way suddenly.
Repnids have tunnelled below the surface and you fall into a boiling mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cavern below.
The end is swift, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs.
Nobody will ever know that you were the first human future traveller.

#today I have coffee, sunshine and quiet time!
I started a new shawl.
I am unsure of it at this time.
I found a unevenly spun silver gray yarn that is mostly finely spun with lumps.
I plan on mixing it with a fine purple/lilac variegated cotton.
But am not sure I have enough of the purple.
I am using a H hook with a similar double crochet pattern as I have done before.
I made the first join last night so we shall see.
Wishing everyone a happy Thursday!
However, I hate classes on fine arts and literature, and my school history bears it out.
I have literally tried and dropped EVERY SINGLE ONE.
And up until like two years ago, I had no idea until I checked my transcripts.
The literature class hatred is even worse: I love to read.
I hit most of the classics before eighteen--though that's more a reflection of living in bumfuck nowhere, I also read the 1979 Encyclopedia Brittanica in desperation.
My home is comfortable and wonderful and I am happy there, but I have to be somewhere else in order to chill enough to read fiction during the day without feeling guilty.
It's like I'm on holidays and therefore am doing what one does on holidays.
And that's also even though I haven't slept as well here for the last two nights as I do at home, and get a little #MECFS ed out from simply being in a strange environment where I'm less able to pace myself and have to remember where things are.
And that's also even though I do still have my to-do list and am organising my life as well.
Humanity is out in 5 days.
It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things that I love about working in games.
What will people think of it?
I like it but will it be able to attract an audience of the right players?
Will a community blossom around the user-generated content piece of the game?
(I am really hoping so.)
The game's story, ideas and questions it inspires feel timely.
Hoping things go well.
It's ThinkPad day!!
Came home on my lunch break to see this sitting outside uwu.
Wish I could take it back to work with me to setup more.
But that will have to wait till tonight.
So I finally watched #Heartstopper
Was it overly cute to the point of being twee?
Most definitely
Do any of these characters talk human beings?
Not even remotely
But did I love it?
Absolutely!
what was Olivia Coleman doing here?
Did she owe someone money?
Had a recent graduate artist take some critique badly tonight.
In part, because they'd be taught badly.
But it's important to not make excuses for issues and just fix them, especially in production when your lead needs changes.
Especially with the competition.
Every artist has been there, made the same mistakes.
Good critique is there to correct the problem quickly, and isn't directed at your ability.
It's assuming you have the ability to fix the problem, or find a solution.
So while composting and bloom scrolling are a wonderful reminder to look up, and be aware of life beyond the screen.
It is as important to explore servers and IP addresses.
Watch seeds being sown & cultivated (and not randomly scattered) by good peeps.
These roots are hidden.
Work is not visible.
But for strong and firm future growth.
Jami slipped the note to him when they passed each other on the path, just before the dog watch.
She was on her way to the wall, he was coming off duty.
He glanced behind him to watch her go, and to make sure they hadn't been seen.
She did not look back.
He waited until he was in the darkness of the bunk room before he pulled the note out and read it in a beam of light coming through the blackout curtains.
One block-printed word.
He spent a long time staring at it, trying to stay calm:

Police arrest 15 after violent protest outside UK refugee hotel
The incident comes after increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the Channel to the UK in boats.
Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers turned violent near the English city of Liverpool.
The Merseyside Police department said a police officer and two civilians sustained minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday night in Knowsley.
The police force said some protesters threw objects and set a police van on fire.
The people arrested, who ranged in age from 13 to 54, were detained "following violent disorder."
Merseyside police commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were a couple of injuries amongst the police officers."
The Home Office has been using the hotel to temporarily house asylum seekers since last year, according to local media.
George Howarth, who represents Knowsley in the UK Parliament, said the violence on Friday night did not reflect the community.
"The people of Knowsley are not bigots and are welcoming to people escaping from some of the most dangerous places in the world in search of a place of safety," he said.
"Those demonstrating against refugees at this protest tonight do not represent this community."
The protest took place amid heightened tensions as growing numbers of refugees and migrants cross the Channel in small boats.
More than 45,000 people reached the UK by that route in 2022, and most applied for asylum.
The system for considering asylum applications has slowed to a crawl because of political turmoil and bureaucratic delays, leaving many asylum seekers stuck in hotels or other temporary accommodations.
The Channel crossings have become a political issue, with the Conservative government promising to "stop the boats" and pursuing a plan to send such asylum seekers to Rwanda.
Opponents have accused the government of demonising desperate people fleeing war and poverty.
President's Cup: Candystripes defeat Rovers in season opener at Brandywell
Derry midfielder Adam Reilly closes down Lee Grace at the Brandywell
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup as they ran out 2-0 winners over Shamrock Rovers.
The FAI Cup holders defeated last season's league winners at the Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy.
The Hoops pushed to reduced terms in the second half but Ruaidhri Higgins' charges stood firm to win the curtain-raiser.
Derry travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday.
Patching's side-footed volley nudged Derry in front after 23 minutes - the midfielder opened the scoring as the Foylesider's ran out 2-1 winners over the eventual champions last February.
The Hoops went on to win the Premier Division by 13 points but Duffy soon had City further ahead with a long-range effort which managed to squirm under keeper Leon Pohls and into the net.
Last season's runners-up were two goals to good at the break.
Graham Burke went closest to reducing the arrears in the second period but the Candystripes were comfortable winners a week prior to their quest for national glory.
City boss Ruaidhri Higgins praised his team after what he said was the "hardest week of my life" following the death of his brother Kevin.
"It's a kick in the teeth and there's tough weeks ahead but we'll get on with it in his memory," said Higgins.
"To beat Shamrock Rovers and deservedly so with a good performance is really pleasing."
DHS hires law firm to handle possible Alejandro Mayorkas impeachment proceedings
The Department of Homeland Security has hired an outside law firm - Debevoise & Plimpton - to assist in possible impeachment proceedings for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, as he potentially faces charges by House Republicans regarding his handling of the southern border.
"The Department of Homeland Security has retained outside counsel to help ensure the Department's vital mission is not interrupted by the unprecedented, unjustified, and partisan impeachment efforts by some Members of Congress, who have already taken steps to initiate proceedings," a DHS spokesperson said in a statement Friday.
"DHS will continue prioritizing its work to protect our country from terrorism, respond to natural disasters, and secure our borders while responding appropriately to the over 70 Congressional committees and subcommittees that have oversight of DHS."
A DHS official tells CBS News the department has hired the firm for contracted work for the life of the congressional inquiry.
Debevoise was chosen because of its expertise in impeachment and bipartisan experience in working with Congress on oversight.
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas speaks during a joint news conference with Mexican officials at the State Department in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, 2022.

The Justice Department recently advised that the contract with Debevoise qualifies as an appropriate expenditure for DHS.
DHS is trying to ensure that its mission isn't undermined by partisan attacks and that proceedings against Mayorkas are being handled by people with the appropriate expertise.
Mayorkas has not commented on this development, but asked about the impeachment inquiry last Thursday, he told reporters, "We will cooperate with this Congress, just as we did with the last Congress. I think that's our responsibility."
He conceded that "it will take time" to comply with the House's investigation.
"I will spend that time as will others and we will also not compromise the time that we spend in fulfilling our mission."
A DHS senior official confirmed that Mayorkas has not yet met with his new outside counsel.
Only one cabinet member has ever been impeached, Secretary of War William Belknap.
In 1876, Belknap, who served in President Ulysses S. Grant's administration, was accused of accepting bribes but was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.

Four teens charged in attack of 14-year-old who died of suicide after beating video was posted online
Dad says daughter took her own life after being bullied at NJ school
Dad says daughter took her own life after being bullied at NJ school 02:33
Four New Jersey teenagers have been charged in connection with the attack of a 14-year-old girl who later took her own life after video of the incident was posted on social media.
One juvenile is charged with aggravated assault, two juveniles are charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and one juvenile is charged with harassment, Ocean County prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer told CBS News in an email.
Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her Bayville home on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online.
The video showed girls throwing a drink at the teen, then kicking and dragging her down school hallways.
They pushed Adriana into red lockers lining the school hallways and one of the girls in a pink shirt punched Kuch repeatedly.
Another girl outside of the video frame laughed as she recorded the scene.
Two adults came in to break up the attack, with one adult pulling the teens apart.
Adriana lay hurt and bruised on the hallway floor as the adult tried to help her up.
One of the girls said, "That's what you get."
"She loved life. She was the happiest kid. Everybody loved her," her father, Michael Kuch, told CBS New York on Thursday, adding that he's angry and wants everyone to see the video and what the teens did to his daughter.

Kuch said police should have been called immediately because the students, who he said his daughter had been having problems with, smashed her face with a 20-ounce bottle.
"If they called the police and did an investigation, those girls would not have posted videos from school," Kuch said.
He also said his daughter, who had bruises on her body, should've been taken to the hospital.
"We always address every issue of bullying and on the day of the incident four students were suspended," Dr. Triantafillos Parlapanides, superintendent of schools, told CBS New York.
School officials told CBS New York that they notified the family and called Adriana's death horrible.
Each teenager and their guardian was served with a copy of their complaint and were released pending future court appearances, the prosecutor told CBS News.
Students at the school staged a walkout Wednesday in support of Adriana's family.

I talked to 30 health, wellness professionals about avoiding burnout
In our day-to-day lives, we're constantly looking for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs.
This can be extremely difficult for those in the healthcare industry, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness professionals the same question: "How do you manage your energy and not burn out in your profession?"
Their careers range from infectious disease doctors to psychologists to mindfulness teachers - and they all had great advice to give on how to stay motivated and keep the ball rolling.
Despite the large differences in their roles, there were several themes within their responses that stood out as ways to prevent burnout.
Here are the top four approaches that they use.
1.Build a strong community
As someone who works with patients who have terminal illnesses, Eufrosina Young thanks her strong support system for her ability to maintain her energy.
Young is a board-certified neurologist and ALS specialist at the Upstate University Hospital's department of neurology, and says they "mobilize like an army of people" there.
There isn't a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but knowing that she isn't the only one putting in the hard work to develop treatments and provide better options for her patients, keeps Young going even on her hardest days.
"We're not carrying the weight of the world, but being part of a world of people that are advocating for this work," she says.
2.Rest when you need to
Working two jobs as a sleep researcher and an algorithm engineer, all while taking care of a new baby, would have definitely led Raphael Vallat to burnout if he didn't rest, he says.
"I feel like when I'm about to burn out, basically every task feels like a mountain that you need to climb, and feels super urgent and important," says Vallat.
In those moments, "you really need to take some time off and realize that these tasks can wait."
Typically, Vallat finds moments in his day where he can pause and spend time in nature to ground himself before returning to work.
3.Be passionate about what you're doing and remember your purpose
Up until spring of 2022, infectious disease specialist Céline Gounder worked 100 hours a week for seven days a week.
Being on the frontlines during the pandemic ate up almost all of her time, but she avoided burnout by reminding herself about why her work is important.
"I don't think work feels like work when you feel like you're having an impact," says Gounder.
"If you're working crazy hours doing something that has no meaning to you, I think you really do need to step back and question what you're doing."
4.Have other joys
Across the board, each of the experts said they engage in some hobby like exercise, dancing and even playing the guitar.
It's extremely important to have a life you enjoy that exceeds what you accomplish in your job, says Christina Maslach, social psychologist, retired professor of psychology at U.C. Berkeley and author of "The Burnout Challenge: Managing People's Relationships with Their Jobs."
"Look at your life as a whole, and make sure there's good things about it, and make sure you have time for them."

Juvenile charged with murder in December Chicago school shooting that left 2 dead
A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police announced Friday.
The suspect is charged with two counts of felony first-degree murder and two counts of felony attempted murder, Chicago Police superintendent David Brown announced.
"We currently don't have a clear motive for why a 16 year old would want to shoot and kill other kids," Brown said.
The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would face the murder and attempted murder charges as an adult.
Four teenagers were shot December 16 at Benito Juarez High School.
The victims who died were both boys, aged 14 and 15, police announced at the time.
Investigators say tips from the public helped lead them to the suspect, who was arrested Thursday.
"We are grateful for those who have been brave enough to come forward to ensure that the offender is caught and will now be held accountable," said Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx.
The suspect is expected to appear in Bond Court Saturday, Brown said, where more details about the evidence they have collected will be presented.
Minnesota biologists rescue trapped black bear
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a bear-y unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch.
The bear had hunkered down in a culvert alongside the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department.
But when the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice, according to the department.
Staff from the department quickly responded to the scene and helped remove the bear.
The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and pronounced him healthy but groggy - obviously, because he'd been woken up from his winter sleep," according to the Facebook post.
The department then relocated the bear to a state sanctuary to resume his hibernation.
The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.
The department reminded residents that moving bears is a job best left to the professionals.
If you're worried about a bear in your neighborhood, you should contact local authorities - not try to move or feed the sleeping giant.
In this case, bystanders first tried to dig out the bear by themselves and offered him food, including Pop-Tarts, lettuce and Fancy Feast cat food.
But, luckily for the well-intentioned diggers, "because bears don't have the desire to eat in the winter, the bear didn't bite."
Minnesota is home to between 12,000 and 15,000 black bears, found mainly in the northern third of the state, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
The predators hibernate for as long as six or seven months in the winter, during which time they do not eat and live off of their stored body fat.
Photos: Following restorations, Egypt inaugurates the Djehuty and Hery tombs
The tombs of Djehuty and Hery have been inaugurated on Thursday following the completion of restoration work.
The inauguration was conducted by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt Mostafa Waziri, Ambassador of Span to Egypt Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino.
Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered through the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission from the Supreme Council of Antiquities and CSIC, working since 2002.
He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research related to the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor.
They succeeded in uncovering many tombs, coffins, mummies and a funerary garden.
Important tombs from an important era
Wazir explained that these two tombs belong to prominent people, who lived during the beginning of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt.
He said that the layout of the tombs are T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs from the 18th dynasty.
These consistent of an entrance, a column hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls featuring distinct inscriptions.
Waziri added that Djehuty was supervisor of the state treasury and overviewed works of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.
Djehuty was also responsible for recording Hatshepsut's journey to Puntland, and providing electrum (a mixture of gold and silver) for covering the top of the obelisks that she placed in the Karnak temples.
In addition, he was in charge of the process of moving the obelisks.
The room that precedes the Djehuty's burial chamber features inscriptions engraved with 43 chapters of the Book of the Dead, the first time that the chapters of the book were written on the walls of tombs before being written on linen and papyrus.
Hery, held the position of superintendent of the royal stores of the sacred royal wife and mother, Ahhotep.
Jared O'Mara should never have been a Labour candidate, says Rachel Reeves
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year jail sentence, the shadow chancellor has said.
Rachel Reeves was talking to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local party quit in protest at how Labour's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
The entire selection committee in Bolton North East resigned after they were not allowed to choose the shortlist, an increasingly common practice in Keir Starmer's Labour party, saying: "Yet again, it appears that the Labour party is seeking to promote the views and attitudes of a clique in London, rather than local members in the north."
They added: "This goes against the attitude necessary to win back the red wall, which is so desperately needed to deliver a Labour government."
Reeves said: "I don't know what the circumstances are of what has happened in Bolton, but I do know that those being selected are strong candidates, often with very strong roots in their communities."
There has been particular unhappiness that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and aide to the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, was not longlisted to try to win the seat back from the Conservatives, despite garnering nominations from four big trade unions.
Reeves said she had nothing to do with candidate selection, but added: "I do know that it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can be longlisted and who can be shortlisted."
O'Mara was imprisoned for four years this week after a jury found he had submitted fake expense claims totalling £52,000 in an attempt to fund his cocaine and alcohol abuse.
Many people have suggested he was not properly vetted by Labour when he was selected to fight Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, in Sheffield Hallam in 2017"s snap general election.
Asked if the O'Mara debacle was looming large in the minds of Labour's NEC, Reeves said: "I don't want to suggest in any way that anyone not on a shortlist is a cocaine user.
But Jared O'Mara was a terrible case.
He should never have been selected as a Labour candidate; he should never have been an MP.
He used public money, it's absolutely right he's received his sentence."
The O'Mara circumstances were "pretty exceptional," said Reeves, but she acknowledged: "There are important lessons to be learned for the Labour party and all political parties on the selection of candidates.
But I would also say, in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards falling well short of what you could expect."
She added: ""One thing I would say about the Labour party is that when people do wrong, they lose the whip. And that's just not the case in the Conservative party."

Reeves was in Bolton to meet apprentices at a training centre for Openreach, which provides the UK's broadband network.
After watching apprentices climb up pretend telegraph poles at the £1.7m site, Reeves discussed Labour's plans to overhaul the apprenticeship levy, which forces larger firms to put aside 0.5% of their payroll to fund apprentices.
Businesses complain the levy is too inflexible. For example, said Reeves, Openreach "wants to retrain people who work on copper to work on fibre, but the apprenticeship levy doesn't have that flexibility around retraining."
Reeves said Labour would change the levy so companies could use the money to retrain employees in industries such as the automotive sector and those currently fitting gas boilers.
"We need them as part of the energy transition to net zero to be learning the skills to work on electric vehicles or fitting heat pumps or hydrogen boilers.
We want those people to be retrained to get the skills that they need to succeed.
And yet the apprenticeship levy is stacked up against them.
Businesses want greater flexibility and young people starting off in life or older people who want to retrain to make sure that their skills are relevant for the future," said Reeves.
One arrested amid Tate Britain protest over drag queen children's event
One person has been arrested amid a protest outside Tate Britain, where a drag queen storytelling event for children was being hosted.
The Metropolitan police said one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment towards a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster.
No injuries have been reported and officers remain at the scene, the force said.
The Tate was hosting Drag Queen Story Hour UK on Saturday, with tales told by Aida H Dee, who the gallery's website describes as "the first drag artist in Europe to read stories to children in a nursery."
A rightwing group of protesters demonstrated outside the gallery and were met by counterprotesters led by trans-rights campaigners and political groups, including Stand Up to Racism.
Officers had to form a corridor so attenders could get into the venue.
Writing on Twitter, the drag queen said the day had been "proper emotional," adding that five protesters had gained entry to the Tate and "caused a disruption" in parts of the building, but they did not affect the readings.
She had previously told Pink News that the invite to the Tate for the event during LGBTQ+ history month had been "an honour."
Her readings have previously been targeted by protesters.
The Drag Queen had said that "risk assessments" had taken place beforehand - but added it was "ridiculous" that they were necessary.
Aida tweeted: "5 haters made it into the Tate. They caused a disruption. BUT not to Drag Story Hour UK ...They made a fuss elsewhere in the building, not where the show was!! SHOW 2 went swimmingly!!!"
Aida had been staging three storytelling sessions on Saturday at 11am, noon and 2pm.
A spokesperson for the Tate said: "We do not programme artists in order to promote particular points of view, nor to reconcile differing points of view."
Our galleries offer a broad programme and visitors have the freedom to choose which aspects of it they engage with."
Trump's Prized 40 Wall Street Building On 'Lender Watch' Amid Dropping Income: Report
Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is on "lender watch" amid plummeting income and increasing costs, Bloomberg reported Friday.
The vacancy rate at the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to almost 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported.
Expenses, meanwhile, have reportedly risen 11% since the origin of the 2015 mortgage.
Trump has often bragged about the building he acquired in 1995, which was appraised at $540 million in 2015.
The day of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, a Trump bragged in a TV interview that 40 Wall Street was suddenly the tallest building in the city.
Not only was his claim insensitive, it was also a lie.
Another nearby skyscraper on Pine Street in Lower Manhattan became the tallest building after the destruction of the Twin Towers.
High-rise office leasing in Manhattan has been dropping for years, which was exacerbated after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as many companies shut down and employees of surviving firms worked remotely.
Wells Fargo, which is servicing the mortgage on 40 Wall Street, "has reached out to the borrower for a status of leasing developments" and the plans to improve the property's performance, according to the filing, Bloomberg reported.
Wagner owner says war in Ukraine will drag on for years
The owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine has predicted that the war could drag on for years.
Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas.
He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.
The statement from Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed "Putin's chef" for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, marked a recognition of the difficulties that the Kremlin has faced in the campaign, which it initially expected to wrap up within weeks when Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south.
The Kremlin has avoided making forecasts on how long the fighting could continue, saying that what it called the "special military operation" will continue until its goals are fulfilled.
The Russian forces have focused on Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the Donbas region where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
Prigozhin said that the Wagner Group mercenaries were continuing fierce battles for control of the Ukrainian stronghold of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.
He acknowledged that the Ukrainian troops were mounting fierce resistance.
As Russian troops have pushed their attacks in the Donbas, Moscow has also sought to demoralize Ukrainians by leaving them without heat and water in the bitter winter.
On Friday, Russia launched the 14th round of massive strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other vital infrastructure.
High-voltage infrastructure facilities were hit in the eastern, western and southern regions, resulting in power outages in some areas.
Ukraine's energy company, Ukrenergo, said Saturday that the situation was "difficult but controllable," adding that involved backups to keep up power supplies but noting that power rationing will continue in some areas.
Ukraine's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said that Russian forces launched 71 cruise missiles, 35 S-300 missiles and seven Shahed drones between late Thursday and midday Friday, adding that Ukrainian air defenses downed 61 cruise missiles and five drones.
The Ukrainian authorities reported more attacks by killer drones later on Friday.
The Ukrainian air force said the military downed 20 Shahed drones in the evening.
Late Friday, Russian military bloggers and some Ukrainian news outlets posted a video showing an attack by a sea drone on a strategic railway bridge in the Odesa region.
The grainy video showed a fast-moving object approaching the bridge in Zatoka, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Odesa, and exploding in a powerful blast.
The authenticity of the video couldn't be verified.
The Ukrainian military hasn't commented on the attack, and Serhii Bratchuk, a spokesman for the regional administration, wouldn't confirm the drone attack when he spoke in televised remarks on Saturday.
The bridge, which was targeted by Russian missile strikes early in the war, serves the railway link to Romania, which is a key conduit for Western arms supplies.

'Yellowstone' actor Q'orianka Kilcher beats fraud charges
Attorney Camille Vasquez, who represented Johnny Depp in last year's blockbuster defamation trial, has scored another legal victory - this time with "Yellowstone" actor Q'orianka Kilcher.
On Friday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office cleared Kilcher, 32, of all charges in a workers" compensation fraud case.
In a statement shared Friday with The Times, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County district attorney said the court "determined that Ms. Kilcher did not commit insurance fraud and advised the court that we were unable to proceed."
In July 2022, California officials charged Kilcher with two felony counts of workers" compensation fraud, accusing her of illegally collecting more than $96,000 in disability benefits between October 2019 and September 2021.
The time frame also includes several months when Kilcher worked on "Yellowstone," despite the actor's claims that she was too injured to work.
Kilcher self-surrendered and was arraigned in May.
"Today, I am beyond grateful that my case has been dismissed - tomorrow my journey begins to help raise awareness and demand more transparency for worker's rights within the workers comp system" Kilcher said Friday in a statement shared with The Times.
She added that she "look[s] forward to shedding more light on this experience and continuing to do the work I love."
Kilcher also thanked Vasquez and her fellow Brown Rudnick attorney Steve Cook for "their steadfast belief in my innocence."
According to TMZ, Kilcher hired the two in September.
Kilcher broke out with Terrence Malick's 2002 movie "The New World," where she portrayed Pocahontas.
Her credits also include "Sons of Anarchy," "The Alienist" and "Dora and the Lost City of Gold."
She most recently appeared in the road-trip film "Dog," starring Channing Tatum.

Balenciaga boss calls holiday campaign 'stupid mistake'
Luxury clothing brand Balenciaga is still reeling from the backlash over two of its recent ad campaigns.
Months after the fashion house came under heat for promotional images that critics said sexualized children, Balenciaga artistic director Demna (full name Demna Gvasalia) said he's still sorry for the images in an interview with Vogue published Friday.
"I want to personally apologize for the wrong artistic choice of concept for the gifting campaign with the kids and I take my responsibility," he told Vogue, echoing a previous statement he posted to social media in December.
In November, the brand shared photos for its "The Gift" collection, which featured child models posing with teddy bears that were dressed in bondage attire.
Shortly after, Balenciaga dropped photos for its spring 2023 campaign that featured a page from a 2008 Supreme Court case involving "virtual child pornography" in the background.
Parents, including reality TV star and longtime Balenciaga fan - and brand partner - Kim Kardashian, spoke out against the brand and its "disturbing images" on social media.
Days later, Balenciaga released a statement apologizing for the photos and outlining the changes it would implement to avoid similar "mistakes" in the future.
"This experience has forced me to reevaluate a lot of things in the way I, we, work, in the way we create and communicate images, the way we interact with our audiences, and the way we learn from our mistakes and move forward," Demna told Vogue.
He detailed the postbacklash changes at Balenciaga: "restructuring the image department," conducting more internal and external checks for campaign imagery, and partnering with the National Children's Alliance to help "thousands of kids in the process of overcoming trauma and dealing with their mental health."
"It's the one thing that makes me happy about this whole horrible situation: to do something good out of it," he said of that partnership, which was announced Wednesday.
Also teaming up with the NCA is Balenciaga's parent company, Kering, which oversees other luxury brands including Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta.
Under the Kering umbrella is Gucci, which faced backlash in December for a campaign featuring Harry Styles that some social media critics alleged also sexualized children.
In the interview, Denma said he plans to move away from the brand's "provocative" ways.
"This is part of my learning: I will have a more mature and serious approach to everything I release as an idea or an image," he said.
"I have decided to go back to my roots in fashion as well as to the roots of Balenciaga, which is making quality clothes - not making image or buzz."
Speaking of the brand's origins, elsewhere in the interview Demna said one of the most "painful" parts of the backlash was tarnishing "the name of Balenciaga and the legacy of Cristóbal Balenciaga."
"Balenciaga is a house that is over one century old and is based on strong and beautiful creative values, and I have been busy doing all in my creative power to bring it to its modern relevance, and suddenly we were under attack and labeled as something we're not at all," Demna said.
"We certainly made a huge and stupid mistake with the gifting campaign, and we certainly have learned from it."
It's Fake News, CBN Debunks Claim It Lacks Capacity To Print More New Naira Notes
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has described as misleading, the report that claimed to be quoting CBN govemor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, as attributing the current challenge in the distribution of the newly redesigned Naira banknotes to a shortage of printing materials at the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company Plc.
In a statement issued on Saturday, CBN spokesman, Osita Nwasinobi, said at no time did the CBN governor made such statement during his presentation to the National Council of State at its meeting on Friday, February 10, 2023.
Mr Nwasinobi said Emefiele only told the meeting that the NSPMC was working on printing all denominations of the Naira to meet the transaction needs of Nigerians.
He said while the CBN appreciates the concerns shown by all stakeholders about the distribution of the new Naira notes, "we are alarmed at the extent to which vested interests are attempting to manipulate facts and pitch the public against the Bank."
Nwasinobi said the CBN remains committed to performing its monetary policy functions, as stipulated in the CBN Act, 2007 (as amended).
"We also wish to restate that the NSPMC has the capacity and enough materials to produce the required indent of the Naira.
"The bank, therefore, wishes to appeal to the public to disregard the said report and exercise more restraint, even as we work assiduously to increase the circulation of the new notes in the country," he added.
On a particular voice note trending on the social media alleging that the CBN planned to shut down some banks, particularly in a particular geopolitical region of the country, the CBN said there was no such plan and that the claims were illogical and do not comply with the workings of the Nigerian banking system.
"The public is therefore advised to ignore such recordings as they do not represent the policy thrust of the CBN and are only the desperate attempts of persons bent on inciting the public against the Bank," he stated.
Tim Sherwood tears into £44m signing Pedro Porro after dismal Tottenham debut
Porro had an afternoon to forget against Leicester (Picture: Getty)
Tim Sherwood tore into Pedro Porro's "absolutely disgusting" defending during Tottenham's 4-1 defeat to Leicester City.
Spurs signed the right-back from Sporting CP on transfer deadline day on an initial loan deal for £5million with the obligation to buy this summer for £39million.
The 23-year-old was handed his debut by Antonio Conte on Saturday at the King Power Stadium with his side taking the lead after 14 minutes through Rodrigo Bentancur.
But it turned into an miserable afternoon with Nampalys Mendy, James Maddison and Kelechi Iheanacho all scoring to give Leicester a 3-1 at half-time with Porro enduring a torrid first-half in the Premier League.
The Spaniard was at fault again as Leicester thought they had added a fourth through Barnes and while the goal was ruled out for offside, former Spurs manager Sherwood was left shocked by the full-back's defensive efforts.
"I don't want to keep picking on the kid but he needs to be relieved of his duties," Sherwood told Soccer Saturday.
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because it is his debut but Pedro Porro is no bad it is unbelievable.
His positioning is absolutely disgusting, Barnes and Maddison are destroying him down the left hand side.
Daniel Levy was saying this week, they have spent a lot of money, yes they have, but their recruitment has been very poor and this is the latest addition.
Let's not make any conclusions at the moment but what I am looking at is a player who does not want to defend.
More: Premier League
"Antonio Conte has complained about the defending and this player, at the moment is struggling to defend. He is up against very good players in Barnes and Maddison but it is very disappointing."
While the goal was ruled out, Leicester restored their 4-1 lead with Barnes on target nine minutes from full-time.
Despite beating Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move ahead of Newcastle into third place.

Jack Smith should win any privilege fight over Mike Pence subpoena
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to muck up this latest development in the Justice Department's probe?
The short answer is that any attempt to scuttle the Pence subpoena on executive privilege grounds should fail.
First off, there's a threshold question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege.
Recall that Trump tried and failed to block the House Jan. 6 committee from getting White House records.
The Supreme Court declined to take up Trump's appeal last year, with only Justice Clarence Thomas (husband of 2020 election denier Ginni Thomas) dissenting.
But the court left open the question of whether an ex-president can claim privilege, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting he'd support such a claim.
So it's at least unclear whether a former president can claim the privilege, saying nothing of whether the claim would succeed.
Plus, the Supreme Court appeal over then-President Richard Nixon's attempt to avoid subpoena compliance shows that a vague privilege assertion won't do, and can be overcome by a specific need for evidence.
The court observed in 1974"s United States v. Nixon:
... when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.
The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.
Therefore, precedent is on the government's side.
Of course, however, delays from litigating even a losing issue can be a victory of sorts for Trump.
But further dampening the odds of a successful privilege claim is the previous rejection of Trump's attempt to block Jan. 6 grand jury testimony.
As The Washington Post reported in October, that rejection noted that former Pence aide Marc Short, for example, "probably possessed information important to the Justice Department's criminal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol that was not available from other sources."
That Pence, too, likely has unique information would help the DOJ in any subpoena fight.
And the reason we think Pence has such information is yet another reason that a privilege claim should fail.
That's because Pence has chosen to write publicly about at least some of his supposed conversations with Trump in connection with Jan. 6.
It's hard to say communications are privileged when you've previously deemed them fit to publicize.
So while the subpoena might present varying political and personal calculations for Pence - who may vie for the 2024 Republican nomination against Trump, someone who effectively condoned calls for Pence's extrajudicial execution on Jan. 6 - the courts should have an easy time siding with DOJ on privilege.
The Case Against a Biden Run Is Obvious - and Weak
Why is this important?
While Biden and his fellow Democrats can't do much in the way of passing laws with the GOP in control of the House, they can still spend the next two years setting an example.
Collectively, everyone on the team should be seeking out opportunities to play Gallant to the Republicans" weird Goofus impulses.
But it's also important for Biden to burnish his credibility with the American people - and maybe be a direly needed change agent in our all-too-tatty political culture.
Washington, a notoriously cynical place, is famous for its common sense-crippling ideas about leadership.
Perhaps one of the most notorious is the odd standard that holds that publicly admitting errors is a sign of weakness and that politicians should go to comical lengths to avoid doing so.
There's another way: In Bailout, Neil Barofsky's memoir of his time in Washington serving as the special inspector general overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, he described the advice he received from Kristine Belisle, the woman he smartly hired to be his communications director.
It was about as anti-Washington as it can get: "We'll admit and even highlight our mistakes."
As she went on to explain, there's method in a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would deem madness:
This is the best way to earn the press's trust.
They'll know we're not spinning like everyone else.
SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source for information in Washington about TARP.
We might be embarrassed at times and disclose things that we could - and others would - easily hide, but we'll shock the press with our honesty.
No one else does this, and before long, we'll have a built in defense when we're attacked.
No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us, because we'll prove to them that we tell the truth.
This is perhaps the biggest reason for Biden to pursue the course of radical responsibility-taking: Moments inevitably arise in any presidency when having the trust of the public and the institutions that safeguard the civic interest is critical.
Moreover, there is vital capital to be earned by owning our mistakes, and there's an important distinction that Biden can draw with his political opponents.
The president would do well to follow the old adage: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Some Super Bowl Commercials I Can't Wait to See

The "zoom zoom" kid but the bit is that now he's an adult.
Biden DOJ 'Doesn't Want an Armed Citizenry'
Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) sat down with Breitbart News on Thursday and discussed his plans to block the ATF pistol brace rule and his conviction that the Biden Department of Justice "doesn't want an armed citizenry" in the first place.
Clyde made clear his opposition to the pistol brace rule.
His reasons for that opposition include both general objections and more specific ones.
Generally, he expressed his conviction that our Founding Fathers did not set forth a plan of governance that included federal agencies making laws in place of the legislature.
He said, "The Justice Department is there to enforce the law, not to make the law. When you have the executive branch making the law and enforcing the law, then you have have a king, and a kingdom. Our Founders did not call for a king and they did not lay out a kingdom in the Constitution of the United States."
Clyde then moved to specifics regarding the pistol brace rule and expressed his concern that the rule is part of a greater ATF push to acquire broader registration of firearms.
He noted, "What the ATF wants is they want to increase the registration database for the National Firearms Act. They want to register people across the country because, as we know, what comes before confiscation is registration. And confiscation, in my opinion, is the ultimate goal, because this Justice Department doesn't want an armed citizenry."
He added, "But this Justice Department wants a registered citizenry, so they know who's got what, so they can come after us."
Clyde's contention is that the ATF pistol brace rule was born in this environment of hostility toward the Second Amendment and toward private gun ownership, and he plans to fight it tooth and nail.
He said he has "three tools" with which to fight the rule.
The first of those tools is the SHORT Act and the second is the Congressional Review Act.
On January 30 Breitbart News quoted Clyde outlining his plan to "reintroduce the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act, or the SHORT Act, to repeal elements of the National Firearms Act, thereby prohibiting the ATF from registering and banning pistols with stabilizing braces."
He also noted that he would "introduce a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, to override the Biden administration's unlawful overreach."
Both acts, the SHORT Act and the Congressional Review Act, have the possibility of blocking the ATF pistol brace rule.
But as Clyde told Breitbart News Thursday, the great challenge is that both of those routes will ultimately require President Biden's signature, either to enact the SHORT Act legislation or to finalize a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act.
He made clear that getting Biden's signature is not an impossibility, as there are ways; for instance, the SHORT Act legislation could be added to other, larger bills that Democrats are very anxious to pass.
However, Clyde indicated there is also a third way to block the ATF pistol brace rule.
He said: "I'm on the Appropriations Committee and we can defund this pistol brace rule, through what is called a limitation amendment. We can literally defund this rule and basically say, "No money may be spent executing or enforcing this particular pistol brace rule."
And we can also do the very same thing with the ATF receiver/frame rule, from last August.
I think both of them need to be defunded and I look forward to working with our appropriators to do it.

'We Hope' Biden Has a Plan for Handling Title 42 Ending, 'If They Do, They Haven't Shared It Fully'
On Friday's edition of NBC's "MTP Now," Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said that he has "a lot of concern" over what will happen when Title 42 ends in May, he hopes the Biden administration has a plan for when the policy ends, and that "If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet."
And said that "we've said, you need a plan. We want them to vet it with us."
Polis stated that he wishes that more time was spent on the issue of immigration during the meeting of governors at the White House, but the issue "came up."
We did have Secretary Mayorkas there for part of it.
And so, we brought up, again, there's a lot of concern I share about what will happen when Title 42 ends in May and so, making sure that the federal government has a plan.
We hope they do.
If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet.
But we've said, you need a plan.
We want them to vet it with us.
We want to make sure it's not what we experienced in December times five or times three, that would be a disaster for the country and it would be terrible for the Biden administration.

McDonald's withdraws "tasteless" advert near crematorium - RT World News
McDonald's has apologized after an advertisement for the fast-food chain's "McCrispy" burger was placed close to a crematorium in the UK - although some locals did see the funny side.
The restaurant chain has pledged to remove the offending advertising hoarding following complaints from residents of Truro in the UK county of Cornwall.
It had gained attention on social media on Friday for being placed on a busy road directly opposite an establishment which offers cremation services.
The brightly lit advert, which was placed directly behind a sign pointing to the crematorium, was branded as "tasteless" by some angry locals.
"Although I can see the funny side, it is tasteless and I'm sure some grieving family members won't like to see it when visiting Penmount for the funeral and cremation of a loved one," said a resident whose mother-in-law was cremated at the funeral home last year, as quoted by British media.
However, not everyone was quite so offended by the unfortunate placement of the advertisement, with one noting that a person's reaction to it would likely be influenced by "how long ago you followed the crematorium sign wearing a black tie."
One person said they "fell off the chair laughing" when they spotted the advert online, while it was also noted by another local that it was "no worse" than the council's decision to entertain the idea of allowing a crematorium to be built "next door to a retirement village."
A statement issued by McDonald's was published by local media on Friday soon after an image of the advertisement went viral online, in which the restaurant chain said it would remove the advert as soon as possible.
"We were unaware of the road sign in the vicinity of this bus stop. However, in light of the concerns raised by CornwallLive, we have asked for our advertisement to be removed," the fast-food brand said.
Cornwall Council, which operates both the crematorium and the bus shelter which displays the advert, declined the comment on the furor when contacted by local media.
'Gut instinct' missing woman is not in river
Searches for missing English woman Nicola Bulley have entered a 16th day after her partner said his "gut instinct" is that she is not in the river.
Lancashire Police said officers are keeping an "open mind" while continuing to appeal for information about Ms Bulley, who disappeared on 27 January while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre.
The force is continuing to search the River Wyre towards the sea at Morecambe Bay, working on one hypothesis that the 45-year-old, from Inskip, could have fallen in.
Their search has been aided by specialists and divers from HM Coastguard, mountain rescue, and Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, with sniffer dogs, drones, and police helicopters deployed.
Ms Bulley vanished while walking her springer spaniel Willow near the river, shortly after dropping her daughters, aged six and nine, at school.
The mortgage adviser's phone was found on a bench overlooking the river, still connected to a work call.
Her partner, Paul Ansell said he wants to keep "all options open" about her disappearance, but his "gut instinct" tells him she is not in the river.
He described Ms Bulley as "fun," "loving," "the most loyal friend you could ever have" and an "exceptional mum" who "absolutely adores our girls."
"She's just a pillar of strength to our family and without her, the hole is bigger than you can possibly imagine," he told 5 News.
Mr Ansell said that although the family is going through "unprecedented hell," hope that his partner will be found is "stronger than ever."
Police have discounted foul play and are treating the incident as a missing person inquiry.
On Thursday, the focus of their search switched from St Michael's to around 10 miles downstream where the river empties into the sea at Morecambe Bay, with patrol and rescue boats spotted in the area.
East Germany's last communist leader dies at 95
BERLIN (AP) - Hans Modrow, who served as East Germany's last communist leader during a turbulent tenure that ended in the country's first and only free election, has died.
He was 95.
Modrow died early Saturday, the Left party parliamentary group tweeted.
Modrow, a reform-minded communist, took over East Germany shortly after the Berlin Wall fell and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the gathering momentum for German reunification.
"The entire peaceful course of establishing German unity was precisely a special achievement of his," the Left wrote on Twitter."That will remain his political legacy."
During 16 years as communist party chief in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure.
He rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.
A post in East Germany's top leadership eluded him until he was made prime minister, a position that previously carried little clout, in November 1989 - days after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
When hard-line leader Egon Krenz and his ruling Politburo resigned in early December, Modrow emerged as East Germany's top political figure.
But the communists could no longer call the shots on their own.
The following month, he agreed to share power with the increasingly vocal opposition and moved up East Germany's landmark first free election to March 1990, amid growing unrest.
Even as pro-democracy rallies rapidly took on a pro-unification flavor, the communists initially had opposed talk of reunification.
In February 1990, however, Modrow urged talks with West Germany toward an eventual "united fatherland" that would be independent of military blocs and governed by a joint parliament in Berlin.
Modrow headed the election campaign of the restyled communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, but his personal popularity was not enough to prevent them finishing as only the third-strongest party, with 16 percent support.
The winner was an alliance of conservative parties that favored quick reunification and was backed by the government of West German leader Helmut Kohl.
Germany reunited under Kohl's leadership and as a NATO member on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Modrow became a member of the united parliament, where he sat until 1994, and honorary chairman of the post-communist PDS - the predecessor of today's opposition Left party. From 1999 to 2004, he was a member of the European Parliament.
Modrow's past under hard-line communist rule landed him in court several years after reunification.
In 1995, a court convicted him of inciting the falsification of results in May 1989 local elections in Dresden.
It handed him a nine-month suspended sentence and a fine.
Modrow claimed that the trial was politically motivated and asserted that its outcome would aggravate divisions between east and west Germans.
His attorney argued that he had made amends for previous injustices by overseeing free elections as prime minister.
Later in life, Modrow served on the council of elders of the Left party.
"Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left party parliamentary group.
"Until old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
Indian govt withdraws appeal to hug cows on Valentine's Day after criticism
Hugging a cow on Valentine's Day is no longer being encouraged by the Indian government - despite it previously asking people to do so to promote Hindu values.
The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) retracted its "Cow Hug Day" appeal after it attracted criticism from political rivals and social media users.
The Indian government department had called on citizens to deviate from Western romantic gestures celebrated on Valentine's Day.
Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, said the call to hug cows had been "absolutely crazy, defying logic."
He added that the decision to withdraw the appeal was more "to prevent the politics of Hindutva [Hindu nationalism] from being ridiculed in the face of severe criticism from all quarters."
The AWBI reneged on its appeal on Friday saying it "stands withdrawn."
It was only on Wednesday when its statement read that "hugging cows [would] bring emotional richness and increase individual and collective happiness."
More on India
It added that the cow is the "backbone of Indian culture and rural economy... because of its nourishing nature like [a] mother."
There were mixed reactions to the initial announcement as some posted videos of cows rejecting being hugged and charging off.
Others wanted to clarify that the appeal was more for following one's own culture, as opposed to "blindly" following Western values.
Young Indians typically spend Valentine's Day crowding parks and restaurants, exchanging gifts and holding parties.
Cow cuddling is nothing new either - with it being considered therapeutic in parts of the world, and in The Netherlands where it is known as "koe knuffelen."
Devout Hindus worship the cow - known as gau mata, or "mother cow" - and most states in India have banned cow slaughter.
In recent years, certain Hindu hard-liners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day goes against traditional values and promotes promiscuity.
Hindu nationalist groups such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have said such raids help reassert a Hindu identity.
Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda, seeking the religion's supremacy in a secular nation known for its diversity.
While Hindus comprise almost 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for most of the rest.
Pedestrian dies in hospital after crash with car in Cowdenbeath as man arrested
A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife.
The 38-year-old female was rushed to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy following the crash on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath on Friday around 1.30pm.
A 24-year-old man has subsequently been arrested in connection with the crash.
Police are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dash-cam footage to come forward.
Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and who witnessed the crash to get in touch."
I would also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area and who may have dash-cam footage which could assist our investigation to contact us.
"Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."
IN NUMBERS: The Oslo boroughs where the most foreigners live
Roughly 177,000 of Oslo's 634,000's residents have immigrated to Norway from other countries.
When you include those born in Oslo to foreign parents, the proportion of those who are immigrants or have an immigrant background rises to more than a third.
In Oslo, citizens from Asia, including Turkey, made up the largest immigrant group, with over 62,985 of these nationals living in the city, according to figures from the national data agency Statistics Norway (SSB).
After that, citizens from the EU, EEA and the UK made up the second largest group, accounting for not far off 10 percent of the city's population.
Africans made up the third largest group of immigrants in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo.
Europeans from countries that aren't part of the UK, EU or EEA were the fourth largest group, accounting for 15,566 Oslo residents.
From here, the size of the groups drops significantly.
For example, there were just shy of 7,000 citizens from South American countries in 2022, while there was a smidge over 3,000 nationals hailing from North and Central America.
Meanwhile, there were less than 700 people from Oceania in Oslo.
Alna, in the northeast of the city, was the borough with the most foreign residents.
Some 18,257 foreign residents were registered as living there in 2022.
Afterwards, trendy Grünerløkka, located reasonably centrally, had the second highest number of foreign residents, with 17,631.
Gamle Oslo also had a significant immigrant population, with 17,631 people living there after moving from another country.
Statistics Norway's figures showed that foreigners were scattered all over the city's districts, as Søndre Nordstrand, the borough furthest south in Oslo, had over 14,000 immigrants registered there.
Many immigrants also lived in sought-after areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth most foreigners.
After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene made up the rest of the ten districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country.
At the other end of the spectrum, just 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the city's central borough.
Ullern, Vestre Aker and Nordstrand made up the other boroughs with the fewest foreign residents.
However, these boroughs had significantly more immigrants living there than in central Oslo and Marka.
Those from EU and EEA countries and those from the United Kingdom mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo and St. Hanshaugen.
Meanwhile, while plenty of citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also resided in Game Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered as living in the boroughs of Alna, Stovner and Søndre Nordstrand.
Gamle Oslo and Alna were the two parts of the city where the largest number of immigrants from Africa lived, along with Stovner, Grünerløkka and Søndre Norstrand.
Those from North America were spread fairly evenly across Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, Vestre Aker and Nordre Aker.
Citizens from South and Central America were most commonly found in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo St.Hanshaugen and Sagene.
Europeans from outside the EU, EEA and UK tended to live in the town's most central borough, Ullern, Vestre Aker, Nordre Aker and Stovner.
And finally, of the several hundred nationals from Oceania, Frogner, Grünerløkka and Gamle Oslo were the boroughs with the highest populations of these nationals.
Zimbabwe to Start Operating New Coal Power Unit by March
By Florence Tan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will start operating a new unit at its only coal-fired power plant by March, says the country's deputy energy minister, providing relief to millions of citizens rocked by frequent power outages in recent months.
The new unit of the Hwange power plant will lift the African nation's installed capacity by more than 14% to 2400 megawatts.
The next unit is expected to be commissioned soon after, Magna Mudyiwa said, without giving a timeline.
Less than half of Zimbabwe's 16 million citizens have access to electricity, and a global squeeze on funding new coal-fired capacity has limited the country's ability to plug chronic power cuts that have lasted as long as 18 hours in recent days.
"We have the capacity to generate up to 2100 megawatts (MW) from our power sources but at the moment we're generating far less than that..about 1000MW," Mudyiwa told Reuters.
"But our demand for electricity is about 1700MW so we have a serious deficit," she said.
Deficient rainfall has led to a decline in hydropower generation, while the efficiency of the sole, decades-old coal-fired utility has dipped sharply over time while power demand has surged in recent years due to higher mining and agricultural activity.
The International Monetary Fund counts electricity shortages as one of the major factors weighing on Zimbabwe's growth prospects.
Lack of funding for coal-fired power is driving the mining and agriculture-dependent economy to import costly power from regional neighbors including Zambia and Mozambique.

(PERSON11) But for some folders, for some reason, the audio format is wrong, so, something is wrongly –
Basically, the big trade, or something is wrong.
So, some files are still – still have weird output.
But – but for most folders, it should be already fine.
(PERSON1) Okay, thanks.
(PERSON6) Yeah, that's great.
I support this, it's great that, [PERSON7], you have thought of [PERSON11].
And [PERSON11] now has the time.
There are other things where I was thinking of [PERSON11] and that would be training of, empty systems, so that they do the shortening.
So, if you, [PERSON11], had the time.
Obviously, there is no way we could do it for next week.
But we should really have the system – ready for –
I looked at the tutorial from the NLP – was it?
(PERSON6) For the upcoming sessions and I've asked about demand because I've seen the (meme) project demo.
They do offline subtitling.
So, that's slightly easier than what we do.
They still have the same segmentation issues and so on.
But their mission in translation is shortening simply because the data is shortening.
And that's because their target size is the subtitles, which are created for the hearing-impaired.
So, there is like a natural shortening in the data.
It'd be great if we could also locate such a type of data where there is some natural shortening happening.
We would put it in the architecture.
(PERSON8) That takes a bit of time, because I need to figure out which one is the one which is getting passes.
So, once I know that, I can keep a track of it, so, for the future –
Or actually, for future I would not need it, because once I have the web file, I probably won't need to do a convert.
(PERSON6) Well, this, this should actually be –
Can you still hear me?
The sound quality is a little worse.
So, this should really be done, all the time.
So, every time we run this evaluation, it should be run from scratch.
So, every time, there should be a fresh download of a fresh conversion and a fresh evaluation.
(PERSON8) But still, if I am keeping track of the files that need to be manually converted, so that I can write a script, and it could take care of the known ones at least, and of course, if we add some new files, I can see for that later.
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have come across months ago.
Remember, it is since August that I've been telling you that we want to evaluate on a later test set.
And every time, you all...
It is not just you personally, [PERSON8].
There were other things, obviously.
But every time you thought about that, you thought "this will be easy, we will just run it".
And only when you actually do it, do you see all the problems.
So, this is known, common.
It is always like that.
So that's a message for everybody.
Before you try, you never know what the problem will be.
So, for example, the call that I had, in which someone was interviewing me, so they wanted to record the video.
Zoom never worked as badly for me as it did today for the recording.
So, before you do it, you cannot say whether it will work or not.
And here we are running into the problems of conversion of the file formats.
So, hopefully, we will be able to quickly get the numbers.
So, do you have any word error rates so far?
(PERSON8) No, I have not processed it.
So [PERSON1] said that, once, they get the transcript, we will do it together.
And then, I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary.
So, I asked that you would have various versions of this dictionary by taking only the words that were observed, five times.
And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that.
So, that way, these random errors, such as the example with this four IBM instead of IBM.
This will not be so frequent.
But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person, says this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the in the talk, then you will see that in the data with the "Z".
And if he sometimes manages to say also correctly, then yeah, again, you will see that in the data.
So, I would like, [PERSON4] to be in touch with [PERSON2].
Maybe you continue on the call, right?
I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids lunch and so on.
But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary.
So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system is accepting.
Share your screen and show it.
And [PERSON2], please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file.
One thing that will still be needed is the language model substitute.
But all these words should be known words.
So [PERSON4], you need to figure out what words are in the language model.
And the words which are in the language model should be simply copied.
So, the dictionary will have three col ns.
The grapheme, as it is output.
One recognized.
The phonemes, as [PERSON2] proposed.
And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations.
And the third col n will be also the same again for all of those, and again there will be the same grapheme form.
So that is when the language model sees.
And I think that this way, these systems should be able to load it.
And you will also possibly run into one more problem: that it is not ready for two big custom dictionaries.
So, this is also something that has to be tested, but please test it, the two of you together.
So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary.
And you know what the dictionary looks like when you are creating it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together.
Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON6) So [PERSON2], does this make sense?
(PERSON2) Yeah, sure, we'll discuss it.
(PERSON6) Yeah, so is there anything else, [PERSON2], that you have?
(PERSON2) Well, maybe interesting information for Dominik.
I'm finishing training of a German ASR that may be used for time stamping.
I'm not sure how good it will be because I'm trying to do it on (Libry) Speech.
And, though, when I was downloading it, they claimed it had more than 600 hours.
But then the training said that the actual training set contained only around 300 hours.
And I'm still not sure whether these 300 hours do not contain similar sentences.
Or actually the same sentences but spoken by different speakers.
For example, in English or Czech I used to observe steeper conversions.
And now it won't convert so fast.
So, if we take some samples during the training.
Then there are still some serious errors in the ASR output.
So, I'm hopeful that for the time stamping, it is good enough.
Or at least we might try it.
(PERSON17) Okay, that's good, yeah.
So, I started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you reminded me, [PERSON8], that your profanity filtering is not yet integrated.
And I think this is also an important message for [PERSON5], who has disappeared again from the call.
So, the important message is that yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated, and everybody should do so.
And at the same time, we need to have the setup, so that you can actually integrate and test it yourself.
So, I call it "do-it-yourself integration".
So, [PERSON8], when working with [PERSON5] and when documenting what the setups are, make sure it is tested well enough by colleagues, such as [PERSON4] or even [PERSON9] for the language model checks and everybody else.
So, whenever someone develops a new useful component, the full pipeline should be accessible to him reasonably easily, so he can test it himself.
So, this do-it-yourself integration is important, because otherwise it will all remain on you, [PERSON8], and you don't want to be overloaded.
So, you want to provide these people with inputs and outputs as the first testing approach, which has already been done.
[PERSON4], right?
The profanity filtering, has it been tested on logs?
I think it was.
(PERSON8) Yeah, it was tested on logs, I think.
So, now it's time to test it on the live pipelines.
And again, I think it's better if [PERSON8] explains to [PERSON4] how to do it, so that [PERSON4] runs it for himself some of the workers and live playing some of the problematic file like using [PROJECT8] or whatever.
Simply play them.
Follow the sound output on your machine and see how that works.
Because only when doing the real setup will the true errors appear.
It is important to first debug it, using the log files, and then it's important to debug it in the pipeline.
And if this debugging can be done by the author of that component, here, in this case [PERSON4], it would be most efficient for all of us.
So, [PERSON8], please confirm that you agree with this idea of like do-it-yourself integration.
(PERSON17) Yeah, so for the multi-accent English.
So, we are now [PERSON14] putting that together to just one technical solution.
The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers.
So, it will be really multi-speaker sentences, and therefore the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved.
Ah, so that's one particle experiment.
And later on, we may do something more about the multi-accent thing.
So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment.
One problem is the implicit language model.
So, the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences.
And we are going to create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part to that, so that the language model will be better for the ASR, and the robustness to different speakers would be also better.
And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea.
It was during the training.
They were dropping out time bands and frequency bands from the sound.
So, they were training on disrupted inputs, and that also greatly improved the robustness of the system.
(PERSON17) Anyone else can work on the non-native accent thing.
Ok, then another thing that I spotted is - this is in the Monday test document.
It is highlighted four times.
So, when some session is happening, we need the names and terminology for that session.
And we need to collect it, prepare it manually, create it somewhat.
And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible.
So, there is a certain skill b in that, which needs to be practiced.
So, I'm quite skilled at shuffling text files.
And whenever I see any of any of you doing that, then I like always have tips in my head of what could be done faster.
Maybe it is not faster for your end, but at least you should consider it.
So there this skill is something that that we need people to have.
And we need someone to be responsible for that.
And I'm afraid that the only person for this could be [PERSON8].
If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation, the data crunching, please say so.
And then we need -
So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations, we need techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems.
So, my impression from the domain adaptation that [PERSON9] has been carefully doing for all the sessions was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR.
So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday.
[PERSON9] is already starting the data collection, but I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in in in the [PROJECT5] set up.
So, maybe [PERSON9] and [PERSON8], because he's learning how to do domain adaptation and [PERSON14], because he is doing how to work with [PROJECT5].
If you three could meet and double check what is [PROJECT5] doing with the -
It's not [PROJECT5], actually, the domain adaptation is for the [PERSON18] toolkit, right.
So, this is kind of backward-looking, making sure that the old approach works.
At the moment it is absolutely impossible to do any domain adaptation for the fully neural ASR.
So, what I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting from sound and some merging procedure.
So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time.
End-to-end ASR, which is better in general.
And then domain-adapted [PROJECT5] setup, which is used only to spot the keywords.
And when we see a keyword in the domain-adapted version then we would then we would use that sentence from [PROJECT5], which is in general worse, but contains the right terms.
So that's my suggestion of what we could do.
And another suggestion is that we really should have our own fully neural ASR and do various experiments on finetuning and all that.
So, we have discussed this with [PERSON14].
And, [PERSON14], is there any update from the potential colleague or friend of yours?
(PERSON17) Yeah, so if there is anyone else who'd be curious about this please let me know or get in touch.
So, it's this is something which is which would really be accepted well in generally as a as a paper, because people don't do that yet.
And that's the most urgent problem these days.
So, we really could make an impact there.
(PERSON6) Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about like what kinds of data we currently use for this, because, for example, like if you check like [ORGANIZATION4]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5] that they are like already pretty good at these things -
(PERSON6) And I think that if we just like -
We could probably just get the data from them, because you have like a such a large set of videos basically with different domains and different speaker native languages on [ORGANIZATION5].
And I had this idea that we could just like use some tool to download basically some kinds of filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make training tests a training set out of them.
So, I plan to do it myself.
I plan to go there, but we need a backup person.
And also, for the [PROJEC210] event we need someone to take care of the recording,
So, the archiver person, so that we don't lose that session again.
And the more important and still persisting topic to work on is ladder climbing.
And I've suggested here in the paragraph for [PERSON2] that we could use simple html tables that would be autogenerated and that that would grow.
I think that that would be probably the easiest to just put up the tables as html, but it could get difficult when we want to see the differences, as new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign.
It may be difficult to prepare these tables.
So, I asked [PERSON7] and [PERSON7] unfortunately won't be available during this call.
To tell us whether [ORGANISATION242], which is a web-based solution.
Some start-up company which offers accounts for academic purposes for free.
If that would help us or not.
Okay, so [ORGANISATION242] is not recommended by [PERSON7].
So, simple html is probably the way to go.
So, as soon as [PERSON2] has these evaluations m cleaned up.
So, that means moving the few scripts to where they belong from [PROJECT3] test set and some automatic runner.
Then also please create a conversion from the tables into html similar to the tech conversion and then put these results regularly to your webpage.
Or what you could even do is to have a full git check out directly located in this public html or singling from that public html.
So that it would be immediately accessible through the web, and anybody could have a look at the current scorings and explore that.
So, this would be useful, especially for m people outside of [ORGANISATION2] such as, [ORGANISATION15].
We know they have like -
The performance was bad for some of the files, and they could directly m browse it on the web m.
They could also browse it actually in on [ORGANISATION101].
This is up to you to set it up so that it's user-friendly and easy to follow.
(PERSON2) Okay, I'll do that.
(PERSON11) Yeah, thanks.
I'm now working on, or getting to update, the demo paper submission, which is due next Friday, if I'm not mistaken.
And then I have some project reports to do and I'm starting to gather documents - like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, for the two sessions.
(PERSON11) <parallel_talk> For ASR as well we should add a complimentary metric -
Actually more, we should add complementary met- these complementary metrics. </parallel_talk>
So, you mentioned one and that is profanity filtering m evaluation.
So <parallel_talk> have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output </parallel_talk>, right?
<parallel_talk> And then rare words evaluation.
And here have an explicit list of names and terms that we do want to appear in the output, scored not simply by (order) rate </parallel_talk> but scored by something which directly accounts these things, right?
Yes, so I totally agree.
This involves also manual preparation of the reference.
So, <parallel_talk> both need manually created references. </parallel_talk>
I have one remark from [PERSON1].
So <parallel_talk> [PERSON1] has compiled some translation dictionary.
And she should share it soon. </parallel_talk>
So, this could become an empty part of the second thing of the rare word -
So <parallel_talk> this would be the rare word evaluation for MT and then from [PROJEC210] we are also likely to get some dictionary. </parallel_talk>
So that would be the [PROJEC210] domain obviously.
And [PERSON2], could I ask you to revise the <unintelligible/> domain and create such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs.
So, like shortlisting - listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the <unintelligible/> domain.
Could you do that?
(PERSON11) It should be doable, so let's give it a try.
It would be like - it would be great if you managed to do that.
So, I'll write it down.
So, <parallel_talk> aiming towards [ORGANISATION62] deadline with subtitler study paper. </parallel_talk>
Yes <parallel_talk> and then then a multi-source with [PERSON7] or based upon [PERSON7] or - </parallel_talk>
And for the language ID, I'm curious how do you want to integrate it exactly because it already involves considering multiple ASR sources, multiple channels, so what would be the use case for the for the language ID?
How do we plug that in?
(PERSON13) It will be audio to text worker, and it will emit time stamps like for four or two second window and the class.
<unintelligible/> silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it in the pipeline.
(PERSON11) That is important.
Please write this down here into the documenter this <unintelligible/> summary, because that is for [PERSON2].
And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well and also possibly [PERSON5].
If we have this tool, we need to (ship) the audio to multiple ASR or multiple workers <unintelligible/>
We will separately need to (ship) the audio to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other_noise/>
And also, to this language ID worker and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is tool which we do not have yet.
That's the multi-source tool, which will be observing the text outputs and also following the time stamps and it would emit the - it would probably like produce the output into three separate language channels for using either silence or the correct ASR.
So, we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent if it's the wrong language and it is the recognized text if it's the correct language.
I just made it up this type of setup.
Another of setup would be that same sound is shipped to ASR and this language checker.
This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR, silencing the ASR if it's the wrong language.
That's also an option.
So, we need to figure out which way of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes.
So, please keep thinking about this like what are our pipelines.
Ideally, I think that the least like management confusion and so on would arise if our MT models were multilingual.
If they supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages into English.
Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input, so we would have multi-lingual multiple ASRs at the beginning.
All going into English, and then from the English will go into all of the languages.
And later when [PERSON12] would have multi-lingual model of ASR, that language ID would not even be needed.
(PERSON3) The thing is, as long as we do the analysis more properly, one thing is the possible adversarial evaluation, just to indicate that that the constraints are actually having an impact on the actual output.
That that would be nice and yeah possibly the attention analysis.
But I'm not sure it might give us the same answers, basically, if the if the model attends or does not attend to the constraint.
(PERSON4) I had to look just at a few examples of attention, I did not do any statistics or anything, and it looks at the constraints, and when it translates the constraints, it looks like the constraints given, and I think it would be useful if the system made any errors, but it in fact does not do any in that sense.
It makes some general translation errors but not the (phenomena) we are trying to solve.
Well, going back to the automatic evaluation, the problem with mismatch is that the output is correctly inflected, but the context is different.
Therefore, it is not the same word form as in reference, right?
(PERSON4) Yeah, but I have also checked if the contexts are valid translations and in most cases they are.
Like in the first 100 examples that were marked as error by automatic evaluation 91 of them were correctly inflected in correct contexts.
(PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the incorrect context, like the translation was wrong.
And then there are some cases where the translation was totally wrong, because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be <unintelligible/>, but that was just like one or two cases.
(PERSON3) But you are trying to match the divert forms when you are evaluating it, right?
You do not do any-
(PERSON3) -lemmatization of the reference and the-
(PERSON4) Both, both, both, I'm matching both the surface forms and lemma.
(PERSON3) Oh I see, oh yeah, those are the two scores, right?
(PERSON4) It is just the dilemma score for the (European?) is not in the table because of the table like won't fit into the paper so <unintelligible/>
Coverage is always like 97 percent.
It just generates the correct lemmas, just-
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, okay, I get it, I get it.
So basically, the lemma coverage says whether the constraint is there, and the surface coverage difference suggests that it might be incorrectly inflected, but that is not the case.
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, just I do not know if you if you, if you catch <unintelligible/> when we were talking about [PERSON1],
but one thing, is, that, that the (blow) is better but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually properly inflected manually,
but that is that is another, no, no problem, it is actually good that is <unintelligible/> right, yeah.
So, I was thinking there might be.
But I'm not sure whether we have some test data for that, but we might try to play around with the models with some sort of style transfer?
As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how, how, what is the difference between the outputs.
But this is, like I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself do not have an exact idea how to do it, but it might have been an interesting, distinct scenario.
I do not know, [PERSON1], do you know about any style transfer data for English Czech? Do we have something?
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) By style transfer, Dusan, you mean that there would be something which is in the written language, and you would be the target side, would be in the spoken language or something like that?
(PERSON3) Well, that is the thing like, I have only a limited knowledge about the task.
But I can imagine that you want to rewrite a sentence that it is not written by male, but it is written by a female instead or, I do not know, like you can have a scientific and unscientific explanation of certain phenomena.
I'm not really that familiar with the exact data sets and what they cover.
And the idea is that the style of the sentences gets quite vaguely defined.
So again, not so sure.
(PERSON1) We have this corpus of sentence transformations.
And one thing that is there and could be labelled as style transfer is for example, making the sentences more general.
So, details are omitted, the sentence is simplified, and then making the sentence sound colloquial.
Well, just a paraphrase.
And I'm not sure if we have anything like shortening of the sentence.
For shortening, Matous is doing some experiment with English–Czech, but we do not have any reference data there.
So, we do not have any sentence compression dataset.
So maybe the generalization could be of interest but I'm afraid that there are too many different good generalizations, so the single reference one would be too limited to tell you anything about the quality of your generalization.
And I'm not aware of any like gender transformations, for example, this could be done <unintelligible/> for Czech, so maybe the right person would be Rudolf Rosa to ask him if he has ever generated any such dataset.
So, there will be a root-based generation of some sentence counterpart.
(PERSON3) I guess that is actually like an interesting question whether we can use the constraints to enforce this kind of the like gender of the speaker in the in the translation.
(PERSON1) That is actually a very good idea.
So, we could focus on that and create a particular sub-part of [PROJECT1] test set that would cover that.
Ah so that we sometimes we know the gender of the speaker so if you are...  maybe I'll share the screen and browse that.
(PERSON8) Or I tried it with Marian just attending it and it's... I don't know how many BLEU points lower.
(PERSON2) Because like the way I believe Martin does his <unintelligible/> little translation, so he translates more sentences at once and then picks only the centre one and goes like this for the whole document.
So, the context is like in one <unintelligible/> together with sentence we actually want to translate.
(PERSON10) Yeah, I think - wasn't it Dominik doing some experiments with Ivana?
I think the last year or two years ago for double empty where they were attending the context or concatenating the context with input sentence and doing some sort of document level translation.
But the thing is with this with the concatenation is not completely sure whether it has the same effect as we do multi encoder setting-
(PERSON1) Like everybody is different, it's definitely a different calculation, different leader, but it's I'm surprised that [PERSON8] says that it doesn't work full stop.
(PERSON8) Yeah, okay, so sorry, maybe I should be more correct that it didn't work like in the way I did it <laugh/>
(PERSON1) Yeah, because I think it's a method which is very easy to test, and it always should be tested in contrast with the two encoders, and I would expect sometimes to be better and sometimes to be worse than the two encoders set up, depending on the exact task like what exactly is the second thing that you are encoding.
So, maybe if you have two copies two paraphrases of the same sentence,
maybe it is somehow confusing for the attention so whatever, I don't know.
Behaviour also could be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods, compared to transformer, so for RNN then it behaved differently maybe with transformer it's yeah, it's harder to train so maybe you need to whatever increase warm-ups number, warm-up sets.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so just know like-
(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly but this is like what-
when I started in summer with those multi-source experiments.
The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and source and maybe I, I don't remember now,
I can check it till the next meeting whether I tried also,
I definitely tried when the sources are on the first position then some delimiter and the paraphrase on the second position.
I might have also tried that I shuffled the two things randomly, yeah, and I just remember that it did abundantly this compenetration stuff and tried multi-encoders.
(PERSON8) And it was probably due to low scores.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> that you like can improve your amenity score by just appending phrase-based output and the attention is like double diagonal, so the attention is not an issue, so like I believe you but it's surprising that it didn't work.
(PERSON10) So, if you if you input the phrase-based output that's basically post editing, right? You can think about it as a postediting like you are postediting phrase-based output, right? Or like depends on the point of view, right?
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> that you like fully to rewrite it but technically it fits exactly the postediting task, you can plug this as a solution to the postediting task.
(PERSON10) Okay, so one question just for me just to make sure in the concatenation settings you insert the sentence separator token, right?
You have a special token to distinguish like which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence or do you just concatenate them without anything?
And hope that the system learns it?
(PERSON8) I tried to, I guess two tokens and yeah like because in the first version, we had a suspicion that the token could be also tokenized itself, so then I replayed it with another token which is not only for this purpose because we used some pretrained dictionary, and this dictionary didn't contain separator tokens.
So, I used some token that I assumed that it wouldn't be like tokenized into several pieces and so it will appear once.
I had no guarantee that this token couldn't appear in other places in the sentence and that is the only place it could appear.
So, it could be done more properly, yeah, I agree.
(PERSON2) But the Flask part or the communication part with the client is something that I cannot do.
Because I have no experience and no time to get it running.
(PERSON1) I thought it meant something using I don't know mediator.
(PERSON2) No, make a HTTP client which can fill the queue and read from another queue.
And send the text back in a HTTP request.
Because my idea is that the user clicks be used in the Ukrainian project too.
(PERSON2) And my idea is that a client clicks this microphone button and starts to speak, and when the user is speaking, you send the audio in small chunks at the same time.
Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds.
And to the HTTP server put it to a queue which I will handle the queue later with (ASR).
And the model will do some logic, some inference with that.
And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should get the partial transcript back.
And it should be immediately displayed in the text field.
(PERSON1) I could think about that.
Just I don't really know Flask either, but yeah, I can think about that.
(PERSON2) Oh maybe a different HTTP server.
I don't know, maybe we don't even need a fancy HTTP server for that.
(PERSON1) I mean for text flow, we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
(PERSON2) Yeah, the only requirement is that it should handle more connection at a time.
(PERSON1) Well I think online text flow is something around 2 000 at least.
(PERSON1) I mean the script that I have in two different folders, and then will run it with the little different inside workers, so that I mean, yeah, so that I have <unintelligible/> let's say ten, well instead of an output, a file by a <unintelligible/> side worker, so <unintelligible/> that we have, so I'll just make sure that these things for a single file are getting generated parallelly from all the available workers.
(PERSON1) Oh that would save our time.
(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, this is very important to parallelize everything actually, parallelize both the processing of the systems as well as the evaluation of the cell DF, because he would need to run this many times, there will be errors, you need to re-run this quickly.
(PERSON7) Okay, so thanks.
So, you are very busy with this, I don't want to put any other things on you, so let me start with the reminders.
We need to finish the description of [PROJECT1] desk set,
Who do we have here?
Oh well, not really, yeah, (it's done) and it's not here unfortunately.
So, this would be for [PERSON2],
Then the evaluation, this is for [PERSON1], but we have discussed this.
Listen, give me the table in DSD let's put the fine line here and push the template of the table, like the plan structure into the delebl now, so that the numbers will come later, but I want to see some numbers and the full structure of the table very soon.
(PERSON7) Okay, thank you.
We have [PERSON5], that's good.
So, for [PERSON5], I would like to check what is the progress in the evaluation of the systems, and whether you are in touch with [PERSON1] also for the evolution, which is more important.
Can you hear us, [PERSON5]?
(PERSON1) and then, we'll figure out which packages to install in the Petri environment.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so there's another thing,
Maybe it's not a good idea to combine these two runs into one setup.
I think it is actually better if you run it separately and save the outputs.
So, you first use the environment for cruise control and the processing,
(PERSON7) and you collect all the output files, and then you run the evaluation.
And the reason for this split is that you can paralyze more.
So, there will be problems on various fronts, I'm sure, and we will need the numbers very soon.
So, if for example, some of the test files will fail for some reason,
Then you can still keep the translation running for the remaining ones,
and re-evaluate, with a sel T F, the missing ones, and, and so on.
So, it's, the point is not to create a serial, sequential processing that includes both,
but the point is to get the results, and it's actually better to do it in slices.
First get all outputs, then we get all evaluations.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so, I mean, right now, I was doing the same.
(PERSON2) Yes, that's the only stuff I did for positive constraints.
With the negative constraints I did something a little bit more complicated in the decoding.
Like filtering out the beams and replacing the beams with different beams.
And for like multi-token constraints and this kind of stuff.
But for the positive constraints, I only compared the training approach with yeah just this very simple stuff.
Just modifying the scores in each step in the same way.
(PERSON7) Okay, so back to the positive constraints.
Were you already focusing on the analysis of the system?
(PERSON2) Yeah, right now, I'm kind of waiting for the dataset reprocessing from ([PERSON9]).
Also [PERSON9] I had a look at the (code), and I think I know why it's so slow.
Because for each entry in the terminology in the (Europar) reprocessing, you open the dataset, tokenize it, read it line by line, tokenize it line by line and then close it.
But you only you do that -
(PERSON4) So, I remember that for [PROJECT1] I was doing this from last year from some cottage in the mountains.
And I just realized, shortly before New Year’s Eve that I need to submit it.
And <laugh/> so this is also something that will happen to [PERSON8] I'm afraid that he could be...well, no party, but maybe at the remote party.
And then suddenly he would realize that he has to submit it.
So, there will be no review of like at that point. <laugh/>
He would simply take the PDF and upload it so. <laugh/>
(PERSON7) Well, okay.
So, Yeah, I will check on 21st, and otherwise I will send them an e-mail.
(PERSON4) Please, I think better send them an e-mail right now and just ask for that link in advance.
(PERSON7) Okay.
(PERSON4) Yep thanks.
(PERSON7) Do we have other issues to discuss today, or is that is that everything until the New Year?
(PERSON6) I hope there wasn’t anything for me?
(PERSON3) Several years ago.
MT marathons used to have this system or tool papers that were published as a special issue of PBML.
That was in the first year when that happened.
And then, in the subsequent years, it was integrated with normal like there were also PBML issues which mixed empty margin papers and separate papers because of the number of those papers.
And we even had a thing like if the paper was not good enough for the PBML, but if the tool was presented at the MT marathon.
The authors were invited to submit for another review for one for the next PBML issue.
So, we have, even as I said, your system, your tool is interesting.
Please publish it at the MT marathon among the people.
But your paper is too bad.
You need to improve it, and you will get only to the next PBML.
(PERSON4) Yes, but another possibility for SIGDial.
Isn't it possible that trying SIGDial we attract kind of better participants.
(PERSON3) That's yes, that is... like I thought that I also had, but I don't know either of the venues.
They have final paper registration in July.
So, the conference was in September, and the paper submission was in May.
Because for Interspeech, we could also like split it paper by paper.
So that some papers would go to the Interspeech proceedings.
And some of our submission papers would come later for the PBML proceedings.
And the authors would be free to choose.
So that we have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech.
If it is okay for them to have some of our papers, given that these papers are submitted by the March deadline.
So, there is an absolute strict requirement.
And I think it's they cannot have anything against it.
Because if the paper is worth publishing.
Like, it's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event.
So yeah, I think it's okay.
So, we do not need to ask for a special session.
In Interspeech it is called special session, we don't want that.
In Interspeech we want the satellite event.
But we will tell our people.
If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech.
Ah, if you do not, ah, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline.
And that is for PBML.
(PERSON7) Ah, okay.
But the thing is like for Interspeech satellite event.
Erm, Interspeech like won't get into any proceedings.
(PERSON2) You can I think you can just you can just reserve the whole semester just for [PERSON9]'s courses and you will have a lot of work and no free time, even though you have just one subject.
But I think it's a different thing, because I think it's not really a thing to fail his courses.
Like to fail because you are unable to finish it.
Of course, like people are just giving up, but I mean it's maybe for different reason that just it's impossible to pass.
I think that it's definitely possible, but it's a lot of work.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I think that he told us in the beginning of the semester that well if we want a one (??) you'll get a one.
Just within the second deadline, you should submit it.
That's pretty much the only thing he asked.
But he also told us that judging by previous years' trends, a lot of people don't do that.
They find it easier to read for the exam.
No, sorry, study for the exam-
(PERSON2) Yeah because well in general, his exams are rather easy.
(PERSON2) So I wouldn't say it's super easy, because there are some courses where the exam is like fun.
(PERSON1) Oh well, one of them was yesterday for me.
(PERSON2) Yeah, when it has short context and because I make decisions based on very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that in, for example, a second or two, it figures out oh, well, actually this was bad translation.
So, it tries to use a different wording.
To, for example, specify the thing.
So actually, I really liked it.
I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, even though you could see that the model made mistakes on its first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction.
And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is also important.
If you really demand low latency, then then I think that even a slightly lower quality is fine, if the fluency is good.
Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think that the translation is just pointless.
But if the lower quality is because the translation, if you read everything that you will get the same information, but the wording is just poor, because it used, for example, more words and it used some corrections and stuff.
So, I think that this is completely fine for simultaneous, as long as you don't lose any information.
And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples?
Because I would like to look at it, just out of curiosity.
(PERSON2) Oh definitely, I can dump you my logs.
(PERSON7) But in which languages?
Because you know I don't speak German.
(PERSON2) English and German.
(PERSON7) Yeah, but I don't necessarily speak German <laugh/>.
(PERSON2) Then I can provide English–Chinese and English–Japanese if it helps <laugh/>.
(PERSON2) So again, I mean to make it humanly readable.
Because this flickering is really annoying and then you lose focus on what was actually said, because maybe this is also a question of someone who knows more about the human brain and how we work with information.
Sorry, I never thought about it in depth.
But I think that whenever I see a word, I put it into my memory and my memory is not a linear thing, but it's more like a bag.
So, I put a word into a bag.
And I like to connect the things in the bag to get the overall image of the word.
And I think that that's the problem with the flicker.
If you translate something and then you change it, then actually I read it already, it's in my brain.
And then I lose focus and control of what was actually then translated as correct and was not what was not.
So that's why I think that the whole flicker thing is bad and stupid by definition.
Like I see the motivation, like you want to display everything you have.
Even though you cannot promise it's good.
But I think that we cannot work with this extra information.
And I think that maybe the problem is that the systems are created by people working with it.
If I'm a developing a system, then I'm really crazy happy if I see that even if I don't promise the translation is correct, I still show it and it's somehow good, but I think that the developer is not really focusing on the content itself.
And how you perceive the content, but rather that, oh yeah, my system can output it really quickly.
And even though it just guesses the quality is okay-ish, I think maybe that's why the retranslation was created.
Just the developers of the systems are eager to display information, and I think that because we are limited in in like the vol e of information we can perceive some time, we like see the extra information is just an extra burden for us.
So, I think that it's not good to show extra.
Like if you want to decrease latency, then instead of flicker, just lower the quality.
I think that's still better than showing the flicker.
Because what would be the real use case?
Why would you need to see the unstable hypothesis, really?
Like from a user perspective?
(PERSON1) Like technically, when human translators start translating, I mean the goal even there is for annotators, they would try to follow the speech string of the original speaker.
So, there are times when they would say something, and that would be wrong, so they would just correct themselves.
(PERSON2) Well but yeah this means with my solution, like you would not do flicker, but you committed, like there is no way to change, but you correct yourself.
And that's actually what the translators are doing.
(PERSON3) I'm strongly feeling that our work is not exactly in the domain of speech, it is unhealthy.
Because there is no concept of speech here.
We are directly working on text.
But the thing is that the proposal for a statistical workshop this year is over, which was in September, which was too early for us.
And the next proposal would come for 2022, which would be too late for us.
It is better that if we get either of the two sectile or interspeech, because both of them are well recognized in the community.
We can motivate participants to submit.
Ah, the only the only caveat that I'm finding now is going with interspeech is like they won't allow us a space in the proceedings, which may deter some of the participants, I am not sure how much they will be excited to publish a paper in archive.
So, in archives, people can publish any time, right?
So that is not a benefit to their profiles.
So how to motivate participants to join our shared task.
So, this was the reason that I especially vouched for the special session.
But this time, the problem is, what I can understand is the last time, the time periods between proposals, submission and final paper submission was five months, so it would have been enough time for our schedule, but this time.
It is only three months.
So, I see this fair as an important possible source of non-native English speech that we can use to extend the test set.
So, I think we really should focus on the Clearest voice competition, and we can do the booth if we have to.
But I would like to limit that, because the dissemination into high school students is less of an impact for us.
It is more important to use it as a test session.
So, we should focus, [PERSON1], on the [PROJECT2] Clearest voice, and keeping the organizers happy so that we can do the data gathering there.
And do whatever they want us to do in exchange for that, and we need to check their plenary program, and what type of subtitling would be useful for that plenary program.
so that would make it a test session for us, and as for our own presence at this fair, I don't think it's too important.
So, if we are asked, if we are really expected to be there and present, then okay, but if not, then I think it's definitely good for us just to be behind the curtain and behind the scenes and do our job there.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I haven't tried to do the registration yet for that, but I think that last time, it was compulsory to have the booth.
(PERSON2) Yes. So, discuss with them what is needed so that they are happy, and they allow us to do the Clearest voice, which is the most important thing.
The test session is less of an urge.
And the booth is just something that we really could avoid, if possible.
I would have preferred them to join the sessions earlier than doing things like that.
So, we really need to practice these preparations.
With the online world, it seems that you simply j p into the session, and the work is done.
But that is not the case.
It always takes 30 minutes to get it running and properly connected.
So, we need to be there earlier.
And if some session that we are doing starts at nine, but the organizers meet at a quarter to nine.
Then we have to come at a quarter past eight already, so that we have the 30 minutes extra to make sure that everything is running and chase people.
So, this is a remark for everybody that for the management to work, please also anticipate what management might suddenly ask you to do, and that would help a little.
Another message that is very important is the recording of these important sessions.
I don't know if you have responded, I had not seen anyone providing any- any updates to the document.
Maybe I forgot to tell all of you.
I had a document about the experience from [PROJECT4]and [PROJECT5] 2020.
And the first point in this experience is that we were very bad at recording these sessions.
So, it's important for the purposes of further evaluation or analysis of what went wrong to have good recordings of these sessions.
And one aspect is to get the consents, to actually be allowed to do the recording.
And even if we try to get the consents in retrospect or whatever.
Then there is the technical aspect of the- of the recording.
And we have seen that this is so diverse and complex.
Yeah, [PERSON5] is sending that link.
I have sent it by email, I remember.
2 bad lemons in a row :(
I ordered from this company because I've bought it previous seasons and it worked great for us.
This season I bought the next size I needed.
One of the pajamas I received had a hole on the foot of the pajama.
I returned it and the company sent me a new one.
The replacement pajama my son wore one time, I put it in my washing machine just like always and the zipper broke off!
I'm so disappointed because I don't have time to be dealing with returns every few days and yet that is what is happening right now.
Just as described
This is a basic puffer coat.
If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations.
The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to "puff up" a bit.
I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me.
I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed.
However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine.
There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later.
The hood functions, but no ties on it.
The front zipper works.
There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room.
There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you).
There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT.
For the price, I think it is fine.
I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold.
I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign.
However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent).
Overall, I am pleased.
The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.
This is a very nice skirt.
The lacy pattern is classy and soft
This is a very nice skirt.
The lacy pattern is classy and soft.
It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool.
This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into.
I think this could be flattering on anyone.
I'm 5'5" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down.
Didn't work with my 1999 Buick LeSabre
Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed.
However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car.
The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob.
This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it.
There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.
Good Price for Replacement
The grill of my car was ripped off by a large something flying down the interstate so I needed a replacement.
I was afraid after reading some reviews that this wouldn't fit, but it was perfect!
I own a 2013 Corolla LE.
I didn't put it on myself--I had a guy at a body shop do it for me--but it looked really easy.
It just snapped right on in less than 5 minutes.
I gave it a 4 star for the sturdiness because it does seem pretty flimsy (time and flying debris will tell), but over all I'm very satisfied that my car no longer has a gaping maw on the front now and that the price was reasonable.
Needs improvement
Super awesome light My 5 year old absolutely loved this light It didn’t last long he got it for his birthday in January it’s February already has trouble with the buttons and doesn’t run bright with plug in eats up batteries even tried recharging batteries Super cool but needs improvement
Musical Start
The piano is great starters!
It finds your child’s inner artistic ability and musical talent.
It develops a good hand-eye coordination.
The piano isn’t only a play toy, but it actually works and allows your child to play music at an early age.
If you want your child to be a future pianist, you should try this product out!
Very worth the money!
I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes.
The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw.
I was pretty taken aback.
I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago.
Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week.
My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.
Someone screwed up the formula??
This is so weird.
In normal light it looks like I have a pink and an orange but under UV light they are the same!
I drew a pink line using a paint stick from another brand so you can see what pink should look like and know it's not just my camera.
Pink is my most used color so I'm a bit upset about this.
Red, orange, and pink are basically all orange.
No point in calling them red or pink.
The white isn't as bright as I would have hoped.
The rest of the colors are all great and I like how easily these paints wash off.
I just wits there were a pink.
I guess the purple will suffice.
works for the most part
I had bleached my whole head and then dyed over it with a black box dye a few months ago.
I then went and had highlights put in all over my head.
A few weeks later I put blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye on my hair and it would not fade out.
I used this stuff with Olaplex No. 3 and it lightened TREMENDOUSLY all over, removing the green and blue parts as well as lifting the dark box dye.
However, after a day I noticed a green tint to my hair.
Every day it gets worse and I have used the color extractor twice now, with the same results.
My hair is also getting darker where the box dye was.
This is a great product it just doesn't seem to last.
don't believe the hype
Too many five-star reviews on this novel need to be tempered by some more realistic assessments.
I tried reading it but I just found the language flat.
the "freshwater" metaphor and the many descriptions of the womb like a river and the baby like a fish seemed forced, hackneyed, and contrived.
I skipped ahead and it looked like all I was going to find was a campus drama.
I give this book 10 stars!
Excellent read!!
I absolutely loved the book!!
I’ve adopted 4 Siamese cats from Siri over the years and everyone of them were absolute loves.
Once you start to read this book, it’s hard to put down.
Funny, witty and very entertaining!!
Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!
I really Like this ring light!
It is wonderful for the price and it gets the job done!
The only issue is the light bulb heats up too fast and the light goes out, so I have to turn it off wait for a while then turn it back on.
I don't think that is supposed to happen...I don't know if I have a defective light or what, but it is a very nice ring light besides the overheating.
Confusing storyline
The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot.
Also the title doesn’t fit the story.
The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened.
I was confused at times and had to go back and re read a lot to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
Loved Collins...
It took a while to warm up to Grady
3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one.
It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her.
Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together.
Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed.
Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around.
While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves.
I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself?
To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms?
Was he delusional?!
Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc.
She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward.
I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent.
I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that.
Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her?
Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two.
She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened.
There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding.
He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end.
I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character.
The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part?
I adored, hence my rating.
If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.
He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors.
Regarding his portrayal of Churchill
Mr. Oldman has played and created many, different characters.
It is very difficult to tell it is him.
He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors.
Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done.
The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages...
The scenery and costumes were excellent.
Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position.
Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times
Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth!
I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017.
At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel.
I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel.
I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system.
March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect.
Every time I try, I get the error message.
Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit.
I followed the YouTube setup video with no success.
When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth).
Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone.
This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone!
I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection.
Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication.
I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.
Good, but would like to find something better
After a lot of research, I started using this product many years ago.
It had the least amount of harmful ingredients, and still worked okay.
However, it dries up so quickly that you end up using so much lube, which ends up costing a lot of money, as well as being too disruptive during sex.
I've just been too lazy to look for a new product, but will start looking for one that is both harmless, works well, and not too costly.
The battery life is terrible on the one I bought on Amazon.
Still can’t believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else comes close in comparison.
I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my 4th one.
Dog chewed up the first one, husband kneeled on the screen of the second one, and the third ones still working but there’s an elbow mark in the middle of the touch screen also courtesy of the hubby...bought this one as a back up and the screens great but the battery it came with holds a charge maybe for a couple days.
My original (3rd one) keeps a charge for weeks at a time and I use my remote for everything.
Broke in less than a week
I like the product it’s a nice size and color!
Unfortunately only had it a week and opened the one door and it cracked the top of the wood piece!
I’m really disappointed!
It’s all assembled and I don’t have the box anymore so how could I even think about sending it back?!
My husband did try and fix it with wood glue but sadly that didn’t work either!
The door popped right out again!!
Not too easy to assemble plus....
It’s a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult.
Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked.
I had to go out and purchase corner brackets to make sure they stayed together.
Also the glass panel doors are out of line and don’t match evenly.
This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line.
Still haven’t figured out to align them.
BAD CODE PRINTED ON THE TOP OF THE POD
I purchased these in February.
Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine.
I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem.
Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box.
I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each.
I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message.
I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine.
It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue.
Very disappointing since my return window has expired.
UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money.
Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!
Sweetener on the go.
Such a convenience!
It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets!
I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend’s house.
While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea.
Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!
Doesn't actually do any air "cleaning"
Bought this as a humidifier, the "air cleaning" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something.
As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size.
The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks.
Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up.
It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type).
It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled.
However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great.
I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly.
My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here.
As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier.
tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.
I guess it was easier to break than they thought.
I am giving this product a 3 star do to the fact when I got it in it was broken already inside.
Once I examined it I realized whoever put it in the box put it in there broken, This could have either been the manufacturers packers or for the manufacturers sake the problem could possibly be that a buyer returned the item and claimed they just didn't want it or didn't need it and Amazon possibly did not do a good enough quality check when it came back.
In all fairness the buyer couldn't have said it was broken because then Amazon wouldn't have taken it back which is good especially with this kind of product either way though I am the one who got stuck with someones negligence.
I did however get my money back so after thinking about it and discussing it with my spouse I have decided to give this buyer another chance.
With that said I will only update my rating to a higher star depending on how customer service handles this post (by at least addressing it) and if the item comes in great shape, actually has the opportunity to do what it does, and works well doing what it is supposed to do.
Easy to install?????
Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install.
I tried installing both "bells" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck.
I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells.
Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working.
After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase.
The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work.
It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly.
It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want.
One thing they ask in rating this bell is how "weatherproof" it is.
I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.
Lost package - Re-Charged me
Grew up with these and was psyched to purchase them for my son, but they lost the package of live caterpillars.
They told me they'd replace it and charge half the shipping this time.
After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount.
I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher.
I spent 30 minutes on the phone so I caved and just bought another set of caterpillars.
Whatever.
Works well after some headaches.
Had some problems getting it to work.
The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery.
When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC.
Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info.
PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case).
The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth.
Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.
... was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold
I asked the seller if the color was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold, darker.
Nothing close!
The set looks VERY cheap.
It's super shiny yellow with lots of CZs, even shinier.
Looks great on the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :(
This ring was beautiful.
I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable!
The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time.
I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing.
Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time.
This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry.
I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me.
:( Too bad because I really did love it!
So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!!
You won't be disappointed!
buy the Pampered Chef...
I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage.
I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies.
I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products.
Not this one.
At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working.
I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat.
So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop.
It's totally worth it!
Will not buy Mr. Coffee again
It was a fine coffee maker for a while, but there were always issues with it.
If you got water between the black plastic and metal on the carafe, it would leak and drain the water for days.
Then our plastic lever broke which allows the coffee to flow through the filter and into the carafe.
I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house.
It's great at making coffee and keeping it hot, but there are too many other issues with it to invest in it at the current price.
Must buy!!
I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great!
The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain.
I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars!
It was easy to clean and all came in wrapped individually which I found to be really organised and it calmed my soul lol love, love, LOVE the color and I would definitely buy this again for myself or for a loved one!
Might be good on a pole, but NOT as a hanging baffle or weather shield.
Shame on Audubon.
The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and "Make sure it is securely in place."
HOW???
It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind.
You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it.
It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug.
It is a complete PITA.
I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards.
(Let's face it; there's nothing like this which will actually "baffle" squirrels!)
I love many of the features of these lights
I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window.
I love many of the features of these lights.
Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow.
The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants.
I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights.
The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only.
I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself.
I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants.
The lights are small!
When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.
BEWARE...SMELL IS VERY BAD...CARD SLOTS TOO BIG!
When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD.
At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell.
It never went away, so I had to return it.
PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big.
The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out.
THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.
It’s very small..
Received the travel money belt and it a lot smaller than the pictures shows.
I wished I did not buy it and will still have to look for something larger.
Good umbrella, would buy it again if I had to
First off, I have to say the color is loveeeee.
A lot of things I order in purple always come too light, too kiddish, too weird, too neon-ish, what have you.
But this purple was deep and lush and I love it, the umbrella is sturdy and really good quality.
Probably best umbrella I’ve had.
Comes with a cover and while it may not have much functional use, it really keeps it looking sharp.
Packaging is terrible - received 3 damaged guitars
Very nice looking guitar.
Too bad the company does not know how to protect their product.
Don’t bother trying to receive one that is not damaged.
We returned 2 because of damages in shipping and the the 3rd one was damaged also.
Gave up.
They ship it in the soft thin case with one sheet of brown paper in a cardboard box.
No padding at all.
Cool concept!
Just needs some more improvements to make it a really awesome product
Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing.
I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests.
I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch.
It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone.
For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder.
Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out.
There's no music in the mic itself though.
It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic.
Or you can even sync your Spotify app.
Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately.
The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!)
and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room.
Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic.
If you've figured this out, I'd love to know!
2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky.
I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker.
3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting.
If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.
Ribbed off by Vision Supplies
October 2017 purchased four (4) cartridges from Vision Supplies - Amazon Marketplace, so I would have when needed and to save shipping cost.
Used two over the last couple of years, about one a year, and they worked okay.
Tried to use one last week, almost empty after printing 20 labels, but in last one ran out after 40 pages.
The plastic a missing on both.
Told warranty expired!!!!
Who would check every single cartridge when received????
BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry, what?
My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk.
I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable.
You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell?
Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this.
You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell.
My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries.
I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough.
I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients.
I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.
Drops internet
I bought this modem/router about two years ago.
At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I’ve had problems with it dropping the internet.
This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired.
The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset.
This was happening once or twice a day.
Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level.
Same problem.
The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem.
Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions.
I had to do a factory reset to restore this.
I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences.
I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router.
It’s fantastic.
I’v Had it for over a week with no problems.
It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris.
I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast.
If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router.
Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.
but it happens enough to be annoying.
On a positive note
1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box.
The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on.
Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point.
The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times...
They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying.
On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop.
Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Ok case with serious limitations
This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max.
The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen.
Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues.
The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand.
The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments.
I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation.
This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy.
Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen.
The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen.
This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees.
This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand.
This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.
Everything I needed
This product is really slick - one stop shopping for all my connectivity needs.
I love just throwing this and my laptops tiny power adapter in my go bag and being prepared to work on a big 4k display or grab photos from my camera.
The only odd thing I experienced (and I’ve experienced this on all 4 usb-c hubs I’ve tried from different brands) is that mac’s apparently can’t tell the difference between multiples of the same monitor (so my mac outputs the same video to all identical monitors connected to the hub whether by HDMI and/or VGA).
But if I use 2 separate hubs/adapters or 2 different models of monitor then the mac properly outputs to the displays individually.
Ok, needs some improvement.
A decent training tool but it really needs to have some sort of Safety Lock over the shock button( been pressed more on accident when it's in my pocket then I've actually intended to use it) my dogs even accidentally zapped herself after stepping on the remote.
Also if your dog likes to roll around in raccoon poop like mine does it is such a pain in the butt to clean.
As the fecal matter gets in between the cracks of the device requiring you to disassemble the entire thing to clean it properly and get the smell out.
Also the range is a bit inconsistent.
I've noticed you almost need line of sight for it to work.
And there have been times where it has not functioned at all even though I'm only 30 feet away from my dog.
Being rechargeable is certainly a nice feature and the charge does last for a good while.
I only need to charge mine about once every two weeks.
You get what you pay for.
Horrible product, misrepresented
I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it.
First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual.
Second, it doesn't come with a charger.
Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer.
Fine, we have lots of those around.
When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out.
I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges.
Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed.
Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning.
I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later.
Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...
Great backpack but overkill on the straps
This backpack looks good and performs well.
It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days.
The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps.
There’s more straps on this bag than I can count.
I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag.
Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college.
There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided.
The flag also is a great finish to it
My dog hasnt destroyed it yet
Have had probs with Hockey Balls.
My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float.
That is until she chews them to bits.
Tried several, even the "hot weather" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others.
Until these showed up.
These have stood the test.
My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews.
Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog.
Thumbs up from Daisy and I.
This product is hazardous to children.
This is a huge health hazard to your baby.
We checked the battery after a couple weeks of use and saw that water went into the compartment where the batteries go.
The batteries themselves had rotted and a black liquid was coming out of them.
Looking at the design, it appears that theres no way the battery enclosure could be waterproof meaning not only did water go into the compartment during bathtime, some of that toxic material came out as well.
Please do not buy this product.
I’m shocked that it was allowed to go to market despite such an obvious flaw.
overheating issues and hard time connecting controller
Im giving it 3 stars for now, i don't want leave a bad review for the seller unless he deserves it but this drone overheats a lot.
Im not sure if i should contact the seller or dji tello themselves but ill probably try both just to see what they say.
I like the drone is a cool little toy that fly's better than some bigger older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one.
However its the only drone i have ever had overheating issues with and it actually takes the fun out of flying im going to assume for now that its a manufacturing issue which they need to address asap if they want there product to be successful.
I really hope the seller did not send me a use drone as i paid for a new one.
I will give the sellers props for delivery as it arrive 1 day after purchase.
I will update date my review after contacting seller and dji tello.
I only have good things to say about this gift bag
I only have good things to say about this gift bag set.
I was able to wrap all of my Christmas gifts with the bags, gift wrap and tissue paper.
The product is great quality and the different size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for every gift!
I highly recommend it.
The seller is absolutely sweet and attentive.
He reached out to me after my purchase to make sure I was happy with my product.
5 stars all the way around!
The physics are terrible and the people that created the game won't do anything about it
Don't buy this game the physics are terrible and I am so mad at this game because probably there are about 40 hackers on every single game and the game.
Don't doesn't even do anything about it you know they just let the hackers do whatever they want and then they do know that the game is terrible but they're doing absolutely nothing about it and the game keeps on doing updates about their characters really what they should be updating is the physics because it's terrible don't buy this game the physics are terrible and mechanics are terrible the people that obviously the people that built this game was high or something because it's one of the worst games I've honestly ever played in my life I would rather play Pixel Games in this crap it's one of the worst games don't buy
Not like other tomb raider games
From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games.
Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren’t smart in knowing what direction you’re trying to take.
Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways.
Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense.
I have not enjoyed this game.
I do not plan on finishing it.
The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.
Ergonomic and affordable, but not very tolerant of constant use
It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller.
The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker.
2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly.
We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year.
So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase.
The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls.
You get what you pay for
I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic.
It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap.
For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me.
I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it.
I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that.
However, it you can overlook that, then it might be right for you.
It was packaged well and did arrive quickly.
Nothing like the previous Stylo phones, MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.
I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus.
Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it.
Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and "in the loop" and I did.
Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves.
When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that.
This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful.
I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account.
I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone.
I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit.
I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone.
Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST.
On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.
My favorite Obama quote: “Michael and I also want to… uh… acknowledge… uh… uh… uh… your son Jack, who deployed today.”
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.
I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best games ever that I have played!
But I have some problems…
I’d always heard of Mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple of months ago, and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists right now.
Anyway, those were just my thoughts.
Happy New Year’s everyone!
I hope the new year treats you well.
Now for this one, it’s kind of hard, because the enemies are so cool for this game, but... If I had to choose, I’d say I like the clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not the only enemy in the game that doesn’t have a single other variation from what I remember.
Honestly, I wasn’t going to make one, but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I disagree with a lot of others’ lists.
Not to say that my list is right, because this is all subjective anyway, which is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
Yay!
In my opinion, Lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind I’ve only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of episode 3).
Unlike her father, Lily tries to work with Lee and for the most part the group.
She does what she has to.
She is a bit of a bitch, because she has to.
I only have 1 problem with Lily.
She killed Carly.
If you could get Ben to confess…
Yes, I got spoiled on that and a few other things.
Ben is useless.
He is what looks like a college student, yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7.
Please don’t downvote me into oblivion if I missed something.
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats.
So 4 isn’t really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kind of sucks in my opinion.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who has lived both as a woman and as a man.
(Not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
So that’s kind of neat in my opinion.
I don’t think he did the role justice.
I feel before Neo figured it out, the way he was speaking was ok, but after… in my opinion, he should have gone full Hugo Weaving speech.
I just wanted to share my opinion not being a United fan, on the game against Burnley.
(Not that many of you will care).
McTominay - sheesh, what a guy.
I thought that Shaw was solid.
Now you’ve got two good left backs in good form.
Also I wanted to say AWB had a much better game, I thought.
After the shitty games and Dalot playing well I personally thought AWB improved a lot.
Haha.
Oh my god, it’s terribly funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can only drop at 4-6,
Yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues, but for me I can live with those issues but not this.
Please change!
It’s kind of an odd question in my opinion, but I have a ball python who I just got to eat frozen/thawed for the first time (yay!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I’ve tried frozen/thawed large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
It could be a fluke though.
I know it’s like a meme or something of “Dark Souls player complains about the combat” or something similar, but I just don’t get the combat.
I can do DS3 Deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately.
I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.
Oh my God!
Why do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they don’t have any idea of how a torrent even works (it’s so damn easy though!).
Comments like “The link doesn’t work”, rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
You’re just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤 Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So I get tipped on the app, they gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the application after?
What the fuck is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before, but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was less than the app tip...
If you are tipping both, tip both.
Not going to lie, Teamfight Tactics is a good mode, but it’s like Hearthstone a good game to play on your phone, not something to grind out all day all night, like what the fuck?
It’s not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on, prep up and alt tab until it’s next time you can do anything).
Any thoughts?
I know it’s a scientific things and all, but some of the posts there are just too much.
Learning dream languages?
What the fuck?
And some bloke is saying “I tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didn’t lucid dream?!” every few hours.
Maybe the posts are just getting a little too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like “Dear lord, what the fuck is happening, ooh”.
So I am a first time cup user, and I got the Saalt cup at Target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today, and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold + 17 year-old virgin = ow).
I got it in with the 7-fold, and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how the fuck am I supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails?
In one way, it kind of helped me find the cup lowkey grip, but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping.
I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes.
Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop).
Then I walked back and forgot my groceries.
I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill.
I live on a hill. Down. In the middle, really.
I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco.
So I walked back and got them.
No crime round these parts.
Not much, anyway.
I didn’t think about nails...
Is he going to tell her?
If so how would that conversation go down?!
Okay, what the fuck! Arlo now knows Sera (I don’t know how to spell her full name) is John’s weakness.
First of all, we’ve seen they are greedy as fuck (OK, not as much other mobile studios, but still).
Second, the game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high-end phones).
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
What the fuck are you Yanks on?

I’m never moving to canada.
Sometimes it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me the fuck out and gives me nods similar to codeine.
Why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with whether or not a woman looks at me and thinks I’m ugly.
If that happens, I get anxious from it.
But if a women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks I’m decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
What the fuck is going on?
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisible, even if they don’t detect you, they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I should’ve just grabbed a submachine gun and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many tries, most of them being on his second phase.
His 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7th place on the last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead of 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Because I have less than 3000 points.
(I need 55 Magaki frags and I get 50 - just feel my suffering)
Also in another event with gamer764 I have around 8000 points and got 4th place and got rewards for 4th place, not for 1st.
What is it with needing 7k points or more?
Are the developers too greedy?
I hope the title makes sense.
I have a list of names “john.baker” (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 columns “john” and “baker”.
Thanks!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were going to see each other, and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday, and so I canceled it, and now she won’t stop saying sorry that’s not what she meant.
What the fuck do I do?
I told her I was going on another one next month (lie) to make her feel better, but I didn’t.
But I don’t necessarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks!
Okay, so I’ve got less than a chapter left in Gardens of the Moon and I still can’t understand what the fuck Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I’m missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots.
You all are whack.
What the fuck! I posted a literal anime foot and still didn’t even make most controversial post of the day, let alone of all time.
So huh, you can’t alpha Karthus ult?
What the fuck is this bullshit?
It would be very helpful if all of you original posters out there actually said what the fuck it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it!
Such as “now I understand why this [brand name] thing has everyone going crazy”…
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn’t mean much to me.
If it’s too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever at the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the “DFW teams are cursed” camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me too much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential what the fuck transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a PC, but in the meantime I’m using a crappy 13-year-old PC.
I got money for Rust, bought it and it took 4 hours to download, 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server.
After I hit a tree with my rock, my game crashed.
At this time it was 12:47 am and I just said fuck it and went to bed ready for a whole lot of shit today.
EM opens the door: May I help you?
Me: Yes! Why did you give your kid permission to enter my house without my permission?
EM: GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.
GT pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
My girlfriend’s face just turned red, because the treasure he found was her dildo.
My girlfriend snatches that out of GT’s hand.
GF: This isn’t meant for kids.
GT: But it’s mine - I found it and finders keepers.
EM: Give him back his treasure.
Me: Why the fuck are you not watching your son, EM, because he has embarrassed my girlfriend and entered my home without permission.
I have to break up the format “xxx.yyy” into two separate columns “xxx” and “yyy”.
Stop!
Me: Yes, ma’am.
EM: What are you listening to?
Me: Better Off Dead from Josh A.
EM: What?!
EK: mom, stop!
Me: Bett-
EM: I heard you. What is that cover? *points to album cover*
Me: Oh, I think that’s a reference to cu-
EM: *cuts me off again* to satanic ritual.
Me: No, not at all.
EK: Mom, please stop!
EM: No, EK, this is a bad man.
EM (to me): Now give me your phone.
It was at this moment I knew this was a entitled parent.
Me: No.
EM: But my EK needs it. He’s got his degree.
EK: Mom, I’m 10.
Me: *coughs* Damn!
EM: How dare you swear in front of my son?
Yes, she said that damn was a cuss.
Me: Damn is not a cuss word.
She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot and cold.
Now she’s on to another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state.
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago, we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind of disrespectful to the new boyfriend, huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd.
However, I will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her, but I can’t think of a reason why I should…
After going “uh no?”, she sends me a picture of said candle holder from her kitchen.
I of course go “what the fuck, you’re home?”, and it turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So I’m beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
TLDR: sickly narcisstic mom went into hospital for 3 days.
I find out she’s home because of a candle holder.
It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is that I let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message I sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful because of a song I made that I was sharing.
I was very flirtatious, maybe more so than I was with my girlfriend when I was first talking to her, and that has been echoing in my girlfriend’s mind.
It’s been extremely difficult for her.
We have two dogs now.
I was hoping us having two puppies to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again, because we have them to bond over, but she still can’t say “I love you too”.
She doesn’t accept when I try to give her compliments, because I’ve said rude things in the past when I used to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games, but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you, but I don’t see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trimming my nails, wearing Versace Crystal Noir and other fragrances etc., which I believe is the reason why most girls, even if they’re taken, at least are willing to have a conversation with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self-development, and even though I’ve been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, I never let it get me down and I’m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women, even though I may not have Hollywood good looks or charisma like Will Smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and I wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :-)
She’s 18 inches long and weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
I’m just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champion every 4-5 days and she’s already longer than some males get, so I’m curious!
The anime is about a main character that’s in a game, but she doesn’t realise it, but the system says she’s dead and etc.
I would like to watch the rest of it, so please help me.
Looking for an anime.
I don’t know if to others it’s strange, but to me it was.
I got Covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so I had to tell my mum.
I could’ve just lied and said it was because of sharing cups or kissing a girl, since I’m bi-sexual, but I knew my parents would be accepting...
So I told them as it was.
My mum was very disappointed, because she thought she knew me well, and though I told her everything, but now she couldn’t trust me anymore, because blah blah blah…
Basically, he was very disappointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that I didn’t feel like telling her, because it’s private to me... until today.
She doesn’t really trust me like before, but she’s ok, lol.
Today it’s my birthday, so I’m sharing my “strange” coming out story.
I am confused.
What’s going on, lol?
This is my first time with SFU e-mail.
After the semester I haven’t touched anything school-related until today heh, so I don’t know how to fix this.
So me and my friend started playing Valorant again and want us to learn communications such as heaven and all of that.
Now I know what heaven is, but I don’t know others, and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If you’re still confused, I’ll give a scenario: “I hit the Jett, she’s in heaven”, like the location.
She’s an awesome cook, does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but she’s not a good cook either, lol.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well.
She can’t be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or it’s a guy)
She’s all nice and sweet to everyone else, but she’s just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong (not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it., which is wrong.
When she is there, she doesn’t do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren’t there.
The worst part about it is that people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The “false advertising” on the A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill, where it says multiple buffs can’t co-exist.
Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this is all dumb and also kills a lot of people’s excitement.
I don’t like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star, lol.
It’s just like Zhongli.
He was fine, but everyone freaked, because he wasn’t doing enough to dumpster content and was balanced.
I’ve seen lots of people in the fandom make rude or racist comments about Liberty and it’s disgusting.
Please leave her alone.
And you do realize she’s black?
Stop making fun of the actors’ ethnic features.
It’s honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general.
It’s not even funny.
Honestly, it’s just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And it’s not even just Liberty. I’ve seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmy’s hair.
(Also moderators, please don’t take this down.
I really want people to see it, and I have done nothing wrong.
I’ve been having some of my posts randomly deleted for no reason)
(As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guacamole.)
She then told me we gave her less meat, when I brought back the same plate without guacamole.
She’s home for the first time!
She’s finally back!
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my puppy in her crate at night, because if I don’t she will poop on the floor.
So there’s already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then I have work, which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my Corgi in my bathroom at this time, because if I don’t, she will reek havoc unsupervised.
Am I the asshole for starting a fight with an old friend (strong swearing)?
Even better for me it would be:
It would be an unbelievable loss to let a broken and thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest apologies for bumping straight into a noble that half-marched in his drunken stupor down the sidewalk, straight out of a liquor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the main street makes in a month, I was invited to finish the wasted goods, lest they spoil any further.
“Yes sir! May the heavens cry before your merciful heart!”
“Now get lost! This is no place for disease-ridden vermin like you.”
“Of course my lord!”
I ran back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and further out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on Snapchat with my friend.
Me and my friend were arguing as a “joke” and then she said she preferred older guys, and my friend was (M14), and I said I’m a year older than you, and she says “what I mean by older guys, I mean aged 17” and it hurt my heart.
TLDR: My crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and I’m 16 and she’s 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here, but I don’t know if I am the butthole or entitled one this story.
This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.
I sent a direct message to the artist I wanted, but nothing for 2 months.
Like yeah, I understand they are booked for summer tattoos, but at least say “Hey I am booked for the rest of ____”.
But I was like “ok, well I am going to look at another artist’s work from this shop that does small tattoos.”
Same thing happens: no answer.
So me and my brother decide “ok, let’s go to the shop and ask, then we will at least get a answer”.
We go, and this young girl attends to us. Let’s call her Brenda.
I told her everything.
Brenda said “well you can do the tattoo with me”.
I said “I’ll be back. I’ll think about it”.
I got back in the car and scrolled through her work.
It was good work, so I went back and told her “yeah let’s do this”.
I signed everything.
She didn’t even ask for ID, which I found weird, because I had gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on.
I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.
She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.
I was like “ok, great, thanks!”
4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.
The right side of the heart was smaller then the other side, and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again.
So I reset it, and yeah oops, I was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn’t dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry, and like through text she kind of sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if she’s mad, and like she said she’s only a bit let down.
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me, and like I apologized to her and she said its alright.
Then I just told her I’m going to sleep, and she just left my message on delivered and, like, she didn’t reply until today.
How to tell whether she’s mad at me or just annoyed, because right now I’m really confused?
Would I be the asshole if I was just a bigger sarcastic asshole to another asshole?
Her tumors are beginning to open through her skin, she won’t jump, painkillers don’t help, she ate a lot yesterday but won’t eat or drink today, she hid most the day, but... it’s hard, because she’s alert.
It feels wrong, because she looks at me like “I love you.
I’m happy you’re here with me.”
But the vet said she wasn’t even supposed to live this long, and the tumors will only get worse, and even if we had done chemotherapy, it would have only prolonged it.
My friend told my girlfriend something.
She then broke up with me.
I don’t know what to do now, because she and the ex-friend were the only people that I had.
What should I do to try and regain my relationship, because she’s helped me through a lot over our 2 years of dating?
TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me because of something someone said, and I want to regain my relationship with my girlfriend.
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee, because she’s a person of color with tattoos and “fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up, because I need to protect my staff, but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex loves kids.
She was playing Captain Save a Hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman’s situation with this girl’s “crazy” baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in each other’s life.
It hasn’t even been two months!
I’m so hurt.
She never wanted to build a life with me.
I knew she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, as soon as he saw that I was weeping, answered,  “Come with me.”
Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.
Entering, he led me with him on the bounds of a great circle itself encircling a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land covered with lava pyramids, with sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life save for those imprisoned in it, who, though they surrounded us, dared not approach for fear of the master.
As my ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, cries, and explosions that made the eternal air tremble, caused by slaughter, starvation, withering, and frief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, of men, women, and children.
They’ve grown out to the point they look kind of awkward, and she’s saying I should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something I’d like better?
Aah!
She said she might have some clothes that fit me.
I’m dying!
She’s so supportive and nice, oh my God!
So, it’s 0:34 the first of January while posting this, and my sister (F14) just ruined my New Year by calling my mum fat and telling her she’s a drinker when she poured herself a glass of champagne, which she only does on her birthday on Christmas Eve and on New year.
Now my parents are pissed off, my grandparents are pissed off, and my sister thinks she was funny.
The same thing happened on Christmas Eve, and now the whole feeling of New Year is gone and I hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sorry for my spelling.
Screw INTJ’s.
Why have they got to be good at everything?
It was a mistake getting the booster the day before New Year’s.
I feel like absolute dog water.
Literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and I almost cried 🙏
I’m so happy, bro.
She’s so cool.
I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :-)
Also, happy New Year’s Eve and happy New Year everyone!
First of all, the satisfaction I get from saying I am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
A high I’ll never come off of.
Second of all, a customer comes in for the second time, mad because I didn’t do copies from a book because of copyright.
She goes “well, I called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
And I’m like ??, ma’am it’s in our policy.
I don’t care what customer service says.
She keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy”.
Like, lol, not when you act rude like that.
Our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and she’s such a cuddly, loving, little girl and I love her cuddles every night and in the morning.
I’m just scared that she isn’t going to be like that after she gets fixed.
Am I overthinking it?
Do you think since she’s in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she’ll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I don’t fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently she’s been asking me if I’ll fart in front of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and it’s weird she’s never heard me do it.
I can’t believe she saying I’m depressed looking while she’s such a shy girl and weird thinking she’s not.
So delusional.
I hate it, but they are my only friends.
She’s calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to D2 after several year, now I’m wondering:
Where do you guys sell or buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or is there a website that’s more efficient?
My friends are mean and delusional.
One is immature and shy and always pulling me down.
The other is fine, just jealous, and it’s getting on my nerves.
What to do?
This is a setup I can live with.
My boyfriend’s and my fear however is that in a few years when we’re ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own boyfriend.
I’m very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow any more pushing of the boundaries.
What do I do here?
Boundary Issues with my boyfriend’s alter.
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was up-front when we met and said she’s shit at texting, and has apologised when we were speaking for slow replies, something to which I said “don’t worry, I know you’re busy!”
The conversation seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation.
However, I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread), but she’s viewed my story and posted a story since.
It was New Year’s Eve.
So I was all ready for the New Year actually thinking positive and the changes I’m going to make, etc.
Then I see he’s posted a picture of them both that she’s taken saying “love of my life”.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face!
Ex’s boyfriend posted a picture of them :-(
Every time I ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even though she’s older, what the fuck?) and that I shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her.
She drains the life out of me.
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently I’ve been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, I could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brought herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to separate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later, we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great.
I’m so happy.
In our anniversary month, what do I see on his phone Snapchat?
I look at it again, I see Jane, but this time I can look at their conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So I just got my first bearded dragon.
He’s only a month old, and like most new owners, I’m worried about if he or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day, but so far I’ve only been able to feed him about 6-7 crickets.
I’ve tried feeding him some vegetables too, but the guy doesn’t show any interest in them.
Is there anything I’m doing wrong or is he just fine and I’m overly worried?
Then I found out about this really cool website called Complex.
They’re sort of like journalism but better, since they’re all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through Complex.
Before, I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic, but Travis Scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
Now I like Tame Impala, and I’ve started dressing weirder, I bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully I’ll wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromises himself/herself on social media?
Is it just me cringing at the Twitter posts by Albatross?
Everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
He’s making it seem like XVG is a sinking ship at the moment, and it’s doing fine.
So I have this friend in real life.
Man, the dude is known everywhere.
He’s got a solid reputation on the streets, in the jails. Everywhere this guy goes, everyone knows him.
He was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on Reddit, because I feel like I’m not really known.
How do you get hella karma?
I’m 21, he’s about to be 23.
My issue is that he seems to have no ambition anymore.
He doesn’t work and doesn’t make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an EMT.
He failed it the first time by 2 points, and I think he fears failure so he doesn’t really want to try anything anymore.
He’s been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
I’ve gotten Super Smough about 5 times, but I always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear I’m far enough away, but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
I’m using a 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helms and naked (even with tattered armor it doesn’t seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know by throwing myself at them enough times I’ll get them, but it’s slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do, but I seem to always get caught in a dumb combination or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or notice the letter I put in there, and now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you you read this sentence wrong too?
Well, now that I have your attention!
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :-)
19/F Aw shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time.
If I just want to make Draven my 1 carry, how should I do it?
I know he’s a good unit, but what items can turn him into a god?
I tried healing sword and rapid fire cannon, but I get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character.
However, his shield’s gun is overpowered and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets that’s fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate, because it got absorbed.
I don’t know about other players’ opinions, but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so he’s not overpowered enough to counter everything.
Tell me what you people think.
I didn’t think anything of it, so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him, the entitled kid started screaming “Mommy, he stole my cookies!”
At first I was startled.
I started to get nervous, and I froze.
Then entitled parent walks up and starts yelling “Give those cookies back to my daughter! Give them back!”
And I did not know what to say at first, but then something came to mind: just say “but I didn’t.”
But the way I said it was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That’s when my dad noticed (he’s old — sad he didn’t realise a little bit earlier)
He called a manager to the scene, and the manager told us to continue and he’ll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We’re both xxx majors (I’m a dual xxx and yyy major while she’s a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn’t say I’m smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I’m a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (she will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
It’s not until my next billing cycle that I noticed something was off.
I was a bit lower than normal and I keep a very close eye on my expenses.
I looked over my bank statements and there it was:
My new Prime bill.
I was super confused and got hold of Amazon’s customer support.
They helped me as much as they could, but because I was receiving my service through the phone company, I would have to go though them and figure out the problem.
The next day that I had off, I walked in and talked to a very sweet girl, who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kind of talked in circles for a bit as I tried to explain what the Amazon customer service told me.
We looked me up in their system and there I was: 2 lines, but no Prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date I opened my first line and then the second.
Both dates added up to what I had told her before.
She stared at the computer screen for a while with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tomorrow I’m no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach out all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered, it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance, and he messaged me on Friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said I didn’t change anything.
After that part of the conversation ended, I asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
He said that he’s good when he doesn’t think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him, etc.
Day 1 of no contact starts tomorrow.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster.
We used my name and I’ll credit his Instagram below.
He’s a good guy.
I’m glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and our story.
Would you guys like either homemade lore or not?
I couldn’t post this on the Fallout Reddit for some reason.
It wouldn’t let me put the photo.
I hope it’s good, guys!
Is it even possible for ITSOKTOCRY to blow up outside of the 3 songs he’s had do extremely well?
Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for a while, and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much I despise griefers, because they don’t just destroy something in a game, they destroy hours of work, and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying I’m mean if I don’t go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non-stop how I’m “mean” or a “bad person”, because I’m busy doing something so I can’t go give him his shit.
Well, I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I don’t see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy.
We do get slightly tipsy, you know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a Facebook message saying he’s ready for her to leave (she’d been there 2 hours at this point) and then he starts passive-aggressive cleaning in front of us.
He’s going through a divorce so he keeps telling me that’s taking all his money.
I didn’t give him a title as I didn’t even get one when I bought it.
It was salvaged from some guys at a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale, but I’ve long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do you think it’s not worth it?
Also, if I did want to how, would I?
So I just told this guy in my class, who was also weird as fuck and gave it to him saying “oof, I sat on it. It broke. Do you just want it?”
He’s like “no, ew”.
I have OCD and immediately got ashamed and was like “lol, why’s it gross?
It’s the same as a whole one (and along that line), like, lol, why?”, and he was like “ok, oof, it’s not” and I’m like “lol, why did you say that?”
I was saying it jokingly, but I’m afraid I looked weird.
Like what the fuck?
Why’s she upset or playfully upset that I don’t want it.
My human staff comes home tasting of sausages and cheese.
I think she has another fluff she is making treats for.
Should I be sad or angry?
What does your human taste of when they come home?
I can tell where your human has been and what they do by taste when they come back?
Anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday I finally mustered up the courage to message him.
Me: Hey, how’s everything?
Him: It’s been a long time.
Me: Sorry about last year.
I was super awkward around you, lol.
Him: lol, no, don’t worry about it.
*drum roll please*
Me: To be honest, I liked you blah blah blah…
Him: Haha, you could’ve just told me!
Next time you see me just say hi.
Do you still go to <school>?
I’m not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn’t sit well with me.
Hey guys, I just wanted to share this helpful application with you all :-D.
It’s not that I am trying to promote this application or something.
It really helped me a lot.
That’s why I thought it might even help you guys out.
I’ve seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team OVRs, and many are thinking to buy players, but can’t decide which will boost their team OVRs the most.
This application helps to calculate the OVR of your team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people (F2P players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team OVR since it will result in a huge loss of coins (because of 10% EA tax).
What’s the recommended amount of dedicated RAM I should have to server?
If you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.
You should be asleep.
Go to bed, I say.
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Star Butterfly.
She had blond hair, blue eyes and a super cute and colorful dress.
And she had a magic wand!
One day she got kicked out of Mewny (her home dimension) by her mean mom >:-( just because she made a mistake.
So she had to go to Earth.
On Earth, there was a boy named Marco Diaz.
He liked safety and he was super handsome.
Everybody at school was in love with him!
(Except for that idiot Jackie)
So anyway, Star came to the principal’s office.
He was like “Star, this is Marco. He’s your guide.”
Star looked at Marco and she was shocked.
“Wow, you’re so hot.”
“lol, thank you” he said, blushing, and he winked.
“Let me show you around the school.”
“Ok”, said Star.
So they walked around school and they became friends.
“Ok, since you’re my best friend now, I should probably tell you who I am”, said Star.
“I’m a magic princess”.
Then she took out her wand and created 667 laser puppies!
I have a question for this Reddit.
Can you provide honest answers?
I currently have a custom build PC with i7 3770k 32g@1666 RAM and single GTX 1080 GPU.
Should I get a second one for 650 euros or wait for what upcoming years will bring?
GTX 1080 SLI or save money for 11th generation Nvidia xx80 TI GPU?
I know a lot about Jailbreak.
Should I make a Jailbreak?
How many likes can a thoughtless post get as long as I like Telecaster? :l.
If you don’t upvote post you hate Telecasters and should die.
Thanks, ok.
I love Telecasters.
We should rename August to October, because he wasn’t released in August.
I’m out, boys :-)
I bought GTA4 for Steam PC and it won’t work.
It worked fine for a small year on Windows 7, and now my PC has Windows 10 and it won’t work.
I made Social Club and Games for Windows Live accounts, but it won’t work even with accounts.
It won’t work even for single player.
It won’t work after the people on screen wait in the loading screen.
Then suddenly when the game should start, it just closes the window and that’s it.
So how make it work ?
How do we get them to know they should use it?
The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse...
I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty.
I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens.
I want to own freedom...
How do we change the landscape?
What are your thoughts?
Sorry for my English being bad.
I should buy up that limited time bike for Halloween before it disappears next week.
Inside your body, deep beneath your skin, muscles, and not beneath your organs, lurks 1 (one) skeleton.
Spooky!
But wait, it gets worse.
The skeleton inside you doesn’t even pay rent!
He/she lives in your body so he/she should pay rent!
They freeload off you and don’t even do shit for you.
So you should evict your spooky boy.
Happy Halloween!
Edit: I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it has!
Thanks for the 6 upvotes!
Just small information, I’m 5’9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k, but I really can’t hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical “you should be good, but you’re not, so I’m going to give you unrealistic goals”, or should I be at 1:49?
My head hurts when I go krumping heads with other boys!
Green lighting things go all over the place too!
What should I do, doctors?!
Right, so I’ve fixed my headaches!
I’ve had to throw up some burny green stuff!
The boss says I should do that more on the battle, the place we’ve been fighting in!
I’ve got a metal stick for my trouble too!
This poem went as follows:
> My name is frog,
> I like to play,
> Out in the rain,
> All night and day.
> My skin is green,
> My face is coy,
> You look and say,
> Here comes that boy.
This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Aren’t you all tired of seeing at least the first two jumping into battle and wiping out your whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying that if they weren’t here then, well, the game would be balanced.
Well, I beg to differ, because there’s Akai with his insane disruption and Diggie with his timely ult or maybe even Irithel might be banned because of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly, the king and queen of this game are Lancelot and his beloved Fanny.
You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is.
She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo. You be a good girl!”
She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak.
Haha!
Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what?
Haha!
She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl!
You left the steak alone!”
And that is the story of me being a good girl.
Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt.
She says she is dumb not to think of that.
Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers.
Now I obviously can’t get out and shut it on the main road, so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I’ve quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothing’s happened.
My bed smells like disease.
I should probably wash it.
Please send me some tips and stuff on what to teach him.
Currently he’s doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns, because that’s the only gun he gets kills from.
I already taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
By the way, this is coming from an Iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say I should be silver and some even say platinum, because I carried a gold player).
Do you know how some motherfuckers exist?
They literally get close to you, then all of a sudden you have problems, and even though you apologize again and again and again, no it’s never enough for them.
I was in a Google Meet, but I told them I’d be back in 10.
I forgot my phone so I went to get it, and guess what, them speaking about you and backstabbing you.
You seriously don’t know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
Maybe I am overthinking, but I’d rather die alone than live among these kind of people.
Maybe I should just ignore them?
Or should I give them another chance?
Or maybe I am just weird, lol.
l have developed feelings for my best friend.
Now, the question is: should l tell her how l feel about her?
Will this affect our relationship that we have?
How will she take it?
I’ve been waiting for two years now, savings from then and I barely made 200 USD until now.
I’m still studying, and gaming is my dream… and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness from life… to be honest…
What should I get?
A monitor or a GPU…?
Some of you are so lucky to get a GPU for free on here… lol…
Am I the asshole? Me (31F) asked my kids dad (43M) to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in the kids’ room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not meant to lift too much or stretch but felt OK and thought I could do it alone.
I can’t.
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of the walls where I can’t reach.
He said yes and today came to do it.
After a bit, he said he was done and leaving.
I gave him £20 and said how grateful I am for the help.
I checked the room once he left...
Both kids’ beds were full of torn off wallpaper, drawers cracked where he stood on them.
I’ve still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent the last 45 minutes picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds.
Am I the asshole if I confront him about the mess or should I let it go and not bother asking in future?
My boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when I ask dumb questions (for example, I didn’t know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard? Just fill it”.
So I tried to do it but I failed.
Later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?”
Then when I do it myself and don’t ask him he goes “why don’t you ask me? I can teach you or help you”, but I refrain from asking, because he gets frustrated.
The last couple of calls had arguments, as he got mad, because I beat his ass in video games (even though gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked about him to lots of my real life friends, and they all ask why I continue to be his friend, and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only people who actively tries to interact with him online.
Yeah I know, my shoes don’t match.
They match the graffiti though!
I’m trying a lot of different styles, so let me know what I should change.
Hat: Sicko by Ian Conner
Shoes: Nike
Everything else is thrifted.
Ok, so I swallowed a small piece of box (?) tape as I was trying to bite it off with my teeth, and then I feel it in my ear 😭 not ear but that hole in my throat that leads to the ear. It’s just stuck there, oh my God 😭😭😭
What should I do, lol?
I don’t remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida, there’s a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100 times longer than when it’s not making a sound.
I’d describe it as that trademark desert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff, and … it’s just dude what…? Heck, it’s weird.
So maybe it’s both a sort of a paradox (life is), but I just want to know, honestly, did anyone else feel it?
I want a logical explanation please, and if one doesn’t exist, well I mean, because long before… I was “of age” so to speak… for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate, because I don’t drink, but I’ve…hmm… I’m an adult, let’s put it like that.
There’s other stuff out there, but long before that, me and my family saw a UFO.
Even my stepdad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been, and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall and, like… it doesn’t really scare me, because I think it’s the way life is.
Things change.
They don’t always have to make sense, and others say that too.
Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling:
> The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.
And so the North Wind was obliged to confer that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm autumn moon.
Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you yet again, creating chaos.
Who would win?
Please give a detailed explanation.
Ares (Greek mythology) vs. Mars (Roman mythology) vs. Svetovid (Slavic mythology) vs. Odin (Norse mythology) vs. The Big Bang (Atheistic mythology).
I am very ready.
I am very good.
I would like to apply for village idiot.
Should I get Horizon Zero Dawn or ELEX, because they are the same price right now, so what should I buy?
I’m just looking for reason.
By the way, I like open world a lot and shooters, e.g. Skyrim, Battlefield, COD, Ark Survival Evolved.
So any ideas on what I should be?
By the way, I would prefer them really quick.
Thanks in advance.
Thanks for the suggestions guys.
We are going to try to get the AK-477, because someone said it would help, but where do we find it?!
Please help with it.
We can’t do it alone :-)
I reside in Hyderabad, India, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in computer science.
I am a Canadian citizen, but for enrolment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam.
Now, the doubt that has arisen is… would my admission be considered international or domestic?
On a side note, how hard is it to be admitted to UoT’s computer science program?
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
I would prefer a hardcore clan with a plan. With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal or target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It’s not a necessity, but it would be nice.
PM me if you’re interested!
By the way, it’s my first post on this subreddit, so I might not have gotten it all down correct.
Locusts, grasshoppers, etc. can shut the hell up.
I’ve literally heard people tell me they learnt then forgot the entire Japanese language through anime.
I live in a house with a single mother whose first language is Thai and I barely heard English until I was like 4.
She would speak in Thai to me yet I don’t know any Thai.
You can’t learn Japanese though anime.
In fact I watched anime in Thai dubbed as a child.
I don’t fucking know shit.
Fools thinking they are out here saying “konnichiwa” in style, I’m contacting the authorities.
Here’s a question for you.
So you know the Panzer, Blue Gitz, the Tau or whatever?
So I, being a Mek, notice that they’ve got tanks and stuff that are flying, right, but they’ve not go the flames coming from whatever thrusters keep them in the air.
And they don’t make the beautiful roar that thrusters make.
I figure some commando would want a flying truck that doesn’t make a noise.
It’s a good market strategy.
Anyway, the question: “how do I krump gravity without a sound?”
Construction: teleport to house, for when they work on making player-owned houses useful, this would be godly to have.
Heck! Even now, player-owned houses has a permanent dummy for adrenaline building, prayer altar, and if they make it like Old School RuneScape, where you can teleport outside any player-owned house portal, this cape would be used a lot.
Hitpoints: Heal from regeneration ability increased, current perk I doubt would be used at either bossing or slayer.
This one is used at slayer at least.
I got one of my annual minds.com token ads in my mail today (I of course unsubscribed as soon as I found the option) and thought “hey, what the heck, let’s make a visit on the supposedly “alternative Facebook” that I just recently got denied for having a “non-believable name” and waiting further ID specification before I can use it again.”
And so I did and found out on the 2nd or 3rd post that The AJ Show has been blocked on YouTube,
I’m not a fan of rightwing stuff and was actually the reason I stopped watching it 2 years ago, though the small fragrance of freedom was that hard to find among the 90% national-capitalism the site has to offer, but anyhow, I got the idea of a non-censoring video site like LiveLeak but much more simple and less “newsy” that anyone can post on. No content would be removed ❤️
Hi guys.
I’m at 1500 hours right now, and my instructor still doesn’t let me solo.
I think I’m doing my manoeuvres ok, but the instructor says I still need more practice. I’ve tried my manoeuvres on a flight simulator, and my friend captain says that I should stop sending him videos of me playing GTA on my computer at 1 in the morning, although I trained hard on my flight manoeuvres.
What should I do?
I’m literally crying and shaking right now.
My friend would never do that :-(
Why don’t they make like Sesame Street for the kids, yo?
Like, it is very educational, I think kids would learn a lot from it.
I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras.
I have some questions and hope someone can help answer.
1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc.
Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about?
2. Is there enough parking for the second car?
3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to?
4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ?
It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place...
I appreciate any advice I get.
Bones says something like “switchblade on my waist don’t test”, and it was old young teenage bones, and the beat was hella mellow.
I would really appreciate this.
Finally it’s giving me an internet connection, but the only problem is, it’s so slow.
It’s capable of loading like Google, but anything else just times out.
And for some reason I can’t access my router admin page.
Really weird.
It’s just a white screen or it times out loading it, or the page becomes unresponsive!
Help would be appreciated, thank you!
Hey all, so today I was in the group chat with friends, and like four of them were roasting the fuck out of me, and at first it was funny, then my ego and self-respect got crippled after building it up for a couple days.
Haha, fun.
Yes, I know I am lonely and won’t get a girlfriend, but you don’t need to be jerk like that, haha.
I’ve searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
They could even go woah eee ahh ahh/oh eee ahh.
The possibilities are endless and I know it’s hard.
I’m just wondering if anyone knows it, thanks!
Hi there, it’s good to see you again!
*sits down*
How have you been?
*cuts a potato with my sacrificial dagger*
Wow, that’s great to hear.
*adds 12kg of salt*
Hm, there we go.
*throws a handful over my left shoulder for the devil*
Ok good, let’s eat.
*removes a small flask from my jacket and pours blood from it onto my plate in a small thick puddle*
Haha, that’s the good stuff right there.
*chomp chomp*
Do you want some? No?
Ok good *eats a spoonful of salt*
Oh! This is crunchy.
*chews and spits out bones*
Huh *licks lips*
Welp, that was wonderful, I’m pooped.
*gets up*
Thanks for having me over!
*transforms into a bat and flies away*
I’m feeling sad, but it’s okay I guess. Because medicines will help help us all.
Thank you, have a good morning and good night and good evening Truman show, haha.
Just kidding.
It’s going to be just as shitty if not worse than last year.
All these skin mods and such, how’s it being done?
I’d like to try it.
Is it player-side only?
Mods? How are people modding Battlefront 2 or is it Photoshop?
Hi, I was wondering whether or not it is worth dropping some money on pets.
Like, I saw how much some people can spend on them to get good results (like T4), and I wouldn’t want to spend that much :-D.
Currently, I have 5 T1 pets, and I wouldn’t mind seeing some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping “just” $100 would be worth it.
Is it worth dropping $100 on pets?
Towards the end of senior year and that summer, I don’t know what happened, but I got a hot body and my face was all “girl, you’ve been through some shit. Have a gift”, so now I’m pretty.
I just made a post on a different subreddit about having a nice date today, which is nice, but I am very hesitant on making friends and stuff because of the last two years.
So like, after my glow up or whatever, more people started talking to me, yeah.
And a lot of boys did too!
I never really had very many friends, so this was a huge yay!
The first boy I hung out with was really nice, but then we got high and I did very regrettable things I do not like.
Well, that boy was super happy and told lots of boys.
I don’t want to jinx it and call them out by name, but I’m talking with a company and I’m hoping it works out!
I’m excited about all things I’ll be able to do with these free promo products to help other people and possibly get them off some or all of their Rx drugs!
I’m excited for myself, because I have a bunch of medical issues that I do not use Rx drugs for and the other stuff I buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others, and it will help this company as well.
I’m ready, I’m ready!
I’m hella excited!
I might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do: my plant’s now way too small for its age in my opinion and has started to grow pistils.
Should I chop and restart or…?
I will be posting more here once I get… comfortable again.
(Self-love is important!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through - will get to them when I can :-)
In the meantime, Happy New Year!
P.S. I don’t have a Snapchat and don’t take any money, I just like to show off, you know, closet slut things :-) lol
Talk to you later, everyone!
He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.
I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No. You’re fucked up now.
What’s going on?”
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says “good lord, what the fuck happened?
I’ve got to garden.
Talk to you later”.
He read my reply, which said “I’m so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it, and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated”.
I just don’t know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him, and he will always be my first, and I’ll always talk to him and care for him, but I don’t want to be held in limbo.
I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know whenever I say “talk to you later” or “good night” or whatever I want to add an “I love you”. Just casually. To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day, just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten-fold.
I know sometimes I daydream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
It makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
To be honest, I kind of hope it is, because I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof, is it hitting me hard!
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I (I will takes days or a week to respond), but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to at the moment.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick “talk to you later” either to be honest.
Finally they seem to want to engage with me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then on the day.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on, and it’s not like we’re really talking, so I just block them.
I don’t know, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival.
I’m still “Ocean Serene”, but maybe I’m... I don’t know, that’s a tough thing to say, I never thought that my girlfriend was just a random.
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said a lot of things, I’m gonna agree that if I change, the world changes.
The advice you get, it’s always iffy.
I want to speak for everyone, but at the same time I can only speak for myself.
Also, I went to get some rum and coke.
I got coke and a few other people saw it, so they bought some coke… erm, I hope my friends are ok (that’s all you weirdos I’m talking about).
Random story I know.
To be honest, I’m not ok, but I’m surviving like usual.
Actually I’m all just a bit right and fine. Talk to you later.
Talk to you later.
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, it’s 8 hours to [redacted], 7 to [redacted].
Not a big deal.
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles, an hour’s drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] I suppose [redacted] or [redacted]’s wife ratted me out.
Maybe I should block them too.
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house, and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you, and we can see how well that went.
[me] Shit. Betrayal.
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self-gratification.
I was in a toxic relationship for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our relationship, we were great.
One day, both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
I’m going to admit that sometimes when I feel jealous, I just want her to reassure me like how I reassure her that it’s all good, but she will only reassure me once and then said “bye” or “talk to you later”.
Most of the time in an argument, it’s always my fault.
She won’t admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight won’t continue anymore.
And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”
And he said “Yeah, well I’ve got to go. I’m doing something”, and I was going to type “alright, talk to you later”, but I realized we aren’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the conversation started.
But once he said he’s doing something, my heart dropped.
Like, what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him, but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doens’t like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now, I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he wants to do that.
If he doesn’t want to talk to me, he can just fucking tell me.
I don’t know what else to put besides that I hate the current circumstance of  life I live in.
I’m going to give a little insight tomorrow.
Ok, I lied.
I have to reveal my age tomorrow, because if I don’t, it’ll mess up the story.
Um, I don’t know what to type so I’ll type a worry I have.
Um, I don’t think I’ll get the tape gun in time.
Ok bye, talk to you later everyone.
She said something like “but I want to make sure that we go as a friend?” thing and I was like “okay, I know”, and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said “of course I like my long time boyfriend”.
Yeah, whatever, right, haha.
And here’s my question...
Yesterday when I was at work, she messaged me saying something like “how’s your work doing?”, and I kind of replied to her with a cold tone saying “I’m at work, talk to you later”, and then she, kind of upset: “Okay, I mean I understand you are at work so busy, but you didn’t cut me off like this before; so I kind of get it that you don’t want to talk anymore like before.
Got it!
Bye!”
How do you get destiny delicacies?
I’ve seen a few people have them, but I’ve never got one.
I don’t know where you get them.
If anyone knows, it would be a lot of help :-)
And my machine fucking freezes up.
It’s been happening for like 2 days now...
This machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3D scanner, but 4 browser tabs on Reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% of my damn memory and 60% of my CPU power and freezes the whole damn thing up.
Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint! Seriously, what the fuck are you developers doing?
Stop, please!
If you think it’s rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying “got to go, I’ll talk to you later”, then it’s also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one-off.
Things happen.
Maybe something came up and you got distracted, etc.
But every single person ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It’s really not that hard to just say “got to go, I’ll text you later” or “so-and-so just got home, talk to you later”.
Even just “bye” or “be right back” or something!
Today I got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if I did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn’t want to ignore them just to talk to me.
I said it wouldn’t be a problem if he had just said something like “I can’t talk right now” or “I’m with my friends, talk to you later” or just literally anything.
He then said I was overthinking stuff and I should “chill out”, so I left it at that.
So am I the asshole and overthinking things?
Am I the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend after he ignored me for a few days?
So I would usually post this on r/keto, but that subreddit is so intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But, like, a girl’s got to rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
I have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere, I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, calories please”.
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their “no cheat days” mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten-free dairy-free carbohydrate dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
As far I as I know, the concept of mini-album is only around in K-pop (maybe I-pop?).
I’m always disappointed when a long-awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5-song album.
I can tolerate a debut album, since you really don’t have a lot of material, but if you’re SNSD or something and you come out with mini after a years long hiatus like Mr.Mr, it’s kind of insulting.
I don’t know what to say, lol.
I’m pretty funny, not only because I manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often, but also because I’m just fucking hilarious to be honest.
I’m from Yorkshire, and that probably makes me cooler than you, because the North is just superior, and I’m ready to die on this hill, but I guess we can be mates.
I would really like some of those.
Ok, I’m running out of people to laugh at my jokes.
17M from the UK,
Please be able to hold a conversation, lol.
I don’t know what kind of dog this was, but it was so ugly.
My god, who would own such a thing?
Dogs with wrinkles like Pugs, Shar Peis (I don’t know how to spell it), Bulldogs, Boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all; I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally been told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness and over the nose, they can’t breathe)
And yes, I know I’m going to get shit on by all the fucking neckbeards on Reddit that just adore their snot nose little Pug.
I don’t even care.
I’m so tired of people and their dogs.
Every time I listen to him, shit makes so much sense, even though I don’t know what he is talking about.
That leads me to believe that either that guy is a genius who can articulate what’s going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something.
I mean what should I listen to if I really want to find out the truth, if Schiff is just “biased toward gold”, and that’s the reason why he is so hard on the current economy, etc.
Are boobs nice? Because, I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before.
Then he checks the oil level, saying that the oil also smells like gasoline, that gasoline and oil are mixing up together.
He opens one spark plug, sees the massive leak in there literally full up.
Let me say, oil smells like gasoline.
I didn’t smell that one.
That’s what the worker told me.
Then he call his boss, and the boss says it is not gasoline, it is just oil, “that shit smells like gasoline” 🤦🏾‍♂️
Even the worker confirmed that I’m not crazy, but ay, maybe I am.
And his worker told me he was going to seal the black thing that goes on top of the spark plug that covers it.
Sorry, my English is not that amazing.
He said he was putting a seal after draining the oil as he mentioned.
As oil drained, the oil sealed the thing so oil doesn’t drip out of it and doesn’t drip to the floor.
But it didn’t help me find the cause of why oil is getting into the spark plug, because a seal on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️
He tells me if the problem keeps on, it is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way too much oil and is causing the oil leak, that if the problems persist I will have to remove it.
Sorry for the long paragraph, but I need advice.
I need help to be honest.
My rabbit didn’t eat or drink, so I went to check him.
It’s been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food, I don’t know.
(He has constipation so I’m going to check if he poops.)
How do I sleep if I have to check on my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is going to become chaotic, lol.
I assume the time has already passed for this, but, I don’t know, I figured I may as well ask.
I kind of forgot I even had those tickets until they announced they’d be touring again today.
Now, my aunts (grandma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated grandma both before and after she passed.
When my grandma first started getting sick, my sister wasn’t the best, because she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but grandma was also scared of Covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job I couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back and forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
Would I be the asshole if I didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So I met this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dating.
Last night, everything was all right, she was happy said “good night” and “I love you” like every night.
And the next morning when I texted her good morning, she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad as fuck all day because of me but didn’t want to say why.
I don’t know what I did.
I did nothing.
What should I do?
How can I contact her?
Should I give her space?
My girlfriend blocked me, and I don’t know why.
Mine’s ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in which I have an F.
This is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I’ve done but are nowhere in the books,
This kind of snuck up on me, because I thought they were done and filed, only to check my grades and find out they weren’t.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you are going to say “I know right, I only have an 89, why couldn’t she round up? Fuck my life)
I’m going to be honest, that’s not very helpful right now.
So first off, Bard top.
What a pick, I know right?
Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like.
*my core is static/ie/RFC.
Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way.
I like to safely clear and lay out poke.
Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer.
Giving some more tank…
Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain.
I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade.
This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great.
If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy.
I’m tet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years, we’re both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It’s driving me crazy, how to deal with it?
This wouldn’t be an issue if all your servers asked at the beginning “do you guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.”
Also, why restaurants have to be set up like that? Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Hey guys, Bard main.
I just joined Reddit after finding out there are other off-meta Bards!
So I main him top.
Yes, it’s scary, but I do.
So I’ve been getting a lot of questions about my builds from friends and happy on-lookers lately!
I thought I’d share my builds!
I’m 16 years old, 5’9.
I’m new to basketball and I’d like to ask for drills I can do by myself so I can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I don’t have a decent shot nor a decent handle,
I could barely reach the backboard plus I have no friends so don’t even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why I wanted to be good at it so bad is because I just want people to know me as somebody, because right now I’m a nobody,
I want to be somebody.
P.S. I’ve never played an actual basketball ever in my life… I know, right?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising, you know) but pretty chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when I want to be), goofy, a little chaotic, big overthinker kind of deal.
Enneagram type 4, because apparently that matters (just kidding!).
I’m honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love... you get the gist :-)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist, so a program with medical school prerequisites would be preferable.
Plus, I plan to take my medical school abroad (wow, big dreams much?
I doubt I’d get in, but it wouldn’t hurt to try though).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me.
I’d be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh, and location too.
I’m short, so if my classes are far, I might as well rollerskate my way through campus, just kidding.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, you know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would’ve prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do.
The player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now, but I don’t know if I want to pursue her.
It’s complicated.
Right now its summer break, so I’m going to wait until school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person, because they don’t talk to me online, lol.
I don’t know how long this series will go, but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I don’t know how long this is going to take but probably quite a while.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I don’t have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say that if you’re a kid, like an elementary school kid and you’re here, where the fuck are your parents?
lol, never mind, fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Because I got them and no one to give them too, lmao, just kidding,  unless...
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium Sprite and a McDouble?
So I don’t know why I got on everyone’s nerves about the separate checks…
Hey, hi!
Haha... I’m new here, I didn’t know this existed until now.
I am extremely shy and don’t know what I’m doing here typing this, haha.
But hey, first time for everything right?
If we don’t click and you lose interest, then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry, lmao.
I don’t expect to get any messages, but hey, it’s worth a try.
P.S. I don’t know how to write these properly, so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format, oh my.
Oh and if I don’t reply soon, it might mean I’m asleep or playing DnD, hehe.
Never mind.
My internet is down right now.
Fuck.
Well I’m going to see if I can buy some stuff off Steam now...
Let’s hope there are still some good sales.
Okay, so I was a total noob and erased my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was going to use, but I sent Monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
Or how do you open the .key file?
Edit: never mind, I’m a complete noob.
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive Monero wallet seeds with a .keyfile?
user765123: No, I just had the “is now playing” thing show up.
A: I know.
A: Well, here we go.
A: “easily disturbed”, lol
A: Momma, help me.
A: Help me.
A: What’s the canon name?
user765123: ?
A: my name.
A: What’s the canon one?
user765123: There is none, pick whatever name you want.
A: Oh.
A: Am I a girl?
user765123: Male.
A: Argh.
<talking about their name here>
user765123: That seems like a good name.
user765123: lol
A: >:-)
user765123: (not that it really matters. I just used my real life name)
Comment
So I can guess your gender based on your post history.
Never mind… let me guess your gender instead.
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the professor is October 18.
(Edit: never mind, this part isn’t true, please disregard).
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is February 9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the professor that I’m dropping the course?
Do I also have to get permission?
I’m planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits by the way.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I really wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what?!” really loudly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “never mind”, because I felt like I was in the motherfucking spotlight.
But every time, my narcissistic mom says that it can’t be true, because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
“It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?”
Um, I don’t know, maybe it’s because we’re different people with different bodies?
To be honest, has anyone ever experienced fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn’t die and manage to kill a least one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch, but rampage didn’t pop his ult yet.
😲 What the fuck?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky as fuck fighter, and a carry that solos everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1
When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also.
I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in...
Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
Like now I feel guilty for smiling.
Never mind the fake ones shit, but fuck.
Haha. Ugh.
Why am I still alive?
lol, why the fuck does smiling hurt?
Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me.
I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible.
He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever.
I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions.
And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had.
I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting.
But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedely keep eating my food.
I do that for maybe 3 seconds.
Then I look back up.
Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds.
Edit: Yes, I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen. Useful, I know.
But ugh. They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
By the way, there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: never mind. I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance. Oops, now I’m not getting any MP!
Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!”
The message repeats every time I hit enter.
What the fuck!
I’m not cheating.
Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player.
10/10 I’m never playing again.
Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens.
I’m going to skip the Oscar-bait shit like The Post, because there’s only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Democrats making movies about how (extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) “politics used to be more polite. We need a return to the discourse.”
I’m sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas, but I’m just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns at the moment, but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior offensive line I think is a major problem, but there is no Nelson-like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there, that’s really the only situation where I absolutely stay put.
2 months ago, I bought a cheap ’95 Nissan truck.
I was only locally driving, so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn’t put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm.
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd only when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can’t rev it past 3k in my driveway without feeling like I’m going to break something,
I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it.
It’ll hit close to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule out what could be causing this power-sap, i.e. is it the air or fuel or a clogged cat or exhaust, etc. or something entirely different?
I ruled out “different”, I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone else’s narcissistic mom treat you like you’re overreacting about your period pains?
Hey! I read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangerous.
Is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2-month Boston Terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.
My friends think she said that because she was with her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up, etc.
Others think it’s a way for her to be evil, like think of me, because I’m never coming to get that charm.
I think it’s some type of hoover, good or bad.
Any insight is appreciated.
If you’re a woman, please tell me your perspective.
So confused, but she is clearly with someone else, and why couldn’t she call me back and why didn’t she respond to my text messages?
She could’ve said “I’m with my boyfriend, please don’t call me”, but she didn’t.
Just a side note: my boyfriend and I are buying a house.
We will be moving out in 2 months.
Once the papers are all finalized.
I have an Australian Shepherd, 9 months.
My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) got her at 3 months.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with, a black Labrador and a small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a Rat Terrier.
Their play style is boxing.
And one of my room mates (25M) has a Beagle.
He doesn’t like to play much.
In fact, he seems kind of scared too.
I know all of these things about my dog.
I know that it doesn’t matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise, doesn’t matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business.
What matters is that my dog is nervous.
So when I hold my hand out and tell you, “no, he’s not sitting or lying down because he’s calmly waiting for you to say hi, it’s because he’s nervous and insecure”,  I don’t mean it as a joke, and it’s not an invitation for you to say, “aw, well my dog/child is very friendly, so let me approach!”
I don’t care if your dog/child is friendly or “dog savvy”.
I don’t care if your dog “is just a puppy”.
(why the hell is that even relevant?
Is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies?).
I don’t care if your child is capable of not screeching “oh my God, a puppy”.
Can you, you know, do something about your child? And also your dog?
But with less than 3 months to go for that, I feel I’m not ready yet, but having never taken it, I have nothing to compare it to besides colleagues’ advice.
Without knowing what I know, they can’t know if I’m actually ready yet, but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this bad and it would be awesome to be done 6 months from my introductory exam.
I’m close... I just don’t know if I’m 2 months study close.
Some certified advice.
(M/5’10”/26/165-195lbs) 2 months progress, am I gaining too much weight?
I passed my FAA PPL written!
I know this sounds weird, but here’s my issue.
About 4 months ago, I had an 3700X which died after start, crashing when I tried to play games, and a day later not booting.
I sent to RMA, they confirmed the CPU was dead and gave my money back after 2 months.
After that I got an 3800X.
As soon as I tried, I got the boot code 7b, everything powered up but no reboots or video signal.
I sent to RMA this time with the store.
After 1 month they confirmed the CPU was faulty and sent me a new one.
I got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom (T) has always been the type where her feelings matter first and only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone else’s fault entirely.
For example: I needed someone to babysit our then 2-month-old for 3-4 hours.
Dad’s work had someone who had Covid.
We opted out of them watching our son and asked my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her before I set it all up, because I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its my fault and she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her days after the incident, because she didn’t call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing,
T promptly got off the phone.
I never got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to T’s narcissism.
I don’t expect an apology from T, because she never has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5 months, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2 months, he’s co-slept with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I’ve been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get a 2-month baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (currently replacing pacifier every hour).
First time mother to a sweet 2-month-old girl, and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
First time mother struggling with sleeps.
So I already have an orange golden chinchilla (Toto, 2 months old) and we have had Toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got Terri (2-month Himalayan Ragdoll) to keep each other company.
It’s only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor.
Just always going “brr rrr rrr”.
I’m not sure if she has a blocked nose, because Toto never made this kind of sound...
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
I can’t play until tomorrow but would like to know, so I can make money hunting or robbing everything and everyone.
How much do pelts sell for online?
Alright everyone, I think I mis-tagged this earlier, so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily with a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, and lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running (I have no issue with being over 12 feet from other people - I usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then I have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually I’m quietly confident going into these games but with injuries, players missing etc., I’m kind of happy if we get a draw.
I know they’re utter piss and paper-wise, we should be wiping the floor with them, but I’m just not feeling the 2/3-nil vibe at the moment!
Anyone want to talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
This is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait never mind, shit meme.
I was 6 and playing Lego Rock Band,
I decided to ask for the Buddy Holly pack.
My parents (despite being in their 40’s) said “how the shit do you know that?”
I never realised that my parents got into Weezer.
So that’s how I got into Weezer.
I genuinely don’t understand how “toxic” behavior is more punished than literally int or troll.
Well, I’ve had an account which always received those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until I got in a bad streak of losses in ranked, and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior.... And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in-game chat for toxic behavior after a report doesn’t understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait until the morning, but then I said “never mind, I just realized it’s almost 2.
I’ll just wait”.
And then he asked what would happen if I ate it right now and I said nothing.
It’s just too late.
Now he’s telling me to just say “fuck it” and just eat the cereal.
So inspiring, but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :-(
Before I realized it was 2.
Help, lol, oh wait, I can just Google it.
Never mind, lol
How to delete a subreddit.
I know your skin isn’t perfect or you’re insecure about your nose or looks.
But those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You’re beautiful, because you’re you.
Rant over.
Actually, never mind.
God, why did you give me this huge ass nose?
I’m too ugly to even rant on Snapchat, so I do it on Reddit instead.
Ok, it’s over now. Hopefully.
Can I get an RIP in the chat boys?
I was trying to go to sleep, because I couldn’t, when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked, but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says, because she only said my name in all caps and then a “never mind”.
Fuck.
I just realized I’m complaining over a 5-minute fix…
I had never heard of this “influencer” before and consider myself pretty internet savvy.
I then lost interest in her, because her Instagram wasn’t that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread, and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out, and then I took a great interest in checking in on her, because I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while:
How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her lots of money, because she claims to not be able to afford food or rent or whatever, when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers, which aren’t cheap.
I don’t like him or anything, but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my boyfriend with him.
I wouldn’t do that to him of course, but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
Me: I’m highkey liking boys more right now.
lol, this is no culture.
I’m still trying to fucking finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.
And it’s my actual birthday tomorrow, lol.
This is not meant as a rant.
It’s only just informing Oro mains that they look noobs whenever they play Oro.
Never mind, I guess this is a rant.
Never mind, it’s back up.
That’s like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying “ah, never mind, I want to eat somewhere else” as soon as they’re bringing the food out.
I played a game as Rengar and I was 6/2 and got solo killed by Anvia who didn’t have Rod of Ages or Tear finished yet.
I looked over at the replay 100 times and all I can think to my self is, if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did, the Anivia will win CNA.
Someone please explain why the fuck an Anivia is strong than a Rengar in a 1v1 when the Rengar has a gold lead?
Actually, never mind. I don’t care.
I’m just quitting this brain dead game.
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage and both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds and says “never mind”, so I just gave her mine and went on with my day.
I’m so sick of hearing the same beats of Mexican music, ahh!
Edit: I lied: the party started at 8 am and the music stopped just now at 7:30 pm.
God, if I have to go through this every weekend, I’ll just kill myself.
Edit 2: lol, 10 minutes later, never mind, the music started again.
What the fuck!
Edit 3: It started raining, so the party ended haha!
People go in the dark alone.
No one could be that stupid!
If there’s a ghost in the house, why the hell would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a little too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they’re screwed.
4. The fuck are you splitting up for?!
There’s always this one guy in horror movies that’s like: “Guys, there’s a crazy ass killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed”!
That’s exactly what the killer wants!
Basically, I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again because my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her), and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this Reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh never mind, he’s good” and “P90 is broken. I’m quitting the game”.
lol, never mind, I’m still here. I can’t sleep.
lmao, it’s just me, never mind.
Just what the title says.
Do you pick up insects and spiders with your bare hands?
I’m deathly afraid of insects and spiders, so I don’t know what to do.
I want to kill them before they get away.
Play a scuffed 24-hour WOW livestream filled with condescending undertones, belittling, and shitty half-assed ill-prepared gameplay. Throw begging, depression and sob stories on top of it and call it couples stream.
An Altarian virus, anything is possible.
In fact, that day on Onias Three, you were infected with the cell of its hosts ten days ago.
You have been in a coma, delirious.
Your fever broke this morning.
I don’t have one, because I’m 17 and haven’t gotten around to it (and no, I’m not driving, because I’m terrified) and that I haven’t gotten my gender marker changed, so no updated documents at all.
I have a passport from a while ago from before transitioning, so that doesn’t have an updated name either.
So I have no idea what to do, because I’m going to an event with them on the 14th.
If it helps, my dad’s a flight attendant (has been for like ever).
Should I cancel?
There is always next year, but, like, I’m lonely in real life, because my boyfriend is an hour away, and as much as I love my other real life buddies, I’d like a breath of fresh air :-(
I don’t know if I will.
If I do, I will be in my mid 30’s, because I want to live life my way.
But I need to have sex to have kids and that isn’t going to happen (because honestly “me too”).
I have to go camping for a scuba certification.
There is a grill and they will eat burgers.
But I am on a vegetarian diet.
(I eat some animal products but much less than I did before.
I eat 80% vegetarian)
I got pretty close with an equalizer with a little low end and high end shaved off, going into a soft clipper.
The equalizer before it makes it Slam.
I was going to try distortion and a limiter after, when I get off work.
(The limiter was highly suggested in the last post, so hopefully that’ll do the trick) I’m just looking for advice!
What should I do from here?
Someone please let me know.
You can easily get an infinite powerlock in longer fights.
I have a 4/40 Dr Octopus, and I see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and SPS, so not bad in damage either (like vision).
A very viable option for AW attack. and also arenas, as you don’t have to bait out in those small fights, because you never let them reach SP3 before you finish it.
Get ready boys.
Pogo will not open for me.
It keeps saying this device is blah blah blah… you guys know what I’m talking about.
Anyway, to fix this, I am on Android 6.0 before the security update and I have root with Magisk 16.0.
Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise, what with having a storyline that doesn’t come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and necessary amount of seriousness and comedy.
The characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert, Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events don’t always have to rely on Neptune’s presence.
Great bait, mate. I relate, straight appreciate, and congratulate.
I rate this bait an 8/8.
Please no hate,
I’m straight irate.
Create more,
Can’t wait.
We should conversate.
I won’t berate.
My number is 8888888,
I’ve taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take no more.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: Meh, ok, that’s fine.
They then use shit like A subtract 1 through A subtract 20 for variables.
In fact, I have a linear algebra book that did this... A’s for everything.
The pages were just matrices filled with A’s.
Just draw a weird shape or something - anything but that shit!
Scariest thing ever mate.
Well, well, here we are again, frustrated, angry in front of my phone.
What a neat way to start isn’t it?
All of you readers are my therapy and I don’t owe you a cent.
Perfect, right?
If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all because of your short attention span, so let’s keep it short (what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying “keep it short - I’m a genius aren’t I?”)
Well I tried explaining to my buddies that porn is kind of shabby, and yeah just bad, and you know who listened…
Hey, I just want to know what games I can run on this PC and which not.
I was a spy, and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told the jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, Mafia and Serial Killer had made their kills.
I proudly said: “I was attacked while in jail!”
Wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and asks me “You were attacked while you were in jail?” and I answer “yes mate”.
He then tells me that what I am saying is bullshit, because Serial Killer and Mafia have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously?!
Like, I don’t really care what mean, shit people on the internet say.
But when I got nobody in real life, all I have is the internet, and it does kind of hurt a bit when I just want to vent my problems.
And I’d be fine if it got maybe a single upvote and no comments, and I’d be fine.
But instead, it’s full of people saying
Oh boy, you are too dumb for the movie, boy.
The director was like “shit, it’s about the hidden meanings you have to find, boy, like you know it doesn’t spoon-feed you the film, you know?”
Like shit, why does it have to explain, mate.
Just imagine what happened, you know?
It’s not like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has, you know?
Yet when fully charged for the first 30-60 minutes, it’s always on!
Which is beautiful!
Lastly, if I do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping), the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off.
What the fuck, mate?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone, or is it just me?
In searching Google, I cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues, I am really enjoying the mod.
It’s just a fucking ball ache every single time I want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before I can puff...
Every time I log on, I want to chill away from keyword NMZ, and play Xbox and be fat, right, but lately I log on, play RS away from keyword for like 20 seconds and I get logged out, and it’s fucking annoying.
Is it my internet connection or is it the servers or what?
It’s pissing me off, mate.
Next we have my statistics class, and I didn’t realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework; and so my grade was a 70 something, and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my band class is basically easy A as it’s show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert, and so I passed that. Good game, easy, mate.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do not go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like “what the fuck, mate?” and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after, I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there.
Did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This year’s rookie game is actually going to be real exciting.
What line-ups do you want to see?
I love this show, but sadly I’m near to finishing it already.
What is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story?
I never watch movies or… so sorry about my lack of vocabulary on this though, is this called dystopian?
Well I’m really lost, but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy!
Has it happened to anyone else?
It happened to me a number of times.
So if you’re on leg 2, you have to win 10 consecutive games for the XP and coins, 10 stamina for 40 tickets.
Get the fuck out of here, EA!
Her: Oh, where’s this ice luge, haha?
Me: Probably my friend’s hotel room or wherever he can find a place for it.
Me: I came to <insert city> with my fraternity and a sorority – that’s why he’s getting it.
Her: Gotcha!
Her: What fraternity and sorority I’m in xxx.
Me: yyy. sorority is zzz.
Me: You’re interesting though.
I want to hang out with you.
When this week?
Her: Uh, maybe Friday?
Me: Ah, yes.
Me: Friday.
*one day later*
Me: <girl’s name>, we’re hanging out tomorrow, right?
I don’t like when people type huge paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me about their problems.
I don’t like when people mumble on the phone or if they ramble on, and it’s all about them.
But now it just doesn’t make sense. You only get 1 ticket per match, and if you are lucky, you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the one thing free-to-play was always able to do because of the low cost of entrance and the rewards were good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you don’t like him, use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you don’t like the new WT, then don’t play it.
Closed tech support?
It’s, 1:30am and you’re a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
What the literal fuck?
Was your heating bill too much this month so you can’t make your rent?
You mismanaged bunch of fools.
So, long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall ’22 semester, and I’m on the waitlist since April.
Housing isn’t guaranteed when you’re not a freshman, and my income isn’t enough for rent so…
There’s a possibility, I might be homeless.
My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No fucking competition.
Most men this day are thirsty as fuck.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half-assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains, they grab and grunt at everything with two legs.
And I mean that literally.
But – that’s good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24M), an accountant at a traveling company.
We ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today I called one of our agents and a girl picked up.
She was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts, and she said “yes, I will be at your company at 21:00”.
I said “ok, and at 21:00, she came by and asked who is the accountant”.
I said “I am, please follow me to the room”.
She came and I asked her how much did she bring.
She said “I have $1300 with me”, which will not cover all of their debts by the way, so I brought a receipt and wrote down the amount and the company name and then I asked her for her name.
She smiled and looked at me and said my name.
So none of my friends are answering me 😭😭
So, it’s time to make some new ones!
I’m in the mood to call, so let me know if you’re down!
Looking to talk to people around my age.
I’ve posted before so you can check out my profile for more info.
I’m a little lazy right now 🥴
Anyways, let me know what your favorite type of music is 🙃
I had been wearing Lane Bryants Lounge Bras the past four-ish years, and so this was the first time in a very long time that I wore a bra with wire.
So come Monday, I wore my new bra with wire that fit perfectly at the store, but after a few hours it felt so uncomfortable!
I am worried I wasted my money… :-(
I’m so miserable and seriously just want to cancel my trip but don’t want to disappoint my husband.
He’s been looking forward to a vacation for so long.
I’m dreading the plane ride so bad!
Luckily the flare is a bit higher and not right where I make contact when sitting, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.
I’m going to be walking around in 40 degree weather with a big angry boil on my ass.
God help me 😫
Hey, there.
I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of “you” or “your”, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
Just type out the word.
It isn’t hard.
Hi guys, I was drinking with my friends from the US and my boyfriend and everyone’s fallen asleep, and I want to play some truth or dare or drink, so if you have Discord or Kik, just message me, owo
So I just had my baby with the man of my dreams 4 months ago :-) and it felt like I was living my fairytale life.
I was in my exact vision I had, but then, long story short, postpartum with new emotions had me pull a crazy move and I checked his phone about a month ago now, only to find out he was meeting up with a  chick, doing favors for her, spending time in her room and texting a lot, all while I was pregnant.
Now he and her both say they are just friends and never hooked up (yes, I contacted her number), lol, but I don’t want to lose my man, though I also saw he has dating profiles and he says he doesn’t do it all the time.
And he won’t do it anymore.
I don’t want my baby’s parents to split, plus I love him and want our vision to carry on.
But how?
Please help.
Can I? Or should I trust him again ?
Day 17 of posting Corgi stuff (sorry for not posting for so long)
I have insomnia and I can’t sleep at night, and it’s just like I have so many ideas at night that just so many ideas keeping my up at night.
Please tell me how sometimes I can get better sleep.
Because of that, I almost failed school and because of skipped lessons, and people tell me to listen, but just, like, I talk with somebody, and then I just think of something.
I forgot what I was about to say, and I had a math tutor, but iI couldn’t focus and just also my mind is like chaos people.
Tell me.
Oh, I don’t want to take medication and I’m sensitive to medicine.
Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that.
She probably already has one also.
A real digital movie camera costs so damn much.
So I opted for an analog one.
Now, 8mm/Super 8 have an affordable price, 16mm doesn’t cost much, and 35mm costs a lot, so I think I’m going for a Super 8.
But then how does it work?
lol, I mean, I buy her a Super 8, but I should also buy her a video recorder, and some VHS… things like that.
I don’t know how it works.
Please can someone explain to me what should I do.
How do you guys do it?
It’s so scary, but I want to last forever with him, and I know I can’t tell the future, but we’ve been through so much together.
How do you guys keep it going through all the obstacles life throws at you... how?
Do you want to run some Minecraft? XD
I’m bored and my friends are busy or out right now, so...
I finished the game for the first time today.
What a wonderful and amazing game.
It hits right in the feels and fucks your mind up at times.
My ending was sad.
Kara and Alice die (I am bad at controls), North dies, Hank dies, Marcus is successful, but I let Connor kill him, because I guess I was doing kind of a role-play where Connor is the villain and the outcome is realistic.
I will try to open other openings.
But yes, the game was so good.
Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!
Maybe a little earlier, I don’t know, because I’m usually at work, but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mb/s range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more people are at home I’m going to see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60…
I am an aspiring doctor/medical student, and so seeing a lot of medicine-related subjects as early in our first semester I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!
I passed for UPLB BS Biology!
To be honest though, this wasn’t my priority program, so of course I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be a scholar, but I was also worried, because I’m not really as interested in Biology as invested I already was in Physical Therapy.
Sure, I could learn to love Biology, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year, but that’s not certain.
I will play with anyone on 2K21.
I’m an 87 over 3 level scorer. As one that will play with anyone, REP and OVR don’t matter.
I have no one to play with most of the time, and no randoms want to play with me.
Please play with me.
I promise I won’t sell.
I can shoot.
I have an 81 three, but I can shoot.
I’m a shooting guard.
I need someone who knows how to land planes on PC to help me.
That’s all.
I just need you to land the plane.
I know how to do the rest of the mission, but the plane has been messing me up for hours.
Please help as soon as possible.
My discord is SingSong254.
Contact me there, then I’ll give you my Ubisoft account information.
Thanks.
Help, I need someone who knows how to fly planes well on PC to join me.
Let’s fucking go!
What’s up guys?
I drop around 30 kills a game right now, and I’m trying to get out of low ranks and get into Platinum.
If you’re good at the game but simply don’t have a Stack, add me on Discord and we can rank up together.
Just to clarify, when I say “anything” I mean anything within the FM’s current power.
So no answers like “remove the nukes” or “boot the royals”.
We cannot do that (not yet at least…).
You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.
What do you do?
Me and my real life friends need a team that we (or especially I) can VOD review in order to learn about tarping, switching layers and positioning.
I was thinking Wolf/Soldier/Wilkinson but I’m not sure if there are any better ones.
Preferably EU as we are EU, and some stuff happening is basically exclusive to EU, lol, but I guess it could be NAE as well.
Thank you!
Looking for someone to play with right now.
No toxics and no obnoxious people.
I don’t fuck with that.
18+ NAE.
I just play for fun.
You can be bad.
I don’t care about skills 😇
One word I simply can’t say properly is water...
It actually hurts my brain trying to add the T, and I sound American if I do or still say wut-ta.
I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to say, to be honest.
I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when you meet people who drop H’s and have glottal stops.
I’m curious how likely it is that a post on my personal space will be shown to people.
Please write  “+” in the comment if you see this.
So I got a Sky Q Mini Box for upstairs.
It doesn’t work.
I have to wait until late March for an engineer.
lol
So I will be starting a job next week and desperately need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
Looking for single bedroom flats or flat-shares is a legitimate issue as three letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
Vacuum won’t stop sucking. Please send help. Is it going to blow?
Basically, if you didn’t know what that is, it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Let’s eat granny” making it seem like someone’s going to eat their nan.
However, the other example says “Lets eat, granny”, implying a different meaning to the sentence.
A pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas, I guess.
I literally couldn’t have been more at fault
I just drove straight into this woman’s Golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it).
She seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it’s my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers as well, just very minor body work and paint, maybe a small dent.
What broadband do I get?
I’ve had Virgin for 8 years, and holy shit, is it slow for £40 monthly.
Is it the old router or do I just switch to a cheaper BT or whatever?
Jeans, T-shirt, steel-cap boots, boiler suit (lol), high vis, gloves, goggles, dust mask, ear protection.
Help. I’m melting…
Edit: the heat has got to my spelling ability first. The end is nigh.
I’m sure as eggs is eggs that I’m not the only one that goes to the gas pump, and I want say £10, 9 times out of 10 it will go £10.01.
Bloody things are rigged like a slot machine, I swear, lol.
lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn’t actually laugh to.
LOL - adults and people who don’t really know how the internet works use this
Lol - I’m not sure why this came up, but it’s likely an autocorrect, but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named.
LoL - Grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
It’s also confusing because of League of Legends.
loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with “spool”, but I think it’s the drawn-out “o”.
So yeah, I think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn’t exist.
lolll - when I hear her say “loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it. but I still think that’s “loool”,
You can’t repeatedly pronounce a consonant.
So, when is Big Ben going to bong again?
Hm, mandatory title.
But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Preferably under £50!
Also, does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming (that don’t require me to stand for lengths of time).
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what I do, I literally can’t keep the dust at bay for more than 24 hours, and I am losing my mind.
It’s 10pm, 28°C, and my bum is literally melting.
Saturday session three and chat.
If this bear isn’t named Beary McBearface, we have failed as a society.
It’s 32°C here inside my flat.
I have taken the t-shirt off and soaked it in cold water.
I’m wearing it.
What genius ways are you keeping cool whilst working from home or somewhere extremely hot with no AC?
Bloody lovely fucking weather, isn’t it?
16 hours in Wetherspoons.
Okay, so I went out with my girlfriend to go to 7-11 and I had my hair in my face, a hoodie, and a mask, and someone called me he/him.
Bruh, I’m so happy right now, what the fuck (I’m non-binary and use all pronouns, but nobody has ever used he/him for me and it feels really good)
To the neighbor that went out of their way just to check on me, I appreciate that.
I just wanted to say from one Gen Z to Millennials, good on you guys.
I hope you find what you’re looking for. It’s been fun being your little buddies in life.
If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet, everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really, to be honest.
Remember, there’s a lot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that doesn’t experience a lot of positive moments, this subreddit does make me smile :-)
Damn, some people need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet, Jesus!
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kind of a lot, lol), so I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I don’t see the need, because who the fuck cares?
But now it seems that you’re all making grits without the butter and making us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were preparing to tour more plantations than Carter’s got little pills but you done gone and brought up them “slave owners” now.
It isn’t amounting to anything more than a hill of beans!
If I had my druthers, I’d have just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt something decent about history.
All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
You get along now, do you hear?
How to go from number to date?
How do I break off a relationship with my “friend”?
Basically, I put my skate account in my Instagram biography, because I have no posts on my main, and I’m kind of insecure about my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless, and people won’t expect me to be like shredded or some shit if they add me), and today I got 3 followers (girls from different towns who don’t know me).
I’m really picky though, because I don’t want to have a relationship, unless I actually feel like I’d really like the person and be into them a lot, so I didn’t follow any of them back.
Bro, I’ve been added and un-added on Instagram so many times today that it’s kind of a confidence boost, lmao.
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from people who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers, smh…
I have nothing else to say, come at me angry people, lmao.
Hi guys, I’m a casual just-for-fun gamer, playing 5-6 games a week.
Yesterday it was just pure horror division 10…
I could not win 1 game out of 6…
Like, is everyone smurfing ?
Or what’s going on?
I know people want to play the objective.
I get that, but why do you need to shush or watch full replay or every cut scene?
So basically, for my A-levels I got 82 RP and wanted to go the NUS business administration but didn’t get in, though I’m quite sure my grade is good enough, and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago… *welp* :-(
I got into SMU business administration, but I still feel damn shit that I didn’t get into NUS, so help change my mind and convince me why SMU is better than NUS, especially for business :-/
I’m most scared that in the future when I’m working, people will look down on SMU like elitism discrimination all that, I don’t know, man.
Or will they pay less or not even hire me?
RIP, because SMU is kind of 2nd best and less well known.
I would really appreciate if you all could help me out, especially those who are currently at university or have already left.
Thanks pals :-)
TLDR: the title.
Other vegans that you’re friends with tell you that they don’t tell other people that they’re vegan.
Like, they purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community, because they are probably the people that would be more gentle with their words, which is what some people need in order to listen.
I’m a very straightforward, no sugarcoating type of person, and although some people appreciate it, a lot more get upset and start trying to put words in my mouth and twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like €300 worth of fake internet points, like, what the fuck are you doing, honestly? lol
Why would you give awards to people? lol
I just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre-googling and confirmed the time that I’ll be there.
If she gives any further resistance, I think I’ll just next her, ignore her, not respond to her, agree with her that she can’t handle the place, or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first freaking date.
Yes, I agree things like Tumblr made-up identities are weird, and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted, calling people snowflakes is just weak.
Give yourself a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without any unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series! Props to you!
The New Year’s Eve Raticate with a hat.
I haven’t found him anywhere yet.
Does anyone want to raid?
I need a few people quick.
Stop.
I think what I am trying to say… this game is not hard.
Don’t make it hard yourself.
The main objective, as I understood, is to get the dragon, and don’t die before that.
Even better if you outfarm your opponent.
Just don’t die.
And trades in lane… if you see the enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights, but he was out of town.
So we couldn’t do that, and now he’s back in town, and I asked him what he’s doing on New Year’s Eve and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers from our work.
And like, he didn’t offer an invite, and then he said if he cancels with them, would I like to come over, and I just said I don’t know what I’m doing yet, so I don’t know.
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There are going to be people on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid.
Hey, the regulars!
I just wanted to say that I love the group channel, it’s amazing, and love your own channels as well.
I love all your videos, and I have a suggestion for a video for the channel:
Do a Minecraft build battle and whoever loses there, the other people get to write something on their Twitter, lol.
I hope you like my idea and can use it for a video.
I have a group chat.
It’s on Discord for people who are bored or want to chat about anything.
We already have some people who chat and stuff about anything.
It’s chill, edgy, and if you want to join, comment and I’ll direct message you the link.
I just kind of realized that I’ve never had New Year’s Eve plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that…
I recently realized that I still don’t have enough friends to have one for my 21st coming up…
I don’t know why I didn’t clue into this though.
Like, I never thought about how people have traditions for this night, besides my sister, who goes out to her friends’ every year.
It’s funny that Covid isn’t affecting my New Year at all…
Is anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway, I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight, lol.
Hello, I’m looking for people to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
Just please be aware that I’m not very good at upholding conversations. uwu F/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the Word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the “aaa” word, and I want to yank four words without selecting the spaces after “ddd”:  > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like, I see videos on YouTube on it.
But like, I can’t see any mention on the design notes, etc.
Where do people get the information from?
DM me to debate.
Please be well learned in your belief.
I want DMs, because it’ll get deep and I can’t reply to 300 people like that.
Also, I need 500 characters so here come the blah blahs.
I’m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I’m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl, but I am saying that they won’t like to do it, because they are humans with their own choices, and not agreeing to be a girl isn’t making them a women anti.
Like, how many guys around you would be willing to be turned into Disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time but how much time?
And maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
But knowing this isn’t making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they are asked to do all this.
I wouldn’t like it if you tried to make me a man and wanted me to dance in front of so many people, even though I am a tomboy.
Is anyone missing me?
If you miss a Reddit friend, read this.
It could be me!
So I just hopped on PC from PS4, not even 2.5k games played there.
I played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a keyboard and mouse, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with people 2000 kills and predators even.
Yet I haven’t even a hundred games played and about 80 kills with all characters.
I’m not really having fun anymore.
I can’t improve if I get shit on every game.
I see a lot of people on here who seem hella sad, so if you’re really sad, I’m up for a chat.
So yeah if you are up for a chat, or long-term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so.
So I always see people talk about sending designs and edits to Affinity, but how do I do that?
I’ve worked at OD for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it.
Like not even the print suppliers.
We do every type of editing in store and I hate it.
Like we’re out here doing stuff that I’m pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to Affinity based on what I see on here.
But yeah, is more of this information on the store portal or where can I learn more?
I’m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last-minute, rude customers :-)
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k, and I was like “Hell no, that’s not worth 100k”, like bruh.
Why do people find the new set expensive?
I know the girl I posted about is a troll people, but oh well, she’s got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down.
It is the bar with the team composition and the status of each character that is used to follow “report team” (like in the actual World Cup).
It can be tweaked down to not reveal too much information about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier, and you won’t have to use tab.
Hit me up with a chat message.
Tell me about yourself and we can go from there.
I don’t understand how people can build what they do...
I love building but I guess my creativity isn’t well tuned as a lot of people’s is, and it bothers me that I can’t build amazing stuff.
I know I could if had the creative side, ugh!
I just tend to give up after a while and settle for simple crap to pass for ok.
I care about how I affect people a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in conversations with big groups of people, which is related to ADHD.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kind of stand-offish to people I don’t know.
I’ll try to act like I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me but drunk people will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all are ADHD things though, because of rejection sensitive dysphoria.
I’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent.
I can have a really, really, really flirty personality at times.
I remember in high school, my friend’s mom said I had the “personality”, so I’d probably be the first to have a boyfriend.
But when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds her accountable, she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects anyone/everyone who doesn’t agree with her and screams about how she doesn’t care.
Or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck”.
She’ll never take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite.
All the things she screams at people to not do to her, she turns around and does the exact same rude, petty shit to anyone/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her.
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts just like my mom, and my mom can’t stand it/accept that
So she becomes downright nasty.
In class, I’ve usually been really quiet, but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click with in class and be really, really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen B, feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk though.
I’ve always been a smiley, happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have ADHD.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really, really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk - I heard people with ADHD are both.
Could I be ISTP?
Help type me please.
I don’t know if people would even want to.
I just want to know if that’s allowed, and if not, where would be a good place to post that.
(I’ve watched Dragonmar and other people’s videos but that would be hard to be a me-specific video on there)
Like in a good way though.
Some people are just indescribable.
I haven’t done this before, but I’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like…interests :-)
We can definitely talk about anime (especially romance - I’m a sucker for it), we can talk about games and go into detail about lore and stuff, creepy stories go hard, and really I’m just down for anything :-)
I’m not gonna be weird so long as you’re not weird.
Any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah… if I didn’t do this right let me know :-)
Oh and I’ll absolutely talk more on Snap.
The part I’m humming is like “word word word wo-o-o-ord” twice.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like “fly-y-y-yyy.”
I’m pretty sure it’s a popular song; I’ve heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah, to be honest it is.
I care about a lot of people and I can’t just... make people be happy.
But like… I want to :-(
I just want to make everybody I care about happy.
Like, is that too much to ask?
I think that some people here are AI or something.
smh, don’t even try.
I can do that by myself 🤠
Hey, F/19, bored as fuck.
I enjoy talking to new people.
Hit me up!
I started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90’s.
She said everyone was watching wrestling back then, and it was a cool thing.
Now no one gives a shit 😭 (I don’t really blame them sometimes).
I asked her “why do you think people stopped liking it”, and she said “because it’s garbage.
It’s come on Fox on Fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hits, I change the channel”.
I had to include that in there, because she’s so funny 😂😂😂
Anyways…
Hey, I can’t fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting.
Hit me up if you think we could hit it off well.
I hope we have a great time, future chat buddy ;-) 😁
It’s kind of weird, I’m not going to lie.
These motherfuckers can outrun, outswim or outstam (through venom) anything that tries to get them.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
I just finished the show so I’m a little behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much, lol.
Also by sidestory I mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
My favorite Obama quote: “Michael and I also want to… uh… acknowledge… uh… uh… uh… your son Jack, who deployed today.”
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.
I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best games ever that I have played!
But I have some problems…
I’d always heard of Mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple of months ago, and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists right now.
Anyway, those were just my thoughts.
Happy New Year’s everyone!
I hope the new year treats you well.
Now for this one, it’s kind of hard, because the enemies are so cool for this game, but...
If I had to choose, I’d say I like the clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not the only enemy in the game that doesn’t have a single other variation from what I remember.
Honestly, I wasn’t going to make one, but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I disagree with a lot of others’ lists.
Not to say that my list is right, because this is all subjective anyway, which is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
Yay!
In my opinion, Lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind I’ve only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of episode 3).
Unlike her father, Lily tries to work with Lee and for the most part the group.
She does what she has to.
She is a bit of a bitch, because she has to.
I only have 1 problem with Lily.
She killed Carly.
If you could get Ben to confess… Yes, I got spoiled on that and a few other things.
Ben is useless.
He is what looks like a college student, yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7.
Please don’t downvote me into oblivion if I missed something.
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats.
So 4 isn’t really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kind of sucks in my opinion.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who has lived both as a woman and as a man.
(Not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
So that’s kind of neat in my opinion.
I don’t think he did the role justice.
I feel before Neo figured it out, the way he was speaking was ok, but after… in my opinion, he should have gone full Hugo Weaving speech.
I just wanted to share my opinion not being a United fan, on the game against Burnley.
(Not that many of you will care).
McTominay - sheesh, what a guy.
I thought that Shaw was solid.
Now you’ve got two good left backs in good form.
Also I wanted to say AWB had a much better game, I thought.
After the shitty games and Dalot playing well I personally thought AWB improved a lot.
Haha. Oh my god, it’s terribly funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can only drop at 4-6, Yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues, but for me I can live with those issues but not this.
Please change!
It’s kind of an odd question in my opinion, but I have a ball python who I just got to eat frozen/thawed for the first time (yay!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I’ve tried frozen/thawed large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
It could be a fluke though.
I know it’s like a meme or something of “Dark Souls player complains about the combat” or something similar, but I just don’t get the combat.
I can do DS3 Deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately.
I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.
Oh my God!
Why do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they don’t have any idea of how a torrent even works (it’s so damn easy though!).
Comments like “The link doesn’t work”, rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
You’re just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤 Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So I get tipped on the app, they gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the application after?
What the fuck is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before, but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was less than the app tip...
If you are tipping both, tip both.
Not going to lie, Teamfight Tactics is a good mode, but it’s like Hearthstone a good game to play on your phone, not something to grind out all day all night, like what the fuck?
It’s not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on, prep up and alt tab until it’s next time you can do anything).
Any thoughts?
I know it’s a scientific things and all, but some of the posts there are just too much.
Learning dream languages?
What the fuck?
And some bloke is saying “I tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didn’t lucid dream?!” every few hours.
Maybe the posts are just getting a little too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like “Dear lord, what the fuck is happening, ooh”.
So I am a first time cup user, and I got the Saalt cup at Target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today, and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold + 17 year-old virgin = ow).
I got it in with the 7-fold, and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how the fuck am I supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails?
In one way, it kind of helped me find the cup lowkey grip, but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping.
I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes.
Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop).
Then I walked back and forgot my groceries.
I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill.
I live on a hill.
Down.
In the middle, really.
I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco.
So I walked back and got them.
No crime round these parts.
Not much, anyway.
I didn’t think about nails...
Is he going to tell her?
If so how would that conversation go down?!
Okay, what the fuck!
Arlo now knows Sera (I don’t know how to spell her full name) is John’s weakness.
First of all, we’ve seen they are greedy as fuck (OK, not as much other mobile studios, but still).
Second, the game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high-end phones).
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
What the fuck are you Yanks on?
See also: (on an article about how it’s “40 degrees in some parts of Europe”) > what the fuck, lol, that’s not hot at all.
Put on a jacket, dummies!
(“[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16°C”) > Oh my God, that’s really cold.
I’m never moving to canada.
Sometimes it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me the fuck out and gives me nods similar to codeine.
Why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with whether or not a woman looks at me and thinks I’m ugly.
If that happens, I get anxious from it.
But if a women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks I’m decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
What the fuck is going on?
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisible, even if they don’t detect you, they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I should’ve just grabbed a submachine gun and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many tries, most of them being on his second phase.
His 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7th place on the last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead of 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Because I have less than 3000 points.
(I need 55 Magaki frags and I get 50 - just feel my suffering)
Also in another event with gamer764 I have around 8000 points and got 4th place and got rewards for 4th place, not for 1st.
What is it with needing 7k points or more?
Are the developers too greedy?
I hope the title makes sense.
I have a list of names “john.baker” (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 columns “john” and “baker”.
Thanks!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were going to see each other, and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday, and so I canceled it, and now she won’t stop saying sorry that’s not what she meant.
What the fuck do I do?
I told her I was going on another one next month (lie) to make her feel better, but I didn’t.
But I don’t necessarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks!
Okay, so I’ve got less than a chapter left in Gardens of the Moon and I still can’t understand what the fuck Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I’m missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots.
You all are whack.
What the fuck!
I posted a literal anime foot and still didn’t even make most controversial post of the day, let alone of all time.
So huh, you can’t alpha Karthus ult? What the fuck is this bullshit?
It would be very helpful if all of you original posters out there actually said what the fuck it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it! Such as “now I understand why this [brand name] thing has everyone going crazy”…
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn’t mean much to me.
If it’s too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever at the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the “DFW teams are cursed” camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me too much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential what the fuck transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a PC, but in the meantime I’m using a crappy 13-year-old PC.
I got money for Rust, bought it and it took 4 hours to download, 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server.
After I hit a tree with my rock, my game crashed.
At this time it was 12:47 am and I just said fuck it and went to bed ready for a whole lot of shit today.
EM opens the door: May I help you?
Me:
Yes!
Why did you give your kid permission to enter my house without my permission?
EM:
GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.
GT pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
My girlfriend’s face just turned red, because the treasure he found was her dildo.
My girlfriend snatches that out of GT’s hand.
GF:
This isn’t meant for kids.
GT:
But it’s mine - I found it and finders keepers.
EM: Give him back his treasure.
Me:
Why the fuck are you not watching your son, EM, because he has embarrassed my girlfriend and entered my home without permission.
I have to break up the format “xxx.yyy” into two separate columns “xxx” and “yyy”.
Stop!
Me:
Yes, ma’am.
EM:
What are you listening to?
Me: Better Off Dead from Josh A.
EM: What?!
EK: mom, stop!
Me: Bett-
EM:
I heard you.
What is that cover?
*points to album cover*
Me:
Oh, I think that’s a reference to cu-
EM: *cuts me off again* to satanic ritual.
Me: No, not at all.
EK: Mom, please stop!
EM:
No, EK, this is a bad man.
EM (to me): Now give me your phone.
It was at this moment I knew this was a entitled parent.
Me:
No.
EM:
But my EK needs it.
He’s got his degree.
EK: Mom, I’m 10.
Me:
*coughs* Damn!
EM:
How dare you swear in front of my son?
Yes, she said that damn was a cuss.
Me:
Damn is not a cuss word.
She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot and cold.
Now she’s on to another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state.
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago, we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind of disrespectful to the new boyfriend, huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd.
However, I will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her, but I can’t think of a reason why I should…
After going “uh no?”, she sends me a picture of said candle holder from her kitchen.
I of course go “what the fuck, you’re home?”, and it turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So I’m beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
TLDR: sickly narcisstic mom went into hospital for 3 days.
I find out she’s home because of a candle holder.
It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is that I let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message I sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful because of a song I made that I was sharing.
I was very flirtatious, maybe more so than I was with my girlfriend when I was first talking to her, and that has been echoing in my girlfriend’s mind.
It’s been extremely difficult for her.
We have two dogs now.
I was hoping us having two puppies to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again, because we have them to bond over, but she still can’t say “I love you too”.
She doesn’t accept when I try to give her compliments, because I’ve said rude things in the past when I used to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games, but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you, but I don’t see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trimming my nails, wearing Versace Crystal Noir and other fragrances etc., which I believe is the reason why most girls, even if they’re taken, at least are willing to have a conversation with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self-development, and even though I’ve been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, I never let it get me down and I’m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women, even though I may not have Hollywood good looks or charisma like Will Smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and I wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :-)
She’s 18 inches long and weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
I’m just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champion every 4-5 days and she’s already longer than some males get, so I’m curious!
The anime is about a main character that’s in a game, but she doesn’t realise it, but the system says she’s dead and etc.
I would like to watch the rest of it, so please help me.
Looking for an anime.
I don’t know if to others it’s strange, but to me it was.
I got Covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so I had to tell my mum.
I could’ve just lied and said it was because of sharing cups or kissing a girl, since I’m bi-sexual, but I knew my parents would be accepting...
So I told them as it was.
My mum was very disappointed, because she thought she knew me well, and though I told her everything, but now she couldn’t trust me anymore, because blah blah blah…
Basically, he was very disappointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that I didn’t feel like telling her, because it’s private to me... until today.
She doesn’t really trust me like before, but she’s ok, lol.
Today it’s my birthday, so I’m sharing my “strange” coming out story.
I am confused. What’s going on, lol?
This is my first time with SFU e-mail.
After the semester I haven’t touched anything school-related until today heh, so I don’t know how to fix this.
So me and my friend started playing Valorant again and want us to learn communications such as heaven and all of that.
Now I know what heaven is, but I don’t know others, and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If you’re still confused, I’ll give a scenario: “I hit the Jett, she’s in heaven”, like the location.
She’s an awesome cook, does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but she’s not a good cook either, lol.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well.
She can’t be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or it’s a guy)
She’s all nice and sweet to everyone else, but she’s just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong (not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it., which is wrong.
When she is there, she doesn’t do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren’t there.
The worst part about it is that people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The “false advertising” on the A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill, where it says multiple buffs can’t co-exist.
Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this is all dumb and also kills a lot of people’s excitement.
I don’t like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star, lol.
It’s just like Zhongli.
He was fine, but everyone freaked, because he wasn’t doing enough to dumpster content and was balanced.
I’ve seen lots of people in the fandom make rude or racist comments about Liberty and it’s disgusting.
Please leave her alone.
And you do realize she’s black?
Stop making fun of the actors’ ethnic features.
It’s honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general.
It’s not even funny.
Honestly, it’s just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And it’s not even just Liberty.
I’ve seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmy’s hair.
(Also moderators, please don’t take this down.
I really want people to see it, and I have done nothing wrong.
I’ve been having some of my posts randomly deleted for no reason)
(As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guacamole.)
She then told me we gave her less meat, when I brought back the same plate without guacamole.
She’s home for the first time!
She’s finally back!
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my puppy in her crate at night, because if I don’t she will poop on the floor.
So there’s already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then I have work, which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my Corgi in my bathroom at this time, because if I don’t, she will reek havoc unsupervised.
Am I the asshole for starting a fight with an old friend (strong swearing)?
Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbelievable loss to let a broken and thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest apologies for bumping straight into a noble that half-marched in his drunken stupor down the sidewalk, straight out of a liquor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the main street makes in a month, I was invited to finish the wasted goods, lest they spoil any further.
“Yes sir!
May the heavens cry before your merciful heart!”
“Now get lost!
This is no place for disease-ridden vermin like you.”
“Of course my lord!”
I ran back down the alley I squirmed my way out of.
Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went.
Further and further out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on Snapchat with my friend.
Me and my friend were arguing as a “joke” and then she said she preferred older guys, and my friend was (M14), and I said I’m a year older than you, and she says “what I mean by older guys, I mean aged 17” and it hurt my heart.
TLDR: My crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and I’m 16 and she’s 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here, but I don’t know if I am the butthole or entitled one this story.
This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.
I sent a direct message to the artist I wanted, but nothing for 2 months.
Like yeah, I understand they are booked for summer tattoos, but at least say “Hey I am booked for the rest of ____”.
But I was like “ok, well I am going to look at another artist’s work from this shop that does small tattoos.”
Same thing happens: no answer.
So me and my brother decide “ok, let’s go to the shop and ask, then we will at least get a answer”.
We go, and this young girl attends to us.
Let’s call her Brenda.
I told her everything.
Brenda said “well you can do the tattoo with me”.
I said “I’ll be back.
I’ll think about it”.
I got back in the car and scrolled through her work.
It was good work, so I went back and told her “yeah let’s do this”.
I signed everything.
She didn’t even ask for ID, which I found weird, because I had gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on.
I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.
She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.
I was like “ok, great, thanks!”
4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.
The right side of the heart was smaller then the other side, and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again.
So I reset it, and yeah oops, I was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn’t dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry, and like through text she kind of sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if she’s mad, and like she said she’s only a bit let down.
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me, and like I apologized to her and she said its alright.
Then I just told her I’m going to sleep, and she just left my message on delivered and, like, she didn’t reply until today.
How to tell whether she’s mad at me or just annoyed, because right now I’m really confused?
Would I be the asshole if I was just a bigger sarcastic asshole to another asshole?
Her tumors are beginning to open through her skin, she won’t jump, painkillers don’t help, she ate a lot yesterday but won’t eat or drink today, she hid most the day, but... it’s hard, because she’s alert.
It feels wrong, because she looks at me like “I love you.
I’m happy you’re here with me.”
But the vet said she wasn’t even supposed to live this long, and the tumors will only get worse, and even if we had done chemotherapy, it would have only prolonged it.
My friend told my girlfriend something.
She then broke up with me.
I don’t know what to do now, because she and the ex-friend were the only people that I had.
What should I do to try and regain my relationship, because she’s helped me through a lot over our 2 years of dating?
TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me because of something someone said, and I want to regain my relationship with my girlfriend.
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee, because she’s a person of color with tattoos and “fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up, because I need to protect my staff, but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex loves kids.
She was playing Captain Save a Hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman’s situation with this girl’s “crazy” baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in each other’s life.
It hasn’t even been two months!
I’m so hurt.
She never wanted to build a life with me.
I knew she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, as soon as he saw that I was weeping, answered, “Come with me.”
Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.
Entering, he led me with him on the bounds of a great circle itself encircling a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land covered with lava pyramids, with sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life save for those imprisoned in it, who, though they surrounded us, dared not approach for fear of the master.
As my ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, cries, and explosions that made the eternal air tremble, caused by slaughter, starvation, withering, and frief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, of men, women, and children.
They’ve grown out to the point they look kind of awkward, and she’s saying I should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something I’d like better?
Aah!
She said she might have some clothes that fit me.
I’m dying!
She’s so supportive and nice, oh my God!
So, it’s 0:34 the first of January while posting this, and my sister (F14) just ruined my New Year by calling my mum fat and telling her she’s a drinker when she poured herself a glass of champagne, which she only does on her birthday on Christmas Eve and on New year.
Now my parents are pissed off, my grandparents are pissed off, and my sister thinks she was funny.
The same thing happened on Christmas Eve, and now the whole feeling of New Year is gone and I hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sorry for my spelling.
Screw INTJ’s. Why have they got to be good at everything?
It was a mistake getting the booster the day before New Year’s.
I feel like absolute dog water.
Literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and I almost cried 🙏 I’m so happy, bro.
She’s so cool.
I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :-)
Also, happy New Year’s Eve and happy New Year everyone!
First of all, the satisfaction I get from saying I am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
A high I’ll never come off of.
Second of all, a customer comes in for the second time, mad because I didn’t do copies from a book because of copyright.
She goes “well, I called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
And I’m like ??, ma’am it’s in our policy.
I don’t care what customer service says.
She keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy”.
Like, lol, not when you act rude like that.
Our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and she’s such a cuddly, loving, little girl and I love her cuddles every night and in the morning.
I’m just scared that she isn’t going to be like that after she gets fixed.
Am I overthinking it?
Do you think since she’s in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she’ll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I don’t fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently she’s been asking me if I’ll fart in front of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and it’s weird she’s never heard me do it.
I can’t believe she saying I’m depressed looking while she’s such a shy girl and weird thinking she’s not.
So delusional.
I hate it, but they are my only friends.
She’s calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to D2 after several year, now I’m wondering: Where do you guys sell or buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or is there a website that’s more efficient?
My friends are mean and delusional.
One is immature and shy and always pulling me down.
The other is fine, just jealous, and it’s getting on my nerves.
What to do?
This is a setup I can live with.
My boyfriend’s and my fear however is that in a few years when we’re ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own boyfriend.
I’m very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow any more pushing of the boundaries.
What do I do here?
Boundary Issues with my boyfriend’s alter.
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was up-front when we met and said she’s shit at texting, and has apologised when we were speaking for slow replies, something to which I said “don’t worry, I know you’re busy!”
The conversation seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation.
However, I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread), but she’s viewed my story and posted a story since.
It was New Year’s Eve.
So I was all ready for the New Year actually thinking positive and the changes I’m going to make, etc.
Then I see he’s posted a picture of them both that she’s taken saying “love of my life”.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face!
Ex’s boyfriend posted a picture of them :-(
Every time I ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even though she’s older, what the fuck?) and that I shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her.
She drains the life out of me.
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently I’ve been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, I could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brought herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to separate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later, we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great.
I’m so happy.
In our anniversary month, what do I see on his phone Snapchat?
I look at it again, I see Jane, but this time I can look at their conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So I just got my first bearded dragon.
He’s only a month old, and like most new owners, I’m worried about if he or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day, but so far I’ve only been able to feed him about 6-7 crickets.
I’ve tried feeding him some vegetables too, but the guy doesn’t show any interest in them.
Is there anything I’m doing wrong or is he just fine and I’m overly worried?
Then I found out about this really cool website called Complex.
They’re sort of like journalism but better, since they’re all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through Complex.
Before, I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic, but Travis Scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
Now I like Tame Impala, and I’ve started dressing weirder, I bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully I’ll wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromises himself/herself on social media?
Is it just me cringing at the Twitter posts by Albatross?
Everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
He’s making it seem like XVG is a sinking ship at the moment, and it’s doing fine.
So I have this friend in real life.
Man, the dude is known everywhere.
He’s got a solid reputation on the streets, in the jails.
Everywhere this guy goes, everyone knows him.
He was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on Reddit, because I feel like I’m not really known.
How do you get hella karma?
I’m 21, he’s about to be 23.
My issue is that he seems to have no ambition anymore.
He doesn’t work and doesn’t make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an EMT.
He failed it the first time by 2 points, and I think he fears failure so he doesn’t really want to try anything anymore.
He’s been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
I’ve gotten Super Smough about 5 times, but I always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear I’m far enough away, but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
I’m using a 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helms and naked (even with tattered armor it doesn’t seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know by throwing myself at them enough times I’ll get them, but it’s slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do, but I seem to always get caught in a dumb combination or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or notice the letter I put in there, and now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you you read this sentence wrong too?
Well, now that I have your attention!
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :-)
19/F Aw shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time.
If I just want to make Draven my 1 carry, how should I do it?
I know he’s a good unit, but what items can turn him into a god?
I tried healing sword and rapid fire cannon, but I get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character.
However, his shield’s gun is overpowered and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets that’s fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate, because it got absorbed.
I don’t know about other players’ opinions, but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so he’s not overpowered enough to counter everything.
Tell me what you people think.
I didn’t think anything of it, so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him, the entitled kid started screaming “Mommy, he stole my cookies!”
At first I was startled.
I started to get nervous, and I froze.
Then entitled parent walks up and starts yelling “Give those cookies back to my daughter!
Give them back!”
And I did not know what to say at first, but then something came to mind: just say “but I didn’t.”
But the way I said it was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That’s when my dad noticed (he’s old — sad he didn’t realise a little bit earlier) He called a manager to the scene, and the manager told us to continue and he’ll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We’re both xxx majors (I’m a dual xxx and yyy major while she’s a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn’t say I’m smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I’m a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (she will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
It’s not until my next billing cycle that I noticed something was off.
I was a bit lower than normal and I keep a very close eye on my expenses.
I looked over my bank statements and there it was: My new Prime bill.
I was super confused and got hold of Amazon’s customer support.
They helped me as much as they could, but because I was receiving my service through the phone company, I would have to go though them and figure out the problem.
The next day that I had off, I walked in and talked to a very sweet girl, who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kind of talked in circles for a bit as I tried to explain what the Amazon customer service told me.
We looked me up in their system and there I was: 2 lines, but no Prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date I opened my first line and then the second.
Both dates added up to what I had told her before.
She stared at the computer screen for a while with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tomorrow I’m no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach out all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered, it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance, and he messaged me on Friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said I didn’t change anything.
After that part of the conversation ended, I asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
He said that he’s good when he doesn’t think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him, etc.
Day 1 of no contact starts tomorrow.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster.
We used my name and I’ll credit his Instagram below.
He’s a good guy.
I’m glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and our story.
Would you guys like either homemade lore or not?
I couldn’t post this on the Fallout Reddit for some reason.
It wouldn’t let me put the photo.
I hope it’s good, guys!
Is it even possible for ITSOKTOCRY to blow up outside of the 3 songs he’s had do extremely well? Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for a while, and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much I despise griefers, because they don’t just destroy something in a game, they destroy hours of work, and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying I’m mean if I don’t go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non-stop how I’m “mean” or a “bad person”, because I’m busy doing something so I can’t go give him his shit.
Well, I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I don’t see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy.
We do get slightly tipsy, you know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a Facebook message saying he’s ready for her to leave (she’d been there 2 hours at this point) and then he starts passive-aggressive cleaning in front of us.
He’s going through a divorce so he keeps telling me that’s taking all his money.
I didn’t give him a title as I didn’t even get one when I bought it.
It was salvaged from some guys at a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale, but I’ve long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do you think it’s not worth it?
Also, if I did want to how, would I?
So I just told this guy in my class, who was also weird as fuck and gave it to him saying “oof, I sat on it.
It broke.
Do you just want it?”
He’s like “no, ew”.
I have OCD and immediately got ashamed and was like “lol, why’s it gross?
It’s the same as a whole one (and along that line), like, lol, why?”, and he was like “ok, oof, it’s not” and I’m like “lol, why did you say that?”
I was saying it jokingly, but I’m afraid I looked weird.
Like what the fuck?
Why’s she upset or playfully upset that I don’t want it.
My human staff comes home tasting of sausages and cheese.
I think she has another fluff she is making treats for.
Should I be sad or angry?
What does your human taste of when they come home?
I can tell where your human has been and what they do by taste when they come back?
Anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday I finally mustered up the courage to message him.
Me: Hey, how’s everything?
Him: It’s been a long time.
Me: Sorry about last year.
I was super awkward around you, lol.
Him: lol, no, don’t worry about it.
*drum roll please*
Me: To be honest, I liked you blah blah blah…
Him: Haha, you could’ve just told me!
Next time you see me just say hi.
Do you still go to <school>?
I’m not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn’t sit well with me.
Hey guys, I just wanted to share this helpful application with you all :-D.
It’s not that I am trying to promote this application or something.
It really helped me a lot.
That’s why I thought it might even help you guys out.
I’ve seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team OVRs, and many are thinking to buy players, but can’t decide which will boost their team OVRs the most.
This application helps to calculate the OVR of your team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people (F2P players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team OVR since it will result in a huge loss of coins (because of 10% EA tax).
What’s the recommended amount of dedicated RAM I should have to server?
If you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.
You should be asleep.
Go to bed, I say.
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Star Butterfly.
She had blond hair, blue eyes and a super cute and colorful dress.
And she had a magic wand!
One day she got kicked out of Mewny (her home dimension) by her mean mom >:-( just because she made a mistake.
So she had to go to Earth.
On Earth, there was a boy named Marco Diaz.
He liked safety and he was super handsome.
Everybody at school was in love with him!
(Except for that idiot Jackie)
So anyway, Star came to the principal’s office.
He was like “Star, this is Marco.
He’s your guide.”
Star looked at Marco and she was shocked.
“Wow, you’re so hot.”
“lol, thank you” he said, blushing, and he winked.
“Let me show you around the school.”
“Ok”, said Star.
So they walked around school and they became friends.
“Ok, since you’re my best friend now, I should probably tell you who I am”, said Star.
“I’m a magic princess”.
Then she took out her wand and created 667 laser puppies!
I have a question for this Reddit.
Can you provide honest answers?
I currently have a custom build PC with i7 3770k 32g@1666 RAM and single GTX 1080 GPU.
Should I get a second one for 650 euros or wait for what upcoming years will bring?
GTX 1080 SLI or save money for 11th generation Nvidia xx80 TI GPU?
I know a lot about Jailbreak.
Should I make a Jailbreak?
How many likes can a thoughtless post get as long as I like Telecaster? :l.
If you don’t upvote post you hate Telecasters and should die.
Thanks, ok.
I love Telecasters.
We should rename August to October, because he wasn’t released in August.
I’m out, boys :-)
I bought GTA4 for Steam PC and it won’t work.
It worked fine for a small year on Windows 7, and now my PC has Windows 10 and it won’t work.
I made Social Club and Games for Windows Live accounts, but it won’t work even with accounts.
It won’t work even for single player.
It won’t work after the people on screen wait in the loading screen.
Then suddenly when the game should start, it just closes the window and that’s it.
So how make it work ?
How do we get them to know they should use it?
The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse...
I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty.
I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens.
I want to own freedom...
How do we change the landscape?
What are your thoughts?
Sorry for my English being bad.
I should buy up that limited time bike for Halloween before it disappears next week.
Inside your body, deep beneath your skin, muscles, and not beneath your organs, lurks 1 (one) skeleton.
Spooky!
But wait, it gets worse.
The skeleton inside you doesn’t even pay rent!
He/she lives in your body so he/she should pay rent!
They freeload off you and don’t even do shit for you.
So you should evict your spooky boy.
Happy Halloween!
Edit: I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it has!
Thanks for the 6 upvotes!
Just small information, I’m 5’9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k, but I really can’t hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical “you should be good, but you’re not, so I’m going to give you unrealistic goals”, or should I be at 1:49?
My head hurts when I go krumping heads with other boys!
Green lighting things go all over the place too!
What should I do, doctors?!
Right, so I’ve fixed my headaches!
I’ve had to throw up some burny green stuff!
The boss says I should do that more on the battle, the place we’ve been fighting in!
I’ve got a metal stick for my trouble too!
This poem went as follows: > My name is frog, > I like to play, > Out in the rain, > All night and day.
> My skin is green, > My face is coy, > You look and say, > Here comes that boy.
This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Aren’t you all tired of seeing at least the first two jumping into battle and wiping out your whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying that if they weren’t here then, well, the game would be balanced.
Well, I beg to differ, because there’s Akai with his insane disruption and Diggie with his timely ult or maybe even Irithel might be banned because of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly, the king and queen of this game are Lancelot and his beloved Fanny.
You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is.
She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo.
You be a good girl!”
She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak.
Haha!
Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what?
Haha!
She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl!
You left the steak alone!”
And that is the story of me being a good girl.
Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt.
She says she is dumb not to think of that.
Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers.
Now I obviously can’t get out and shut it on the main road, so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I’ve quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothing’s happened.
My bed smells like disease.
I should probably wash it.
Please send me some tips and stuff on what to teach him.
Currently he’s doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns, because that’s the only gun he gets kills from.
I already taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
By the way, this is coming from an Iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say I should be silver and some even say platinum, because I carried a gold player).
Do you know how some motherfuckers exist?
They literally get close to you, then all of a sudden you have problems, and even though you apologize again and again and again, no it’s never enough for them.
I was in a Google Meet, but I told them I’d be back in 10.
I forgot my phone so I went to get it, and guess what, them speaking about you and backstabbing you.
You seriously don’t know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
Maybe I am overthinking, but I’d rather die alone than live among these kind of people.
Maybe I should just ignore them?
Or should I give them another chance?
Or maybe I am just weird, lol.
l have developed feelings for my best friend.
Now, the question is: should l tell her how l feel about her?
Will this affect our relationship that we have?
How will she take it?
I’ve been waiting for two years now, savings from then and I barely made 200 USD until now.
I’m still studying, and gaming is my dream… and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness from life… to be honest…
What should I get?
A monitor or a GPU…?
Some of you are so lucky to get a GPU for free on here… lol…
Am I the asshole?
Me (31F) asked my kids dad (43M) to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in the kids’ room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not meant to lift too much or stretch but felt OK and thought I could do it alone.
I can’t.
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of the walls where I can’t reach.
He said yes and today came to do it.
After a bit, he said he was done and leaving.
I gave him £20 and said how grateful I am for the help.
I checked the room once he left...
Both kids’ beds were full of torn off wallpaper, drawers cracked where he stood on them.
I’ve still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent the last 45 minutes picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds.
Am I the asshole if I confront him about the mess or should I let it go and not bother asking in future?
My boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when I ask dumb questions (for example, I didn’t know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard?
Just fill it”.
So I tried to do it but I failed.
Later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?”
Then when I do it myself and don’t ask him he goes “why don’t you ask me?
I can teach you or help you”, but I refrain from asking, because he gets frustrated.
The last couple of calls had arguments, as he got mad, because I beat his ass in video games (even though gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked about him to lots of my real life friends, and they all ask why I continue to be his friend, and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only people who actively tries to interact with him online.
Yeah I know, my shoes don’t match.
They match the graffiti though!
I’m trying a lot of different styles, so let me know what I should change.
Hat: Sicko by Ian Conner
Shoes: Nike Everything else is thrifted.
Ok, so I swallowed a small piece of box (?) tape as I was trying to bite it off with my teeth, and then I feel it in my ear 😭 not ear but that hole in my throat that leads to the ear.
It’s just stuck there, oh my God 😭😭😭 What should I do, lol?
I don’t remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida, there’s a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100 times longer than when it’s not making a sound.
I’d describe it as that trademark desert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff, and … it’s just dude what…?
Heck, it’s weird.
So maybe it’s both a sort of a paradox (life is), but I just want to know, honestly, did anyone else feel it?
I want a logical explanation please, and if one doesn’t exist, well I mean, because long before…
I was “of age” so to speak… for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate, because I don’t drink, but I’ve…hmm…
I’m an adult, let’s put it like that.
There’s other stuff out there, but long before that, me and my family saw a UFO.
Even my stepdad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been, and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall and, like… it doesn’t really scare me, because I think it’s the way life is.
Things change.
They don’t always have to make sense, and others say that too.
Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling: > The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.
And so the North Wind was obliged to confer that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm autumn moon.
Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you yet again, creating chaos.
Who would win?
Please give a detailed explanation.
Ares (Greek mythology) vs. Mars (Roman mythology) vs. Svetovid (Slavic mythology) vs. Odin (Norse mythology) vs. The Big Bang (Atheistic mythology).
I am very ready.
I am very good.
I would like to apply for village idiot.
Should I get Horizon Zero Dawn or ELEX, because they are the same price right now, so what should I buy?
I’m just looking for reason.
By the way, I like open world a lot and shooters, e.g. Skyrim, Battlefield, COD, Ark Survival Evolved.
So any ideas on what I should be?
By the way, I would prefer them really quick.
Thanks in advance.
Thanks for the suggestions guys.
We are going to try to get the AK-477, because someone said it would help, but where do we find it?!
Please help with it.
We can’t do it alone :-)
I reside in Hyderabad, India, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in computer science.
I am a Canadian citizen, but for enrolment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam.
Now, the doubt that has arisen is… would my admission be considered international or domestic?
On a side note, how hard is it to be admitted to UoT’s computer science program?
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
I would prefer a hardcore clan with a plan.
With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal or target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It’s not a necessity, but it would be nice.
PM me if you’re interested!
By the way, it’s my first post on this subreddit, so I might not have gotten it all down correct.
Locusts, grasshoppers, etc. can shut the hell up.
I’ve literally heard people tell me they learnt then forgot the entire Japanese language through anime.
I live in a house with a single mother whose first language is Thai and I barely heard English until I was like 4.
She would speak in Thai to me yet I don’t know any Thai.
You can’t learn Japanese though anime.
In fact I watched anime in Thai dubbed as a child.
I don’t fucking know shit.
Fools thinking they are out here saying “konnichiwa” in style, I’m contacting the authorities.
Here’s a question for you.
So you know the Panzer, Blue Gitz, the Tau or whatever?
So I, being a Mek, notice that they’ve got tanks and stuff that are flying, right, but they’ve not go the flames coming from whatever thrusters keep them in the air.
And they don’t make the beautiful roar that thrusters make.
I figure some commando would want a flying truck that doesn’t make a noise.
It’s a good market strategy.
Anyway, the question: “how do I krump gravity without a sound?”
Construction: teleport to house, for when they work on making player-owned houses useful, this would be godly to have.
Heck!
Even now, player-owned houses has a permanent dummy for adrenaline building, prayer altar, and if they make it like Old School RuneScape, where you can teleport outside any player-owned house portal, this cape would be used a lot.
Hitpoints: Heal from regeneration ability increased, current perk I doubt would be used at either bossing or slayer.
This one is used at slayer at least.
I got one of my annual minds.com token ads in my mail today (I of course unsubscribed as soon as I found the option) and thought “hey, what the heck, let’s make a visit on the supposedly “alternative Facebook” that I just recently got denied for having a “non-believable name” and waiting further ID specification before I can use it again.”
And so I did and found out on the 2nd or 3rd post that The AJ Show has been blocked on YouTube, I’m not a fan of rightwing stuff and was actually the reason I stopped watching it 2 years ago, though the small fragrance of freedom was that hard to find among the 90% national-capitalism the site has to offer, but anyhow, I got the idea of a non-censoring video site like LiveLeak but much more simple and less “newsy” that anyone can post on.
No content would be removed ❤️
Hi guys.
I’m at 1500 hours right now, and my instructor still doesn’t let me solo.
I think I’m doing my manoeuvres ok, but the instructor says I still need more practice.
I’ve tried my manoeuvres on a flight simulator, and my friend captain says that I should stop sending him videos of me playing GTA on my computer at 1 in the morning, although I trained hard on my flight manoeuvres.
What should I do?
I’m literally crying and shaking right now.
My friend would never do that :-(
Why don’t they make like Sesame Street for the kids, yo?
Like, it is very educational, I think kids would learn a lot from it.
I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras.
I have some questions and hope someone can help answer.
1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc.
Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about?
2. Is there enough parking for the second car?
3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to?
4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ?
It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place...
I appreciate any advice I get.
Bones says something like “switchblade on my waist don’t test”, and it was old young teenage bones, and the beat was hella mellow.
I would really appreciate this.
Finally it’s giving me an internet connection, but the only problem is, it’s so slow.
It’s capable of loading like Google, but anything else just times out.
And for some reason I can’t access my router admin page.
Really weird.
It’s just a white screen or it times out loading it, or the page becomes unresponsive!
Help would be appreciated, thank you!
Hey all, so today I was in the group chat with friends, and like four of them were roasting the fuck out of me, and at first it was funny, then my ego and self-respect got crippled after building it up for a couple days.
Haha, fun.
Yes, I know I am lonely and won’t get a girlfriend, but you don’t need to be jerk like that, haha.
I’ve searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
They could even go woah eee ahh ahh/oh eee ahh.
The possibilities are endless and I know it’s hard.
I’m just wondering if anyone knows it, thanks!
Hi there, it’s good to see you again!
*sits down*
How have you been?
*cuts a potato with my sacrificial dagger*
Wow, that’s great to hear.
*adds 12kg of salt*
Hm, there we go.
*throws a handful over my left shoulder for the devil*
Ok good, let’s eat.
*removes a small flask from my jacket and pours blood from it onto my plate in a small thick puddle*
Haha, that’s the good stuff right there.
*chomp chomp
*
Do you want some?
No?
Ok good *eats a spoonful of salt*
Oh!
This is crunchy.
*chews and spits out bones*
Huh *licks lips*
Welp, that was wonderful, I’m pooped.
*gets up*
Thanks for having me over!
*transforms into a bat and flies away*
I’m feeling sad, but it’s okay I guess.
Because medicines will help help us all.
Thank you, have a good morning and good night and good evening Truman show, haha.
Just kidding.
It’s going to be just as shitty if not worse than last year.
All these skin mods and such, how’s it being done?
I’d like to try it.
Is it player-side only?
Mods?
How are people modding Battlefront 2 or is it Photoshop?
Hi, I was wondering whether or not it is worth dropping some money on pets.
Like, I saw how much some people can spend on them to get good results (like T4), and I wouldn’t want to spend that much :-D.
Currently, I have 5 T1 pets, and I wouldn’t mind seeing some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping “just” $100 would be worth it.
Is it worth dropping $100 on pets?
Towards the end of senior year and that summer, I don’t know what happened, but I got a hot body and my face was all “girl, you’ve been through some shit.
Have a gift”, so now I’m pretty.
I just made a post on a different subreddit about having a nice date today, which is nice, but I am very hesitant on making friends and stuff because of the last two years.
So like, after my glow up or whatever, more people started talking to me, yeah.
And a lot of boys did too!
I never really had very many friends, so this was a huge yay!
The first boy I hung out with was really nice, but then we got high and I did very regrettable things I do not like.
Well, that boy was super happy and told lots of boys.
I don’t want to jinx it and call them out by name, but I’m talking with a company and I’m hoping it works out!
I’m excited about all things I’ll be able to do with these free promo products to help other people and possibly get them off some or all of their Rx drugs!
I’m excited for myself, because I have a bunch of medical issues that I do not use Rx drugs for and the other stuff I buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others, and it will help this company as well.
I’m ready, I’m ready!
I’m hella excited! I might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do: my plant’s now way too small for its age in my opinion and has started to grow pistils.
Should I chop and restart or…?
I will be posting more here once I get… comfortable again.
(Self-love is important!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through - will get to them when I can :-)
In the meantime, Happy New Year!
P.S. I don’t have a Snapchat and don’t take any money, I just like to show off, you know, closet slut things :-)
lol
Talk to you later, everyone!
He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.
I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No.
You’re fucked up now.
What’s going on?”
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says “good lord, what the fuck happened?
I’ve got to garden.
Talk to you later”.
He read my reply, which said “I’m so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it, and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated”.
I just don’t know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him, and he will always be my first, and I’ll always talk to him and care for him, but I don’t want to be held in limbo.
I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know whenever I say “talk to you later” or “good night” or whatever I want to add an “I love you”.
Just casually.
To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day, just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten-fold.
I know sometimes I daydream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
It makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
To be honest, I kind of hope it is, because I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof, is it hitting me hard!
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I (I will takes days or a week to respond), but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to at the moment.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick “talk to you later” either to be honest.
Finally they seem to want to engage with me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then on the day.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on, and it’s not like we’re really talking, so I just block them.
I don’t know, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival.
I’m still “Ocean Serene”, but maybe I’m...
I don’t know, that’s a tough thing to say, I never thought that my girlfriend was just a random.
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said a lot of things, I’m gonna agree that if I change, the world changes.
The advice you get, it’s always iffy.
I want to speak for everyone, but at the same time I can only speak for myself.
Also, I went to get some rum and coke.
I got coke and a few other people saw it, so they bought some coke…
erm, I hope my friends are ok (that’s all you weirdos I’m talking about).
Random story I know.
To be honest, I’m not ok, but I’m surviving like usual.
Actually I’m all just a bit right and fine.
Talk to you later.
Talk to you later.
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, it’s 8 hours to [redacted], 7 to [redacted].
Not a big deal.
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles, an hour’s drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol [me] I suppose [redacted] or [redacted]’s wife ratted me out.
Maybe I should block them too.
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house, and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you, and we can see how well that went.
[me] Shit.
Betrayal.
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self-gratification.
I was in a toxic relationship for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our relationship, we were great.
One day, both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
I’m going to admit that sometimes when I feel jealous, I just want her to reassure me like how I reassure her that it’s all good, but she will only reassure me once and then said “bye” or “talk to you later”.
Most of the time in an argument, it’s always my fault.
She won’t admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight won’t continue anymore.
And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”
And he said “Yeah, well I’ve got to go.
I’m doing something”, and I was going to type “alright, talk to you later”, but I realized we aren’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe.
When the conversation started.
But once he said he’s doing something, my heart dropped.
Like, what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him, but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doens’t like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now, I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he wants to do that.
If he doesn’t want to talk to me, he can just fucking tell me.
I don’t know what else to put besides that I hate the current circumstance of life I live in.
I’m going to give a little insight tomorrow.
Ok, I lied.
I have to reveal my age tomorrow, because if I don’t, it’ll mess up the story.
Um, I don’t know what to type so I’ll type a worry I have.
Um, I don’t think I’ll get the tape gun in time.
Ok bye, talk to you later everyone.
She said something like “but I want to make sure that we go as a friend?” thing and I was like “okay, I know”, and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said “of course I like my long time boyfriend”.
Yeah, whatever, right, haha.
And here’s my question...
Yesterday when I was at work, she messaged me saying something like “how’s your work doing?”, and I kind of replied to her with a cold tone saying “I’m at work, talk to you later”, and
then she, kind of upset: “Okay, I mean I understand you are at work so busy, but you didn’t cut me off like this before; so I kind of get it that you don’t want to talk anymore like before.
Got it!
Bye!”
How do you get destiny delicacies?
I’ve seen a few people have them, but I’ve never got one.
I don’t know where you get them.
If anyone knows, it would be a lot of help :-)
And my machine fucking freezes up.
It’s been happening for like 2 days now...
This machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3D scanner, but 4 browser tabs on Reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% of my damn memory and 60% of my CPU power and freezes the whole damn thing up.
Hey!
Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint!
Seriously, what the fuck are you developers doing?
Stop, please!
If you think it’s rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying “got to go, I’ll talk to you later”, then it’s also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one-off.
Things happen.
Maybe something came up and you got distracted, etc.
But every single person ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It’s really not that hard to just say “got to go, I’ll text you later” or “so-and-so just got home, talk to you later”.
Even just “bye” or “be right back” or something!
Today I got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if I did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn’t want to ignore them just to talk to me.
I said it wouldn’t be a problem if he had just said something like “I can’t talk right now” or “I’m with my friends, talk to you later” or just literally anything.
He then said I was overthinking stuff and I should “chill out”, so I left it at that.
So am I the asshole and overthinking things
?
Am I the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend after he ignored me for a few days?
So I would usually post this on r/keto, but that subreddit is so intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But, like, a girl’s got to rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
I have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere, I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, calories please”.
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their “no cheat days” mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten-free dairy-free carbohydrate dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
As far I as I know, the concept of mini-album is only around in K-pop (maybe I-pop?).
I’m always disappointed when a long-awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5-song album.
I can tolerate a debut album, since you really don’t have a lot of material, but if you’re SNSD or something and you come out with mini after a years long hiatus like Mr.Mr, it’s kind of insulting.
I don’t know what to say, lol.
I’m pretty funny, not only because I manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often, but also because I’m just fucking hilarious to be honest.
I’m from Yorkshire, and that probably makes me cooler than you, because the North is just superior, and I’m ready to die on this hill, but I guess we can be mates.
I would really like some of those.
Ok, I’m running out of people to laugh at my jokes.
17M from the UK, Please be able to hold a conversation, lol.
I don’t know what kind of dog this was, but it was so ugly.
My god, who would own such a thing?
Dogs with wrinkles like Pugs, Shar Peis (I don’t know how to spell it), Bulldogs, Boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all; I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally been told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness and over the nose, they can’t breathe)
And yes, I know I’m going to get shit on by all the fucking neckbeards on Reddit that just adore their snot nose little Pug.
I don’t even care.
I’m so tired of people and their dogs.
Every time I listen to him, shit makes so much sense, even though I don’t know what he is talking about.
That leads me to believe that either that guy is a genius who can articulate what’s going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something.
I mean what should I listen to if I really want to find out the truth, if Schiff is just “biased toward gold”, and that’s the reason why he is so hard on the current economy, etc.
Are boobs nice?
Because, I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before.
Then he checks the oil level, saying that the oil also smells like gasoline, that gasoline and oil are mixing up together.
He opens one spark plug, sees the massive leak in there literally full up.
Let me say, oil smells like gasoline.
I didn’t smell that one.
That’s what the worker told me.
Then he call his boss, and the boss says it is not gasoline, it is just oil, “that shit smells like gasoline” 🤦🏾‍♂️ Even the worker confirmed that I’m not crazy, but ay, maybe I am.
And his worker told me he was going to seal the black thing that goes on top of the spark plug that covers it.
Sorry, my English is not that amazing.
He said he was putting a seal after draining the oil as he mentioned.
As oil drained, the oil sealed the thing so oil doesn’t drip out of it and doesn’t drip to the floor.
But it didn’t help me find the cause of why oil is getting into the spark plug, because a seal on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️ He tells me if the problem keeps on, it is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way too much oil and is causing the oil leak, that if the problems persist I will have to remove it.
Sorry for the long paragraph, but I need advice.
I need help to be honest.
My rabbit didn’t eat or drink, so I went to check him.
It’s been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food, I don’t know.
(He has constipation so I’m going to check if he poops.)
How do I sleep if I have to check on my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is going to become chaotic, lol.
I assume the time has already passed for this, but, I don’t know, I figured I may as well ask.
I kind of forgot I even had those tickets until they announced they’d be touring again today.
Now, my aunts (grandma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated grandma both before and after she passed.
When my grandma first started getting sick, my sister wasn’t the best, because she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but grandma was also scared of Covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job I couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back and forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
Would I be the asshole if I didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So I met this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dating.
Last night, everything was all right, she was happy said “good night” and “I love you” like every night.
And the next morning when I texted her good morning, she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad as fuck all day because of me but didn’t want to say why.
I don’t know what I did.
I did nothing.
What should I do?
How can I contact her?
Should I give her space?
My girlfriend blocked me, and I don’t know why.
Mine’s ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in which I have an F.
This is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I’ve done but are nowhere in the books,
This kind of snuck up on me, because I thought they were done and filed, only to check my grades and find out they weren’t.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you are going to say “I know right, I only have an 89, why couldn’t she round up?
Fuck my life)
I’m going to be honest, that’s not very helpful right now.
So first off, Bard top.
What a pick, I know right?
Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like.
*my core is static/ie/RFC.
Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way.
I like to safely clear and lay out poke.
Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer.
Giving some more tank…
Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain.
I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade.
This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great.
If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy.
I’m tet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years, we’re both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It’s driving me crazy, how to deal with it?
This wouldn’t be an issue if all your servers asked at the beginning “do you guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.”
Also, why restaurants have to be set up like that?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Hey guys, Bard main.
I just joined Reddit after finding out there are other off-meta Bards!
So I main him top.
Yes, it’s scary, but I do.
So I’ve been getting a lot of questions about my builds from friends and happy on-lookers lately!
I thought I’d share my builds!
I’m 16 years old, 5’9.
I’m new to basketball and I’d like to ask for drills I can do by myself so I can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I don’t have a decent shot nor a decent handle, I could barely reach the backboard plus I have no friends so don’t even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why I wanted to be good at it so bad is because I just want people to know me as somebody, because right now I’m a nobody, I want to be somebody.
P.S. I’ve never played an actual basketball ever in my life…
I know, right?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising, you know) but pretty chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when I want to be), goofy, a little chaotic, big overthinker kind of deal.
Enneagram type 4, because apparently that matters (just kidding!).
I’m honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love... you get the gist :-)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist, so a program with medical school prerequisites would be preferable.
Plus, I plan to take my medical school abroad (wow, big dreams much?
I doubt I’d get in, but it wouldn’t hurt to try though).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me.
I’d be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh, and location too.
I’m short, so if my classes are far, I might as well rollerskate my way through campus, just kidding.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, you know...
Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would’ve prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do.
The player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now, but I don’t know if I want to pursue her.
It’s complicated.
Right now its summer break, so I’m going to wait until school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person, because they don’t talk to me online, lol.
I don’t know how long this series will go, but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I don’t know how long this is going to take but probably quite a while.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I don’t have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say that if you’re a kid, like an elementary school kid and you’re here, where the fuck are your parents? lol, never mind, fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Because I got them and no one to give them too, lmao, just kidding, unless...
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium Sprite and a McDouble?
So I don’t know why I got on everyone’s nerves about the separate checks…
Hey, hi!
Haha...
I’m new here, I didn’t know this existed until now.
I am extremely shy and don’t know what I’m doing here typing this, haha.
But hey, first time for everything right?
If we don’t click and you lose interest, then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry, lmao.
I don’t expect to get any messages, but hey, it’s worth a try.
P.S.
I don’t know how to write these properly, so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format, oh my.
Oh and if I don’t reply soon, it might mean I’m asleep or playing DnD, hehe.
Never mind.
My internet is down right now.
Fuck.
Well I’m going to see if I can buy some stuff off Steam now... Let’s hope there are still some good sales.
Okay, so I was a total noob and erased my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was going to use, but I sent Monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
Or how do you open the .key file?
Edit: never mind, I’m a complete noob.
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive Monero wallet seeds with a .keyfile?
user765123: No, I just had the “is now playing” thing show up.
A:
I know.
A:
Well, here we go.
A: “easily disturbed”, lol
A:
Momma, help me.
A:
Help me.
A:
What’s the canon name?
user765123: ?
A: my name.
A:
What’s the canon one?
user765123:
There is none, pick whatever name you want.
A:
Oh.
A:
Am I a girl?
user765123: Male.
A:
Argh.
<talking about their name here> user765123
:
That seems like a good name.
user765123:
lol A: >:-)
user765123:
(not that it really matters.
I just used my real life name)
Comment So I can guess your gender based on your post history.
Never mind… let me guess your gender instead.
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the professor is October 18.
(Edit: never mind, this part isn’t true, please disregard).
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is February 9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the professor that I’m dropping the course?
Do I also have to get permission?
I’m planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits by the way.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I really wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what?!” really loudly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “never mind”, because I felt like I was in the motherfucking spotlight.
But every time, my narcissistic mom says that it can’t be true, because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
“It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?”
Um, I don’t know, maybe it’s because we’re different people with different bodies?
To be honest, has anyone ever experienced fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn’t die and manage to kill a least one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch, but rampage didn’t pop his ult yet.
😲 What the fuck?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky as fuck fighter, and a carry that solos everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also.
I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in...
Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
Like now I feel guilty for smiling.
Never mind the fake ones shit, but fuck.
Haha.
Ugh.
Why am I still alive?
lol, why the fuck does smiling hurt?
Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me.
I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible.
He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever.
I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions.
And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had.
I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting.
But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedely keep eating my food.
I do that for maybe 3 seconds.
Then I look back up.
Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds.
Edit: Yes, I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen.
Useful, I know.
But ugh.
They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
By the way, there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit

:
never mind.
I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance.
Oops, now I’m not getting any MP!
Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!”
The message repeats every time I hit enter.
What the fuck!
I’m not cheating.
Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player.
10/10 I’m never playing again.
Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens.
I’m going to skip the Oscar-bait shit like The Post, because there’s only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Democrats making movies about how (extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) “politics used to be more polite.
We need a return to the discourse.”
I’m sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas, but I’m just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns at the moment, but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior offensive line I think is a major problem, but there is no Nelson-like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there, that’s really the only situation where I absolutely stay put.
2 months ago, I bought a cheap ’95 Nissan truck.
I was only locally driving, so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn’t put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm.
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd only when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can’t rev it past 3k in my driveway without feeling like I’m going to break something, I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it.
It’ll hit close to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule out what could be causing this power-sap, i.e. is it the air or fuel or a clogged cat or exhaust, etc. or something entirely different?
I ruled out “different”, I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone else’s narcissistic mom treat you like you’re overreacting about your period pains?
Hey!
I read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangerous.
Is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2-month Boston Terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.
My friends think she said that because she was with her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up, etc.
Others think it’s a way for her to be evil, like think of me, because I’m never coming to get that charm.
I think it’s some type of hoover, good or bad.
Any insight is appreciated.
If you’re a woman, please tell me your perspective.
So confused, but she is clearly with someone else, and why couldn’t she call me back and why didn’t she respond to my text messages?
She could’ve said “I’m with my boyfriend, please don’t call me”, but she didn’t.
Just a side note: my boyfriend and I are buying a house.
We will be moving out in 2 months.
Once the papers are all finalized.
I have an Australian Shepherd, 9 months.
My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) got her at 3 months.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with, a black Labrador and a small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a Rat Terrier.
Their play style is boxing.
And one of my room mates (25M) has a Beagle.
He doesn’t like to play much.
In fact, he seems kind of scared too.
I know all of these things about my dog.
I know that it doesn’t matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise, doesn’t matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business.
What matters is that my dog is nervous.
So when I hold my hand out and tell you, “no, he’s not sitting or lying down because he’s calmly waiting for you to say hi, it’s because he’s nervous and insecure”, I don’t mean it as a joke, and it’s not an invitation for you to say, “aw, well my dog/child is very friendly, so let me approach!”
I don’t care if your dog/child is friendly or “dog savvy”.
I don’t care if your dog “is just a puppy”.
(why the hell is that even relevant?
Is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies?).
I don’t care if your child is capable of not screeching “oh my God, a puppy”.
Can you, you know, do something about your child? And also your dog?
But with less than 3 months to go for that, I feel I’m not ready yet, but having never taken it, I have nothing to compare it to besides colleagues’ advice.
Without knowing what I know, they can’t know if I’m actually ready yet, but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this bad and it would be awesome to be done 6 months from my introductory exam.
I’m close...
I just don’t know if I’m 2 months study close.
Some certified advice.
(M/5’10”/26/165-195lbs) 2 months progress, am I gaining too much weight?
I passed my FAA PPL written!
I know this sounds weird, but here’s my issue.
About 4 months ago, I had an 3700X which died after start, crashing when I tried to play games, and a day later not booting.
I sent to RMA, they confirmed the CPU was dead and gave my money back after 2 months.
After that I got an 3800X.
As soon as I tried, I got the boot code 7b, everything powered up but no reboots or video signal.
I sent to RMA this time with the store.
After 1 month they confirmed the CPU was faulty and sent me a new one.
I got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom (T) has always been the type where her feelings matter first and only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone else’s fault entirely.
For example: I needed someone to babysit our then 2-month-old for 3-4 hours.
Dad’s work had someone who had Covid.
We opted out of them watching our son and asked my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her before I set it all up, because I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its my fault and she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her days after the incident, because she didn’t call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing, T promptly got off the phone.
I never got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to T’s narcissism.
I don’t expect an apology from T, because she never has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5 months, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2 months, he’s co
-
slept with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I’ve been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get a 2-month baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (currently replacing pacifier every hour).
First time mother to a sweet 2-month-old girl, and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
First time mother struggling with sleeps.
So I already have an orange golden chinchilla (Toto, 2 months old) and we have had Toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got Terri (2-month Himalayan Ragdoll) to keep each other company.
It’s only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor.
Just always going “brr rrr rrr”.
I’m not sure if she has a blocked nose, because Toto never made this kind of sound...
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
I can’t play until tomorrow but would like to know, so I can make money hunting or robbing everything and everyone.
How much do pelts sell for online?
Alright everyone, I think I mis-tagged this earlier, so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily with a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, and lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running (I have no issue with being over 12 feet from other people - I usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then I have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually I’m quietly confident going into these games but with injuries, players missing etc., I’m kind of happy if we get a draw.
I know they’re utter piss and paper-wise, we should be wiping the floor with them, but I’m just not feeling the 2/3-nil vibe at the moment!
Anyone want to talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
This is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait never mind, shit meme.
I was 6 and playing Lego Rock Band, I decided to ask for the Buddy Holly pack.
My parents (despite being in their 40’s) said “how the shit do you know that?”
I never realised that my parents got into Weezer.
So that’s how I got into Weezer.
I genuinely don’t understand how “toxic” behavior is more punished than literally int or troll.
Well, I’ve had an account which always received those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until I got in a bad streak of losses in ranked, and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior....
And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in-game chat for toxic behavior after a report doesn’t understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait until the morning, but then I said “never mind, I just realized it’s almost 2.
I’ll just wait”.
And then he asked what would happen if I ate it right now and I said nothing.
It’s just too late.
Now he’s telling me to just say “fuck it” and just eat the cereal.
So inspiring, but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :-(
Before I realized it was 2.
Help, lol, oh wait, I can just Google it.
Never mind, lol
How to delete a subreddit.
I know your skin isn’t perfect or you’re insecure about your nose or looks.
But those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You’re beautiful, because you’re you.
Rant over.
Actually, never mind.
God, why did you give me this huge ass nose?
I’m too ugly to even rant on Snapchat, so I do it on Reddit instead.
Ok, it’s over now.
Hopefully.
Can I get an RIP in the chat boys?
I was trying to go to sleep, because I couldn’t, when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked, but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says, because she only said my name in all caps and then a “never mind”.
Fuck.
I just realized I’m complaining over a 5-minute fix…
I had never heard of this “influencer” before and consider myself pretty internet savvy.
I then lost interest in her, because her Instagram wasn’t that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread, and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out, and then I took a great interest in checking in on her, because I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while: How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her lots of money, because she claims to not be able to afford food or rent or whatever, when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers, which aren’t cheap.
I don’t like him or anything, but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my boyfriend with him.
I wouldn’t do that to him of course, but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
Me: I’m highkey liking boys more right now.
lol, this is no culture.
I’m still trying to fucking finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.
And it’s my actual birthday tomorrow, lol.
This is not meant as a rant.
It’s only just informing Oro mains that they look noobs whenever they play Oro.
Never mind, I guess this is a rant.
Never mind, it’s back up.
That’s like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying “ah, never mind, I want to eat somewhere else” as soon as they’re bringing the food out.
I played a game as Rengar and I was 6/2 and got solo killed by Anvia who didn’t have Rod of Ages or Tear finished yet.
I looked over at the replay 100 times and all I can think to my self is, if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did, the Anivia will win CNA.
Someone please explain why the fuck an Anivia is strong than a Rengar in a 1v1 when the Rengar has a gold lead?
Actually, never mind.
I don’t care.
I’m just quitting this brain dead game.
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage and both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds and says “never mind”, so I just gave her mine and went on with my day.
I’m so sick of hearing the same beats of Mexican music, ahh!
Edit:
I lied: the party started at 8 am and the music stopped just now at 7:30 pm.
God, if I have to go through this every weekend, I’ll just kill myself.
Edit 2:
lol, 10 minutes later, never mind, the music started again.
What the fuck!
Edit 3:
It started raining, so the party ended haha!
People go in the dark alone.
No one could be that stupid!
If there’s a ghost in the house, why the hell would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a little too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they’re screwed.
4. The fuck are you splitting up for?!
There’s always this one guy in horror movies that’s like: “Guys, there’s a crazy ass killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed”!
That’s exactly what the killer wants!
Basically, I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again because my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her), and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this Reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh never mind, he’s good” and “P90 is broken.
I’m quitting the game”.
lol, never mind, I’m still here.
I can’t sleep.
lmao, it’s just me, never mind.
Just what the title says.
Do you pick up insects and spiders with your bare hands?
I’m deathly afraid of insects and spiders, so I don’t know what to do.
I want to kill them before they get away.
Play a scuffed 24-hour WOW livestream filled with condescending undertones, belittling, and shitty half-assed ill-prepared gameplay.
Throw begging, depression and sob stories on top of it and call it couples stream.
An Altarian virus, anything is possible.
In fact, that day on Onias Three, you were infected with the cell of its hosts ten days ago.
You have been in a coma, delirious.
Your fever broke this morning.
I don’t have one, because I’m 17 and haven’t gotten around to it (and no, I’m not driving, because I’m terrified) and that I haven’t gotten my gender marker changed, so no updated documents at all.
I have a passport from a while ago from before transitioning, so that doesn’t have an updated name either.
So I have no idea what to do, because I’m going to an event with them on the 14th.
If it helps, my dad’s a flight attendant (has been for like ever).
Should I cancel?
There is always next year, but, like, I’m lonely in real life, because my boyfriend is an hour away, and as much as I love my other real life buddies, I’d like a breath of fresh air :-(
I don’t know if I will.
If I do, I will be in my mid 30’s, because I want to live life my way.
But I need to have sex to have kids and that isn’t going to happen (because honestly “me too”).
I have to go camping for a scuba certification.
There is a grill and they will eat burgers.
But I am on a vegetarian diet.
(I eat some animal products but much less than I did before.
I eat 80% vegetarian)
I got pretty close with an equalizer with a little low end and high end shaved off, going into a soft clipper.
The equalizer before it makes it Slam.
I was going to try distortion and a limiter after, when I get off work.
(The limiter was highly suggested in the last post, so hopefully that’ll do the trick)
I’m just looking for advice!
What should I do from here? Someone please let me know.
You can easily get an infinite powerlock in longer fights.
I have a 4/40 Dr Octopus, and I see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and SPS, so not bad in damage either (like vision).
A very viable option for AW attack.
and also arenas, as you don’t have to bait out in those small fights, because you never let them reach SP3 before you finish it.
Get ready boys.
Pogo will not open for me.
It keeps saying this device is blah blah blah… you guys know what I’m talking about.
Anyway, to fix this, I am on Android 6.0 before the security update and I have root with Magisk 16.0.
Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise, what with having a storyline that doesn’t come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and necessary amount of seriousness and comedy.
The characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert, Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events don’t always have to rely on Neptune’s presence.
Great bait, mate.
I relate, straight appreciate, and congratulate.
I rate this bait an 8/8.
Please no hate, I’m straight irate.
Create more, Can’t wait.
We should conversate.
I won’t berate.
My number is 8888888,
I’ve taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take no more.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: Meh, ok, that’s fine.
They then use shit like A subtract 1 through A subtract 20 for variables.
In fact, I have a linear algebra book that did this... A’s for everything.
The pages were just matrices filled with A’s.
Just draw a weird shape or something - anything but that shit!
Scariest thing ever mate.
Well, well, here we are again, frustrated, angry in front of my phone.
What a neat way to start isn’t it?
All of you readers are my therapy and I don’t owe you a cent.
Perfect, right?
If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all because of your short attention span, so let’s keep it short (what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying “keep it short - I’m a genius aren’t I?”)
Well I tried explaining to my buddies that porn is kind of shabby, and yeah just bad, and you know who listened…
Hey, I just want to know what games I can run on this PC and which not.
I was a spy, and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told the jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, Mafia and Serial Killer had made their kills.
I proudly said: “I was attacked while in jail!”
Wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and asks me “You were attacked while you were in jail?” and I answer “yes mate”.
He then tells me that what I am saying is bullshit, because Serial Killer and Mafia have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously?!
Like, I don’t really care what mean, shit people on the internet say.
But when I got nobody in real life, all I have is the internet, and it does kind of hurt a bit when I just want to vent my problems.
And I’d be fine if it got maybe a single upvote and no comments, and I’d be fine.
But instead, it’s full of people saying
Oh boy, you are too dumb for the movie, boy.
The director was like “shit, it’s about the hidden meanings you have to find, boy, like you know it doesn’t spoon-feed you the film, you know?”
Like shit, why does it have to explain, mate.
Just imagine what happened, you know?
It’s not like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has, you know?
Yet when fully charged for the first 30-60 minutes, it’s always on!
Which is beautiful!
Lastly, if I do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping), the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off.
What the fuck, mate?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone, or is it just me?
In searching Google, I cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues, I am really enjoying the mod.
It’s just a fucking ball ache every single time I want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before I can puff...
Every time I log on, I want to chill away from keyword NMZ, and play Xbox and be fat, right, but lately I log on, play RS away from keyword for like 20 seconds and I get logged out, and it’s fucking annoying.
Is it my internet connection or is it the servers or what?
It’s pissing me off, mate.
Next we have my statistics class, and I didn’t realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework; and so my grade was a 70 something, and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my band class is basically easy A as it’s show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert, and so I passed that.
Good game, easy, mate.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do not go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like “what the fuck, mate?” and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after, I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there.
Did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This year’s rookie game is actually going to be real exciting. What line-ups do you want to see?
I love this show, but sadly I’m near to finishing it already.
What is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story?
I never watch movies or… so sorry about my lack of vocabulary on this though, is this called dystopian?
Well I’m really lost, but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy!
Has it happened to anyone else?
It happened to me a number of times.
So if you’re on leg 2, you have to win 10 consecutive games for the XP and coins, 10 stamina for 40 tickets.
Get the fuck out of here, EA!
Her: Oh, where’s this ice luge, haha?
Me: Probably my friend’s hotel room or wherever he can find a place for it.
Me:
I came to <insert city> with my fraternity and a sorority – that’s why he’s getting it.
Her: Gotcha!
Her: What fraternity and sorority I’m in xxx.
Me: yyy.
sorority is zzz.
Me: You’re interesting though.
I want to hang out with you.
When this week?
Her: Uh, maybe Friday?
Me: Ah, yes.
Me: Friday.
*one day later*
Me: <girl’s name>, we’re hanging out tomorrow, right?
I don’t like when people type huge paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me about their problems.
I don’t like when people mumble on the phone or if they ramble on, and it’s all about them.
But now it just doesn’t make sense.
You only get 1 ticket per match, and if you are lucky, you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the one thing free-to-play was always able to do because of the low cost of entrance and the rewards were good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you don’t like him, use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you don’t like the new WT, then don’t play it.
Closed tech support?
It’s, 1:30am and you’re a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
What the literal fuck?
Was your heating bill too much this month so you can’t make your rent?
You mismanaged bunch of fools.
So, long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall ’22 semester, and I’m on the waitlist since April.
Housing isn’t guaranteed when you’re not a freshman, and my income isn’t enough for rent so… There’s a possibility, I might be homeless.
My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No fucking competition.
Most men this day are thirsty as fuck.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half-assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains, they grab and grunt at everything with two legs.
And I mean that literally.
But – that’s good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24M), an accountant at a traveling company.
We ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today I called one of our agents and a girl picked up.
She was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts, and she said “yes, I will be at your company at 21:00”.
I said “ok, and at 21:00, she came by and asked who is the accountant”.
I said “I am, please follow me to the room”.
She came and I asked her how much did she bring.
She said “I have $1300 with me”, which will not cover all of their debts by the way, so I brought a receipt and wrote down the amount and the company name and then I asked her for her name.
She smiled and looked at me and said my name.
So none of my friends are answering me 😭😭 So, it’s time to make some new ones!
I’m in the mood to call, so let me know if you’re down!
Looking to talk to people around my age.
I’ve posted before so you can check out my profile for more info.
I’m a little lazy right now 🥴
Anyways, let me know what your favorite type of music is 🙃
I had been wearing Lane Bryants Lounge Bras the past four-ish years, and so this was the first time in a very long time that I wore a bra with wire.
So come Monday, I wore my new bra with wire that fit perfectly at the store, but after a few hours it felt so uncomfortable!
I am worried I wasted my money… :-(
I’m so miserable and seriously just want to cancel my trip but don’t want to disappoint my husband.
He’s been looking forward to a vacation for so long.
I’m dreading the plane ride so bad!
Luckily the flare is a bit higher and not right where I make contact when sitting, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.
I’m going to be walking around in 40 degree weather with a big angry boil on my ass.
God help me 😫
Hey, there.
I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of “you” or “your”, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
Just type out the word.
It isn’t hard.
Hi guys, I was drinking with my friends from the US and my boyfriend and everyone’s fallen asleep, and I want to play some truth or dare or drink, so if you have Discord or Kik, just message me, owo
So I just had my baby with the man of my dreams 4 months ago :-) and it felt like I was living my fairytale life.
I was in my exact vision I had, but then, long story short, postpartum with new emotions had me pull a crazy move and I checked his phone about a month ago now, only to find out he was meeting up with a chick, doing favors for her, spending time in her room and texting a lot, all while I was pregnant.
Now he and her both say they are just friends and never hooked up (yes, I contacted her number), lol, but I don’t want to lose my man, though I also saw he has dating profiles and he says he doesn’t do it all the time.
And he won’t do it anymore.
I don’t want my baby’s parents to split, plus I love him and want our vision to carry on.
But how?
Please help.
Can I?
Or should I trust him again ?
Day 17 of posting Corgi stuff (sorry for not posting for so long)
I have insomnia and I can’t sleep at night, and it’s just like I have so many ideas at night that just so many ideas keeping my up at night.
Please tell me how sometimes I can get better sleep.
Because of that, I almost failed school and because of skipped lessons, and people tell me to listen, but just, like, I talk with somebody, and then I just think of something.
I forgot what I was about to say, and I had a math tutor, but iI couldn’t focus and just also my mind is like chaos people.
Tell me.
Oh, I don’t want to take medication and I’m sensitive to medicine.
Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that.
She probably already has one also.
A real digital movie camera costs so damn much.
So I opted for an analog one.
Now, 8mm/Super 8 have an affordable price, 16mm doesn’t cost much, and 35mm costs a lot, so I think I’m going for a Super 8.
But then how does it work?
lol, I mean, I buy her a Super 8, but I should also buy her a video recorder, and some VHS… things like that.
I don’t know how it works.
Please can someone explain to me what should I do.
How do you guys do it?
It’s so scary, but I want to last forever with him, and I know I can’t tell the future, but we’ve been through so much together.
How do you guys keep it going through all the obstacles life throws at you... how?
Do you want to run some Minecraft? XD
I’m bored and my friends are busy or out right now, so...
I finished the game for the first time today.
What a wonderful and amazing game.
It hits right in the feels and fucks your mind up at times.
My ending was sad.
Kara and Alice die (I am bad at controls), North dies, Hank dies, Marcus is successful, but I let Connor kill him, because I guess I was doing kind of a role-play where Connor is the villain and the outcome is realistic.
I will try to open other openings.
But yes, the game was so good.
Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!
Maybe a little earlier, I don’t know, because I’m usually at work, but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mb/s range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more people are at home I’m going to see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60…
I am an aspiring doctor/medical student, and so seeing a lot of medicine-related subjects as early in our first semester I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!
I passed for UPLB BS Biology!
To be honest though, this wasn’t my priority program, so of course I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be a scholar, but I was also worried, because I’m not really as interested in Biology as invested I already was in Physical Therapy.
Sure, I could learn to love Biology, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year, but that’s not certain.
I will play with anyone on 2K21.
I’m an 87 over 3 level scorer.
As one that will play with anyone, REP and OVR don’t matter.
I have no one to play with most of the time, and no randoms want to play with me.
Please play with me.
I promise I won’t sell.
I can shoot.
I have an 81 three, but I can shoot.
I’m a shooting guard.
I need someone who knows how to land planes on PC to help me.
That’s all.
I just need you to land the plane.
I know how to do the rest of the mission, but the plane has been messing me up for hours.
Please help as soon as possible.
My discord is SingSong254.
Contact me there, then I’ll give you my Ubisoft account information.
Thanks.
Help, I need someone who knows how to fly planes well on PC to join me.
Let’s fucking go!
What’s up guys?
I drop around 30 kills a game right now, and I’m trying to get out of low ranks and get into Platinum.
If you’re good at the game but simply don’t have a Stack, add me on Discord and we can rank up together.
Just to clarify, when I say “anything” I mean anything within the FM’s current power.
So no answers like “remove the nukes” or “boot the royals”.
We cannot do that (not yet at least…).
You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.
What do you do?
Me and my real life friends need a team that we (or especially I) can VOD review in order to learn about tarping, switching layers and positioning.
I was thinking Wolf/Soldier/Wilkinson but I’m not sure if there are any better ones.
Preferably EU as we are EU, and some stuff happening is basically exclusive to EU, lol, but I guess it could be NAE as well.
Thank you!
Looking for someone to play with right now.
No toxics and no obnoxious people.
I don’t fuck with that.
18+ NAE.
I just play for fun.
You can be bad.
I don’t care about skills 😇
One word I simply can’t say properly is water...
It actually hurts my brain trying to add the T, and I sound American if I do or still say wut-ta.
I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to say, to be honest.
I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when you meet people who drop H’s and have glottal stops.
I’m curious how likely it is that a post on my personal space will be shown to people. Please write “+” in the comment if you see this.
So I got a Sky Q Mini Box for upstairs.
It doesn’t work.
I have to wait until late March for an engineer. lol
So I will be starting a job next week and desperately need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
Looking for single bedroom flats or flat-shares is a legitimate issue as three letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
Vacuum won’t stop sucking.
Please send help.
Is it going to blow?
Basically, if you didn’t know what that is, it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Let’s eat granny” making it seem like someone’s going to eat their nan.
However, the other example says “Lets eat, granny”, implying a different meaning to the sentence.
A pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas, I guess.
I literally couldn’t have been more at fault I just drove straight into this woman’s Golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it).
She seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it’s my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers as well, just very minor body work and paint, maybe a small dent.
What broadband do I get?
I’ve had Virgin for 8 years, and holy shit, is it slow for £40 monthly.
Is it the old router or do I just switch to a cheaper BT or whatever?
Jeans, T-shirt, steel-cap boots, boiler suit (lol), high vis, gloves, goggles, dust mask, ear protection.
Help.
I’m melting…
Edit: the heat has got to my spelling ability first.
The end is nigh.
I’m sure as eggs is eggs that I’m not the only one that goes to the gas pump, and I want say £10, 9 times out of 10 it will go £10.01.
Bloody things are rigged like a slot machine, I swear, lol.
lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn’t actually laugh to.
LOL - adults and people who don’t really know how the internet works use this
Lol - I’m not sure why this came up, but it’s likely an autocorrect, but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named.
LoL - Grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
It’s also confusing because of League of Legends.
loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with “spool”, but I think it’s the drawn-out “o”.
So yeah, I think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn’t exist.
lolll - when I hear her say “loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it.
but I still think that’s “loool”,
You can’t repeatedly pronounce a consonant.
So, when is Big Ben going to bong again?
Hm, mandatory title.
But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Preferably under £50!
Also, does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming (that don’t require me to stand for lengths of time).
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what I do, I literally can’t keep the dust at bay for more than 24 hours, and I am losing my mind.
It’s 10pm, 28°C, and my bum is literally melting.
Saturday session three and chat.
If this bear isn’t named Beary McBearface, we have failed as a society.
It’s 32°C here inside my flat.
I have taken the t-shirt off and soaked it in cold water.
I’m wearing it.
What genius ways are you keeping cool whilst working from home or somewhere extremely hot with no AC?
Bloody lovely fucking weather, isn’t it?
16 hours in Wetherspoons.
Okay, so I went out with my girlfriend to go to 7-11 and I had my hair in my face, a hoodie, and a mask, and someone called me he/him.
Bruh, I’m so happy right now, what the fuck (I’m non-binary and use all pronouns, but nobody has ever used he/him for me and it feels really good)
To the neighbor that went out of their way just to check on me, I appreciate that.
I just wanted to say from one Gen Z to Millennials, good on you guys.
I hope you find what you’re looking for.
It’s been fun being your little buddies in life.
If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet, everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really, to be honest.
Remember, there’s a lot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that doesn’t experience a lot of positive moments, this subreddit does make me smile :-)
Damn, some people need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet, Jesus!
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kind of a lot, lol), so I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I don’t see the need, because who the fuck cares?
But now it seems that you’re all making grits without the butter and making us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were preparing to tour more plantations than Carter’s got little pills but you done gone and brought up them “slave owners” now.
It isn’t amounting to anything more than a hill of beans!
If I had my druthers, I’d have just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt something decent about history.
All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
You get along now, do you hear?
How to go from number to date?
How do I break off a relationship with my “friend”?
Basically, I put my skate account in my Instagram biography, because I have no posts on my main, and I’m kind of insecure about my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless, and people won’t expect me to be like shredded or some shit if they add me), and today I got 3 followers (girls from different towns who don’t know me).
I’m really picky though, because I don’t want to have a relationship, unless I actually feel like I’d really like the person and be into them a lot, so I didn’t follow any of them back.
Bro, I’ve been added and un-added on Instagram so many times today that it’s kind of a confidence boost, lmao.
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from people who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers, smh… I have nothing else to say, come at me angry people, lmao.
Hi guys, I’m a casual just-for-fun gamer, playing 5-6 games a week.
Yesterday it was just pure horror division 10…
I could not win 1 game out of 6…
Like, is everyone smurfing ? Or what’s going on?
I know people want to play the objective.
I get that, but why do you need to shush or watch full replay or every cut scene?
So basically, for my A-levels I got 82 RP and wanted to go the NUS business administration but didn’t get in, though I’m quite sure my grade is good enough, and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago…
*welp
* :-(
I got into SMU business administration, but I still feel damn shit that I didn’t get into NUS, so help change my mind and convince me why SMU is better than NUS, especially for business :-/
I’m most scared that in the future when I’m working, people will look down on SMU like elitism discrimination all that, I don’t know, man.
Or will they pay less or not even hire me?
RIP, because SMU is kind of 2nd best and less well known.
I would really appreciate if you all could help me out, especially those who are currently at university or have already left.
Thanks pals :-)
TLDR: the title.
Other vegans that you’re friends with tell you that they don’t tell other people that they’re vegan.
Like, they purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community, because they are probably the people that would be more gentle with their words, which is what some people need in order to listen.
I’m a very straightforward, no sugarcoating type of person, and although some people appreciate it, a lot more get upset and start trying to put words in my mouth and twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like €300 worth of fake internet points, like, what the fuck are you doing, honestly? lol
Why would you give awards to people? lol
I just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre-googling and confirmed the time that I’ll be there.
If she gives any further resistance, I think I’ll just next her, ignore her, not respond to her, agree with her that she can’t handle the place, or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first freaking date.
Yes, I agree things like Tumblr made-up identities are weird, and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted, calling people snowflakes is just weak.
Give yourself a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without any unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series!
Props to you!
The New Year’s Eve Raticate with a hat.
I haven’t found him anywhere yet.
Does anyone want to raid?
I need a few people quick.
Stop.
I think what I am trying to say… this game is not hard.
Don’t make it hard yourself.
The main objective, as I understood, is to get the dragon, and don’t die before that.
Even better if you outfarm your opponent.
Just don’t die.
And trades in lane… if you see the enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights, but he was out of town.
So we couldn’t do that, and now he’s back in town, and I asked him what he’s doing on New Year’s Eve and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers from our work.
And like, he didn’t offer an invite, and then he said if he cancels with them, would I like to come over, and I just said I don’t know what I’m doing yet, so I don’t know.
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There are going to be people on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid.
Hey, the regulars!
I just wanted to say that I love the group channel, it’s amazing, and love your own channels as well.
I love all your videos, and I have a suggestion for a video for the channel: Do a Minecraft build battle and whoever loses there, the other people get to write something on their Twitter, lol.
I hope you like my idea and can use it for a video.
I have a group chat.
It’s on Discord for people who are bored or want to chat about anything.
We already have some people who chat and stuff about anything.
It’s chill, edgy, and if you want to join, comment and I’ll direct message you the link.
I just kind of realized that I’ve never had New Year’s Eve plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that…
I recently realized that I still don’t have enough friends to have one for my 21st coming up…
I don’t know why I didn’t clue into this though.
Like, I never thought about how people have traditions for this night, besides my sister, who goes out to her friends’ every year.
It’s funny that Covid isn’t affecting my New Year at all…
Is anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway, I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight, lol.
Hello, I’m looking for people to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
Just please be aware that I’m not very good at upholding conversations.
uwu F/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the Word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the “aaa” word, and I want to yank four words without selecting the spaces after “ddd”: > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like, I see videos on YouTube on it.
But like, I can’t see any mention on the design notes, etc. Where do people get the information from?
DM me to debate.
Please be well learned in your belief.
I want DMs, because it’ll get deep and I can’t reply to 300 people like that.
Also, I need 500 characters so here come the blah blahs.
I’m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I’m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl, but I am saying that they won’t like to do it, because they are humans with their own choices, and not agreeing to be a girl isn’t making them a women anti.
Like, how many guys around you would be willing to be turned into Disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time but how much time?
And maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
But knowing this isn’t making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they are asked to do all this.
I wouldn’t like it if you tried to make me a man and wanted me to dance in front of so many people, even though I am a tomboy.
Is anyone missing me?
If you miss a Reddit friend, read this.
It could be me!
So I just hopped on PC from PS4, not even 2.5k games played there.
I played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a keyboard and mouse, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with people 2000 kills and predators even.
Yet I haven’t even a hundred games played and about 80 kills with all characters.
I’m not really having fun anymore.
I can’t improve if I get shit on every game.
I see a lot of people on here who seem hella sad, so if you’re really sad, I’m up for a chat.
So yeah if you are up for a chat, or long-term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so.
So I always see people talk about sending designs and edits to Affinity, but how do I do that?
I’ve worked at OD for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it.
Like not even the print suppliers.
We do every type of editing in store and I hate it.
Like we’re out here doing stuff that I’m pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to Affinity based on what I see on here.
But yeah, is more of this information on the store portal or where can I learn more?
I’m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last-minute, rude customers :-)
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k, and I was like “Hell no, that’s not worth 100k”, like bruh.
Why do people find the new set expensive?
I know the girl I posted about is a troll people, but oh well, she’s got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down.
It is the bar with the team composition and the status of each character that is used to follow “report team” (like in the actual World Cup).
It can be tweaked down to not reveal too much information about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier, and you won’t have to use tab.
Hit me up with a chat message.
Tell me about yourself and we can go from there.
I don’t understand how people can build what they do...
I love building but I guess my creativity isn’t well tuned as a lot of people’s is, and it bothers me that I can’t build amazing stuff.
I know I could if had the creative side, ugh!
I just tend to give up after a while and settle for simple crap to pass for ok.
I care about how I affect people a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in conversations with big groups of people, which is related to ADHD.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kind of stand-offish to people I don’t know.
I’ll try to act like I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me but drunk people will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all are ADHD things though, because of rejection sensitive dysphoria.
I’m a good listener.
A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent.
I can have a really, really, really flirty personality at times.
I remember in high school, my friend’s mom said I had the “personality”, so I’d probably be the first to have a boyfriend.
But when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds her accountable, she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects anyone/everyone who doesn’t agree with her and screams about how she doesn’t care.
Or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck”.
She’ll never take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite.
All the things she screams at people to not do to her, she turns around and does the exact same rude, petty shit to anyone/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her.
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts just like my mom, and my mom can’t stand it/accept that So she becomes downright nasty.
In class, I’ve usually been really quiet, but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click with in class and be really, really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen B, feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk though.
I’ve always been a smiley, happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have ADHD.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really, really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk - I heard people with ADHD are both.
Could I be ISTP?
Help type me please.
I don’t know if people would even want to.
I just want to know if that’s allowed, and if not, where would be a good place to post that.
(I’ve watched Dragonmar and other people’s videos but that would be hard to be a me-specific video on there)
Like in a good way though.
Some people are just indescribable.
I haven’t done this before, but I’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like…interests :-)
We can definitely talk about anime (especially romance - I’m a sucker for it), we can talk about games and go into detail about lore and stuff, creepy stories go hard, and really I’m just down for anything :-)
I’m not gonna be weird so long as you’re not weird.
Any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah… if I didn’t do this right let me know :-)
Oh and I’ll absolutely talk more on Snap.
The part I’m humming is like “word word word wo-o-o-ord” twice.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like “fly-y-y-yyy.”
I’m pretty sure it’s a popular song; I’ve heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah, to be honest it is.
I care about a lot of people and I can’t just... make people be happy.
But like… I want to :-(
I just want to make everybody I care about happy.
Like, is that too much to ask?
I think that some people here are AI or something.
smh, don’t even try.
I can do that by myself 🤠
Hey, F/19, bored as fuck.
I enjoy talking to new people.
Hit me up!
I started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90’s.
She said everyone was watching wrestling back then, and it was a cool thing.
Now no one gives a shit 😭 (I don’t really blame them sometimes).
I asked her “why do you think people stopped liking it”, and she said “because it’s garbage.
It’s come on Fox on Fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hits, I change the channel”.
I had to include that in there, because she’s so funny 😂😂😂
Anyways…
Hey, I can’t fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting.
Hit me up if you think we could hit it off well.
I hope we have a great time, future chat buddy ;-) 😁
It’s kind of weird, I’m not going to lie.
These motherfuckers can outrun, outswim or outstam (through venom) anything that tries to get them.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
I just finished the show so I’m a little behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much, lol.
Also by sidestory I mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
My favorite Obama quote: "Michael and I also wanna uh, acknowledge, uh.....yy...y.yy..uuuhhh..yyy....your son Jack, who deployed today."
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc
Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best game ever that I play!
But have some probs..
I’d always heard of mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple months ago and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists rn.
Anyways that was just my thoughts,
Happy new years everyone
hope the new year treats u well.
Now for this one it's kinda hard because the enemies are SOOO COOL for this game, but... If I had to choose, I'd say I like the Clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not THE only enemie in the game that doesn't have a single other Variation from what I remember.
Honestly I wasn't gonna make one but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I dsagree with a lot of others list,
not to say my list is right bc this is all subjective anyway which Is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
YAYYYY
Imo lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind ive only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of ep 3)
unlike her father lily tries to work with lee and for the most part the group
she does what she has to
she is a bit of a bitch cause she has to
i only have 1 problem with lily
she killed carly
if you could get ben to confess
yes i got spoiled on that and a few other things
ben is useless
he is what looks like a collage student yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7
pls dont downvote me into oblivion if i missed something
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats
so 4 isn't really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kinda sucks IMO.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who lived both as a woman and as a man
(not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
so thats kinda neat imo
I don't think he did the role justice.
I feel before neo figured it out the way he was speaking was ok, but after...IMO he should of went full Hugo weaving speech.
Just wanted to share my opinion not being a united fan, on the game against burnley.
(not that many of you will care).
Mctominay sheeeeesh what a guy.
Thought that shaw was solid,
now youve got two good left backs in good form.
Also wanted to say awb had a muhc better game i thought.
AFter the shitty games and dalot playing well I personaly thought awb improved alot.
Hahaha.
OMG it's terribl-....yyy funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can ONLY drop at 4-6,
yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues but for me I can live with those issues but not this,
pls change
Kind of an odd question imo, but I have a bp who I just got to eat f/t for the first time (yay!!!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I've tried f/t large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
Could be a fluke though.
Ik it's like a meme or something of "dark souls player complains about the combat" or something similar, but I just don't get the combat.
I can do ds3 deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately,
ik not a difficult game but hear me out rq if you know the game.
OMG!
WHY do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they dont have ANY idea of how a torrent even works (its so damn easy though!)
comments like "The link doesnt work" Rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
Your just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So i get tipped on the app, gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the app after?
Wtf is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was LESS than the app tip...
If your are tipping both, TIP BOTH.
Ngl tft is a good mode ,but its like hs a good game to play on your phone not something to grind out all day all night like wtf ?
Its not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on prep up and alt tab until its next time u can do anyhing)
any thoughts?
i know its a scientific things and all but some of the post there is just too much.
learning dream languages???
wtf?
and some bloke is saying "i tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didnt lucid dream?!" every few hours.
maybe the post are just giving a litte too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like Dear lord wtf is happening ooooh
So I am I first time cup user and i got the saalt cup at target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold+17yovirgin=ow)
I got in in w/the 7 fold and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how tf am i supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails.
In one way, it kind of helped me ~find~ the cup lowkey grip but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping
I'm down to my last dollars soon and I can't just eat beer and cigarettes
then I set them down so I didn't have to carry them across the street to get beer (it's cheaper at Adventures First Stop)
then I walked back and forgot my groceries
walked all the way home and ah shit, I'm getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill
I live on a hill. down. the middle, really.
i imagine it's like an amateur San Fran
so I walked back and got them.
no crime round these parts.
not much, anyway.
Didn’t think about nails...
Is he gonna tell her?
If so how would that convo go down?!!!?
Okay wtf Arlo now knows sera ( idk how to spell her full name) is Johns weakness
First of all, we've seen they are greedy as f(OK, not as other mobile studios, but stiiiiiill)
Second, game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high end phones)
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
Wtf are you yanks on
See also:
(on an article about how it's "40 degrees in some parts of Europe")
> wtf lol that's not hot at all
put on a jakcet dummies
("[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16C")
> zomg thats rly cold
im never moving to canada
Someines it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me tf out and gives me nods similar to codiene,
why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with wether or not a woman looks at me and thinks Im ugly,
if that happens I get anxious From it,
but ifva women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks im decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
WTF IS GOING ON
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisble, even if they don't detect you they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I shouldve just grabbed an smg and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many trys most of them being on his second phase,
his 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7 place on last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Becuz i have less than 3000 points.
(i need 55 magaki frags and i get 50, just feel my suffering)
Also in other event with gamer764 i have \~8000 points and got 4 place and got rewards for 4 place, not for 1,
whats need 7k points or more.
Are the developers too greedy?
Hope the title makes sense -
Have a list of names "john.baker" (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 colums "john" and "baker"
Thanks!!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were goin to see each other and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday and so I canceled it and now she won't stop saying sorry that's not what she meant.
Wtf do I do
I told her I was going on another one next month(lie) to make her feel better but I didn't.
But, I don't neccesarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks
Okay so I've got less than a chapter left in GotM and I still can't understand wtf Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I'm missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots
Yhall are whack
Wtf i posted a litteral anime foot and still didn't even make most controversial post of DAY. let alone all time
So huh you cant alpha karthus ult
wtf is this bs?
It would be very helpful all of you OP's out there actually said wtf it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it!
Such as "now I understand why this (brand name) thing has everyone going crazy"...
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn't mean much to me.
If it's too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever that the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the "DFW teams are cursed" camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me to much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential WTF transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a pc but in the mean time I use a crappy 13 year old pc
I got money for rust bought it and it took 4 hours to download 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server
after I hit a tree with my rock my game crashed

GF: This isn't meant for kids.
GT: But its mine I found it and finders keepers.

She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot n cold.
Now shes onto another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind if disrespectful to the new bf huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd,
however, i will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her but i cant think of a reason why i should…
After going "uhh no?" She sends me a picture of said candle holder.From her kitchen.
I of course go "wtf you're home??" and turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So Im beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
Tldr: sickly nmom went into hospital for 3 days,
I find out shes home because of a candle holder.
ts been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but its really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is i let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message i sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful bc of a song i made that i was sharing.
I was very flirtatious maybe more so than i was with my gf when i was first talking to her and that has been choing in my gfs mind.
Its been extremely difficult for her
we have two dogs now
i was hoping us having two pups to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again bc we have them to bond over but she still cant say "i love you too"
she doesnt accept when i try to give her compliments bc ive said rude things in the past when i use to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you but i dont see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trumming my nails, wearing versace crystal noir and ither fragrances etc. Which i believe is the reason why most girls even if theyre taken at least are willing to have a convo with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self development and even though ive been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, i never let it get me down and im so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women even though i may not have hollywood good looks or charidma like will smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and i wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :)
Shes 18 inches long & weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
Just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champ every 4-5 days and shes already longer than some males get so I'm curious!
the anime is about an mc thats in a game but she doesnt realise it but the system says shes dead and etc
i would like to wath the rest of it soo plz help me.
Lookking for a anime
Idk if to others its strange, but to me it was.
I got covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so i had to tell my mum.
I couldve just lied and say it was cuz of sharing cups or kissing a girl since in BI, but i knew my parents would be accepting...
so i told them as it was.
My mum was VERY dissapointed because she thought she new me well, and though i told her everything but now she couldnt trust me anymore cuz bla bla bla...
basically he was very dissapointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that i didnt feel like telling her because its private to me... till today
she doesnt really trust me like before, but shes ok lol.
Today its my birthday so im sharing my ''strange'' comming out story
I am confusion???
whats going on lol.
This is my first time with sfu mail,
after the sem I haven't touched anything school related until today heh, so idk how to fix this
So me and my friend started playing val again and want us to learn comms such as heaven and all of that,
now I know what heaven is but I don't know others and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If your still confused ill give a scenario "I hit the jett, shes in heaven" like the location.
Shes an awesome cook does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but shes not a good cook either LOL.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well
she cant be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or its a guy)
She's all nice and sweet to everyone else but she's just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong(not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it. Which is wrong,
when she is there she doesn't do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren't there.
The worst part about it is people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The "false advertising" on thr A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill were it says multiple buffs cant co exist.
Maybe im the only one but i think this is all dumb and alsp kills a lot of peoples excitement.
I dont like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star lol.
Its just like zhongli.
He was fine but everyone freaked because he wasnt doing enough to dumster content and was balanced.
Ive seen lots of ppl in the fandom make rude/racist comments about liberty and its disgusting
please leave her alone.
And you do realize shes black?
stop making fun of the actors ethnic features
its honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general
its not even funny
honestly its just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And its not even just liberty I've seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmys hair.
(also mods please dont take this down
I really want people to see it and I have done nothing wrong
I've been having some of my post randomly deleted for no reason)
( As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guac.)
She then told me we gave her less meat when I brought back THE SAME PLATE sans guac.
SHES HOME FOR THE FIRST TIMEE
SHESS FINNALLY BACKK
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my pup im her crate at night bc if i dont she will poop on the floor.
So theres already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then i have work - which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my corgi in my bathroom at this time because if i dont she will reek havoc unsupervised.
AITA for starting a fight with an old friend (Strong Swearing)
Even better for me it would be:
It would be an unbeleafable loss to leta broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, downthe sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of themerchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.
"Y-y-yyy-yes sire! May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!”
"Now get lost! This is no place for desease ridden vermin like you.”
"O-off course my lord!”
I ran. Back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and furhter out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on snapchat with my friend,
me and my friend were arguing as a "joke" and then she said she prefered older guys, and my friend was (M14) and i said im a year older than you, and she says "what i mean by older guys i mean age 17" and it hurt my heart.
TLDR; my crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and im 16 and shes 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here but idk if I am the butthole or entitled one this story,
this is short but I was expecting to get a tat for my 18 bday like any 18 year old but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to
I dm the artist I wanted but nothing for 2 months
like yea I understand they booked for summer tats but at least say "hey I am booked for the rest of ____"
but I was like ok will I am gonna look at another artist work from this shop that does small tats
same thing happens no answer
so me and my brother decides "ok let's go to the shop and ask then we well at least get a answer"
we go and this young girl attends us lets call her (brenda)
I told her everything,
brenda said "well u can do the tat with me"
I said "I'll be back i'll think about it"
I got back in the car and scroll through her work
it was good work so I went back and told her yea let's do this
I signed everything
she didn't even ask for ID which I found weird bc I gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on
I brushed it off since shes new and all
she worked on me for a hour told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her
I was like ok great thanks,
4 weeks passed and there was alot of mistakes made bc I got a small tat heartbeat with a ";" in the middle but the period on top was a small heart
the right side of the heart was smaller then the other side and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again
So I reset it and yeah oops was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn't dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry ? and like through text she kinda sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if shes mad and like she said shes only abit let down ?
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me and like i apologized to her and she said its alright .
Then i just told her im going to sleep and she just left my message on delivered and like she didnt reply to today.
How to tell whether she's mad at me or just annoyed cuz rn im really confused
WIBTA if I was just be a bigger sarcastic Asshole to another Asshole?
Her tumors are behinning to open through her skin, she wont jump, pain killers dont help, she ate a lot yesterday but wont eat or drink today, she hid most the day but..... Its hard because shes alert.
It feels wrong because she looks at me like "i love you.
Im happy your here with me"
but the vet said she wasnt even supposed to live this long and the tumors will only get worse and even if we had done chemo, it would have only prolonged it.
friend told my girlfriend something,
she then broke up with me,
i dont know what to now because she and the ex friend where the only people that i had.
what should i do to try and regain my relationship because shes helped me through alot over our 2 years of dating
TLDR gf broke up with me bc something someone said and i want to regain relationship with my gf
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee bc shes a poc with tattoos and"fits the part" of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up bc I need to protect my staff but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex looooves kids.
She was playing captain save a hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman's situation with this girl's "crazy" baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in eachothers life.
it hasn't even been two months!!!
IM SO HURT.
SHE NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A LIFE WITH ME.
I KNEWWWWW she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, soon as he sawThat I was weeping, answer'd, "Come with me."
Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.
Ent'ring he led me with him on the boundsOf a great circle itself encirclign a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land with lava pyramids cover'd,With sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life Save for those imprison'd in it, who, though they surroundedUs, dar'd not approach for fear of master.
As mine ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, Cries, and explosions that made th' eternal airTremble, caus'd by slaughter, starvation, withering, and Grief felt by those multitudes, many and vast,Of men, women, and children.
Theyve grown out to the point they look kinda awkward and shes saying i should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something Id like better?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
SHE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME CLOTHES THAT FIT ME
IM DYINGGGG
SHES SO SUPPORTIVE AND NICEE OMGGG
So its 0:34 the first of January while posting this and my Sister (f14) just Ruined my New Year by Calling my Mum Fat and telling her shes a drinker when she Poured herself a glass of champagne, wich she only does on her Birthday on chrismas eve and on New year.
Now my Parents are pissed of, my grandparents are pissed off and my Sister thinks she was Funny.
The same thing happend on Chrismas eve and now the whole feeling of new year is gone and i hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sry for spelling
Screw INTJ’s.
Why they gotta be good at EVERYTHING?!
It was a MISTAKE getting the booster the day before new years.
I feel like absolute dog water.
literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and i almost cried🙏
im so happy bro.
shes so cool.
im gonna ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :)
also, happy nye/happy ny everyone!!
first of all, the satisfaction i get from saying i am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
a high i’ll never come off of.
second of all, customer comes in for the second time mad because i didnt do copies from a book because of copyright.
she goes "well i called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that".
and im like ?? ma’am its in our policy
idc what customer service says.
she keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes "make my copy"
like lol not when you act rude like that.
our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and shes such a cuddly, loving, little girl and i love her cuddles every night and in the morning
im just scared that she isnt gonna be like that after she gets fixed?
am i over thinking it?
do you think since shes in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she'll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I domt fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently shes been asking me if i'll fart infront of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and its weirf shes never heard me do it.
I can't believe she saying im depressed looking while shes so shy girl and weird thinking she's not,
so delusional
i hate it,but they are mine only friends,
she calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to d2 after several year, now I’m windering:
Where do you guys sell/buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game "O xxx N yyy" and hope for the best?
Or are there a website that’s more efficient?
Mine friends are mean and delusional,
one is immiture and shy and always pulling me down,
other is fine just jealous and its getting on my nerves,
what to do?
This is a set up I can live with.
My bf and my's fear however is in a few years when we're ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own bf.
I'm very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow anymore pushing of the boundries.
What do I do here?
Boundry Issues w/ my boyfriends alter
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was upfront when we met and said shes sh** at texting, and has apologies when we were speaking for slow replies, something which I said don’t worry, I know your busy!
Convo seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation,
however I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread) but she’s viewed my story & posted a story since,
it was NYE.
So i was all ready for the new year actually thinking positive and the changes im going to make etc
then i see hes posted a picture of them both that shes took saying 'love of my life'.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face
Exes bf posted a pic of them :(
Everytime i ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even tho shes older wtf) and that i shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her,
she drains the life out of me,
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently ive been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, i could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brang herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great
im sooooo happy.
On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat.
I look on it again i see jane but this time i can look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So i just got my first beardie.
Hes only a moth old and like most new owners im worried about if hes or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day but so far ive only been able to feed about 6-7 crickets .
Ive tried feeding him some vegies too but the guy doesnt show any interest in them.
Is there anything Im doing wrong or is he just fine and im overly worried.
Then I foundout about this really cool website called Complex.
Theyre sort of like journalism but better since theyre all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through complex.
before I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic but travis scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
now i like tame impala and ive started dressing weirder, i bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully ill wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromitise himself/herself on social media?
is it just me cringing at the twitter posts by albatross?
everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
hes making it seem like xvg is a sinking ship atm and its doing fine.
soo i have this friend IRL.
man the dude is known everywhere.
hes got a solid rep in the streets, in the jails, everywhere this guy goes everyone knows him.
he was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on reddit because i feel like i'm not really known.
how do you get hella karma?
Im 21 hes about to be 23,
my issue is that he seens to have no ambition anymore,
he doesnt work and doesnt make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an emt,
he failed it the first time by 2 points and I think he fears failure that he doesnt really want to try anything anymore.
Hes been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
Ive gotten super smough about 5 times but i always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear im far enough away but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
Im using 2H battle axe +10gargoyle helm and naked (even with tattered armor it doesnt seem to make a difference)Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know throwing myself at them enough times ill get them but its slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do but i seem to always get caught in a dumb combo or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or noticed the letter I put in there, annnd now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you, you read this sentence wrong too?
*WELL NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION*
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :^)
19/F Aww shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time
If I just wana make draven my 1 carry how should i do it.
I know hes a good unit but what items can turn him into a god.
I tried heali g sword n rfc but i get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character
however his shield is gun is op and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets thats fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate because it got absorbed.
Idk about other players oppinions but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so hes not op evough to counter everything.
Tell me what you ppl think
I didn't think anything of it so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him the EK started screaming "MOOOOOMMYYYYYY HE STOOOOLE MY COOOOOOKIES!!!"
At first I was startled
i started to get nervous and i froze.
Then EP walks up and starts yelling "GIVE THOSE COOKIES FROM MY DAUGHTER GIVE THEM BACK!!"
And I did not know what to say at first but then something came so mind just say " but I didnt."
But the way I said was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That's when my dad noticed (hes old sad he didn't realise a little bit ealier)
he called a manager to the seen and the manager told us to continue and he'll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We're both xxx majors (I'm a dual xxx and yyy major while she's a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn't say I'm smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I'm a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off.
I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences.
I looked over my bank stanments and there is was.
My NEW prim bill.
I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport.
They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.
The next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me.
We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed.
Both dated added up to what i had told her before.
She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tmrw im no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach put all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance and he messaged me on friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said i didnt change anything.
After that part of the convo ended i asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
he said that hes good when he doesnt think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him etc.
Day 1 of no contant starts tmrw.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster
we used my name and ill credit his Instagram below
hes a good guy
im glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and or story
would you guys like either home made lore or not?
i could=t post this on the fallout Reddit for some reason,
wouldn't let me put the photo
hope its good guys!
is it even possible for itsoktocry to blow up outside of the 3 songs hes had do extremly well?
Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for awhile and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much i despises griefers because they dont just destroy something in a game they destroy HOURS of work and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying im mean if i dont go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non stop how im 'mean' or a 'bad person' because im busy doing something so i cant go give him his shit.
Well I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I dont see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy,
we do get slightly tipsy ya know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a fb message saying hes ready for her to leave (she'd been there 2 hrs at this point) and then he starts passive aggressive cleaning in front of us.
Hes going through a divorce so he keeps telling me thats taking all his money.
I didnt give him a title as I didnt even get one when i bought it.
It was salvage from some guys as a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale but I've long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do y'all think its not worth it?
Also if I did want to how would i?
So I just told this guy in my class who was also weird af and gave it to him saying oof I sat on jt it broke do u just want it.
Hes like no ew.
I have ocd and immediately got ashamed and was like lol whys it gross
it's the same as a whole one and along that line like lol why and he was like ok oof it's not and I'm like lol why did you say that.
I was saying it jokingly but I'm afraid I looked weird
like wtf
whys she upset or playfully upset that I dont want it.
My hooman staff cooms home tastin of sos ages and cheez.
I think she has anovver fluff she is makin treets for.
Shud I bee sad or anger?
Wat duz yur hooman taste of wen they coom home?

anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday i finally mustered up the courage to message him.
me: hey how's everything
him: it's been time
me: sorry abt last year,
i was super awkward around you lol
him: lol nah dwai
*DRUM ROLL PLEAAE*
me: tbh i liked you blah blah blah
him: haha you could've just told me!
next time you see me just say hi.
do you still go to (school)?
I'm not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn't sit well with me.
Hey gyz just wanted to share this helpful app with you all :D .
Its not tht i am trying to promote this app or something,
it really helped me a lot
thts why thought it might evn help u gyz out .
I 've seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team ovr's and many are thinking to buy players but cant decide which will boost their team ovr's the most .
This app helps to calculate the ovr of ur team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people(f2p players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team ovr since it will result in a huge loss of coins(coz of 10% EA tax).
Whats the wecommended amount of wedicated wam i shud have to servur?
IF u r readin this, u shud b ashamed ov yurself,
u shud b sleep,
go 2 bed i say

Just small info, I'm 5'9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k but I really can't hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical "u shud be good but ur not so im gunna giveu unrealistIC GOals", or should i be at 1:49?

This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Arent u all tired of seeing atleast the first two jumping into battle and wiping out ur whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying if they werent here then well the game would be balanced,
well i beg to differ cos theres akai with his insane disruption and diggie with his timely ulti or maybe even irithel might be banned cos of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly the king and queen of this game is lancelot and his beloved fanny.
Yoo know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O desidez to go to gym to do kwik workout, whatever dat iz.
She sez to me, "Yoo leave steak alone, doggo. Yoo be gud gurl!"
She tied plastik bag reel tite around steak.
Hahahaha!
Then she goes into gym and when she comez bak many furevers later, GUESS WHAT??
Hahahaha!
She open tiny car and look at me and look at steak bag....and she say, "GUD GURL!!!
Yoo leeve steak alone!"
And dat is da storee of me bein' gud gurl.
Mom-O sez she shud have brought steak into gym and left on bench next to her wiff her sweatshirt.
Sez she dum not to think of dat.
Mebbe Mom-O will git smart in a few furevers.
Now I obviously can't get out and shut it on the main road so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I've quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothings happened.
My bed smells like disease

Pls send me some tips n stuff on what to teach him.
Currently hes doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns because thats the only gun he gets kills from.

I recently had surgery and am not ment to lift too much or stretch but felt OK n thought I could do it alone .
I can't,
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of walls were I can't reach .
He said yes n today came to do it ,
after a bit said he was done and leaving,
I gave him £20 n said how greatful I am for the help .
Checked room once he left ...
both kids beds full of torn off we wallpaper , draws cracked where he stood on ,
iv still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent last 45 min picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds ,
aita if I confront him about the mess or shud I let it go n not bother asking in future
my boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when i ask dumb questions (example, i didnt know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said "why is it hard….. just fill it"
so i tried to do it but i failed.
later he was like "babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?"
then when i do it myself and dont ask him he goes "why dont you ask me, i can teach you/help you" but i refrain from asking becuz he gets frustrated
The last couple calls had arguments as he got mad cuz I beat his ass in video games (even tho gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked abt him to lots of my irl friends and they all ask why I continue to be his friend and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only ppl who actively tries to interact w him online.
yeah Ik shoes don't match.
they match the graffiti tho !
I'm trying alot of different styles so lmk what I shud change
hat: sicko by Ian conner

what shud i do lol
I don't remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida there's a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100× longer than when it's not making a sound.
I'd describe it as that trademark dessert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff , and … it’s just dude wt… heck it’s weird ,
so maybe it’s BOTH sort of a paradox (life is) but I just wanna know Hinestly did anyone else feel it ?
I want a logical explanation Plz , n if one don’t exist well I mean cuz loooong before … I was "of age" so to speak … for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate cuz I don’t drink but I’ve … hmm I’m an adult let’s put it like that
there’s other stjfff out there but Long before thag me and myFamily saw a UFO
even mg step dad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall n like … it doesn’t really scare me cuz I think it’s the way life is
things change
they don’t always have to make sense , and others say that 2.

I reside in Hyderabad,India, currently pursuing my bachelors in computer science .
I am a candian citizen but,for enrollment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam .
Now,the doubt that has arose is...wud my admission be considered international or domestic?..
On a side note,how hard is it to be admitted to UoT's computer science program.
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
Wud preffer a hardcore clan with a plan. With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal / target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It's not a necessity but it would be nice.

Hi,I was wondering wheter or not it worths to drop some money on pets.
Like I saw how much some ppl can spend on them to get good results (like t4), and I wouldnt want to spend that much :D.
Currently I have 5 t1 pets, and I wouldnt mind to see some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping "just" 100$ would worth it.
Does it worth to drop 100$ on pets?
towards the end of senior year and tht summer idk what happened but i got a hot bod n my face was all "girl u been through some shit have a gift" so now im pretty?
I jus made a post on a diff sub about having a nice date today, which is nice, but i am vv hesitant on making frens n stuff cuz of the last two years.
so like, after my glow up or whatever more ppl started talkin to me ya?
n a lot of boys did too!
i never rlly had v many frens so this was a huge yay!
the first boy i hung out with was rlly nice but then we got high and i did vv regrettable things i do not like.
Well tht boy was super haps n told lots of boys.
I dont want to jinx it and call them out by name but im talking with a company and im hoping it works out!
Im excited about all things ill be able to do with these free promo products to help other ppl and possibly get them off some or all of their rx drugs!
Im excited for myself because i have a bunch of medical issues that i do not use rx drugs for and the other stuff i buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others and it will help this company as well.
Im ready, im ready!
Im hella excited!
Might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do - plants now waaay small for its age imo and started to grow pistils
- should I chop n restart or ???
Will be posting more here once I get...comfortable again.
(Self love is impt!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through ~ will get to them when I can :3
In the meantime, happy new year!!
ps: I don’t have a SC & don’t take any $$$, I just like to.. show off, y’know closet slut things :) lol
Ttyl y’all
He said "shhh just kis me you fool".
I still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said "No. You're f***ed up now.
Whats going on?"
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says "good lord wtf happened.
I gotta garden
ttyl".
He read my reply which said "I'm so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated".
I just don't know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him, but I don't want to be held in limbo.
I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know when ever I say ttyl or gn or whatever I wanna add an ily. Just casually. To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten fold.
I know sometimes I day dream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
Makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
Tbh I kinda hope it is bc I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof is it hitting me hard.
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I(will takes days or a week to respond) but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to atm.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick ttyl either tbh.
Finally they seem to want to engage w/ me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then day of.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on and it’s not like we’re really talking so I just block them.
Idk, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival,
I'm still "Ocean Serene" but maybe I'm .. idk that's a tough thing to say, I never thought that my gf was just a random,
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said allot of things, I'm gonna agree that if I change the world changes,
the advice you get, it's allways iffy,
I want to speak for everyone but at the same time I can only speak for myself,
also I went to get some rum and coke,
I got coke and a few other people seen it so they bought some coke.. erm, I hope my friends are ok (that's all you weirdos I'm talking about)
random story I know,
tbh I'm not ok, but I'm surviving like usual,
actually I'm all just a bit Right and fine.
Ttyl
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, its 8 hrs to [redacted]. 7 to [redacted].
not a big deal
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles an hour drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] i spose [redacted] or [redacted]'s wife ratted me out.
maybe i should block them too
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you and we can see how well that went.
[me] shiiiiiiiiit. betrayal
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self gratification.
I was in a toxic rs for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our rs we were great.
One day both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
Im going to admit that sometimes when i feel jealous i just want her to reassure me like how i reassure her that its all good but she will only reassure me once and then said bye or ttyl.
Most of the time in an argument its always my fault,
she wont admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight wont continue anymore
And I said "But yeah yeah you right."
And he said "Ye well I gtg. Im doing something" and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the convo started.
But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped.
Like what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doenst like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that.
If he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.
Idk what else to put Besides that i hate the current circumstance of life i live in
im gonna give a little insight tomorrow
Ok i lied
i have to reveal my age tomorrow because if i dont Itll mess up the story
Um Idk what to type so ill type a worry i have
Umm i dont think ill get the tapegun intime
Ok bye ttyl everyone
she said something like "but i want to make sure that we go as a friend?" thing and i was like "okay, i know" and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said "ofc i like my long time bf"
yea, whatever right haha
and here's my question...
yesterday when i was at work, she msg me saying something like "how's your work doing" and i kinda reply her with cold tone saying "i'm at work ttyl" and then she kinda upset :" Okay, i mean i understand you are at work so busy but u didn’t cut me off like this before so i kinda get it that you dont want to talk anymore like before.
got it!
bye!
How do you get destiny delicacies
I've seen a few ppl have them but I've never got one
idek where you get them
if anyone knows it would be alot of help☺
and my machine f!@#ing freezes up
it's been happening for like 2 days now...
this machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3d scanner but 4 browser tabs on reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% OF MY DAMN MEMORY AND 60% of my cpu power and freezes the wholedamn thing up.
HEY! WAIT!
i've got a new complaint! ..... Seriously WTF are you devs doing???
stahp plz
If you think it's rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying "gotta go I'll talk to you later" then it's also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one off,
things happen,
maybe something came up and you got distracted etc.
But EVERY SINGLE PERSON ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It's really not that hard to just say "gotta go, i'll text you later" or "so and so just got home, TTYL"
Even just "bye" or "BRB" or something!
Today i got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if i did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn't wanna ignore them just to talk to me,
i said it wouldn't be a problem if he had just said something like "i can't talk rn" or "im with my friends ttyl" or just literally anything.
He then said i was overthink stuf and i should " chill out" so i left it at that.
So AITA and over thinking things?
AITA for gerring mad at my bf after he ignored me for a few days
So I would usually post this on r/keto but that sub is soooooo intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But like, a girl’s gotta rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
Have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like "bitch, CALORIES PUHLEAZE"
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their no cheat days mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten free dairy free carb dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
Afaik, the concept of mini album is only around in kpop (maybe jpop?)
Im always dissapointed when a long awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5 songs album.
I can tolerate debut album since you really dont have a lot of material, but if youre snsd or something and you come out with mini after years long hiatus like mr mr, its kinda insulting.
idk what to say lol
i'm pretty funny not only bc i manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often but also because i'm just fuckin hilarious tbh
i'm from yorkshire and that probably makes me cooler than you bc the north is just superior and i'm ready to die on this hill but ig we can be mates
i would really like some of those
ok i'm running out of people to laugh at my jokes
17m from the uk,
pls be able to hold a conversation lol
Idek what kind of dog this was but it was so ugly
my god who would own such a thing.
Dogs with wrinkles like pugs, char pays(idk how to spell it), bulldogs, boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all, I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally be told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness/ over nose-can’t breathe)
and yes I know I’m gonna get shit on my all the fuckin neck beards on reddit that just ADORE their snot nose little pug,
idec
I’m so tired of people and they’re dogs.
Everytime i listen to him sht makes so much sense, even tho i dont know what he is talking about,
that leads me to belive that either that guy is a genius who can articulate whats going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something?
I mean what should i listen to if i rly wanna find out the truth if schiff is just "bias to Gold" and thats the reason why he is so hard on the current economy etc.
Do boobs=nice, coz idk never seen em before
then he check the oil level saying that the oil also smell like gasoline that gasoline and oil is mixing up together
open one spark plug see the massive leak in there literally full up
"let me say oil" smell like gasoline
I didn’t smell that one
that’s what the worker told me
then he call his boss and the boss say is not gasoline is just oil "that shit smell like gasoline 🤦🏾‍♂️
even the worker confirm that I ain’t crazy but ayyy maybe I am
and his worker" Told me he going to sealed the black thing that goes in top of the spark plug that covers it
"sorry my English not that amazing"
he said he was putting a sealed after draining the oil as he mentioned
is oil drained the oil sealed the thing so oil don’t drip out of it and don’t drip to the floor
but didn’t help me find the cause of why is oil getting into the spark plug because a sealed on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️
telling me if the problem keeps on is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way to much oil and is causing the oil leak that if the problems persist I will have to remove it
Sorry for the long paragraph but need advices,
need help tbh
My rabbit didn't eat or drink so I went to check him,
its been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food idk.
(He has constipation so Imma check does he poop.)
How do I sleep if i have to check out my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is gonna become chaotic lol.
i assume the time has already passed for this but idk i figured i may as well ask,
i kinda forgot i even had those tix until they announced they'd be touring again today
Now, my aunts (gma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated gma both before and after she passed.
When my gma first started getting sick, sis wasn’t the best bc she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but gma was also scared of covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job i couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back & forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
WIBTA if i didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So i mett this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dateing.
Last night everything was all right she was happy said good night anda ily like every night.
And the next morning when i texted her good morning she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad af all day because of me and but diden't want to say why.
Idk what i did.
I did nothing.
What should i do.
How can i contact her.
Should i give her space?
My gf blocked me and idk why
Mines ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in witch I have a F,
this is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I've done but are nowhere in the books,
this kinda snuck up on me cause I thought they were done and filed only to check my grades and find out they weren't.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you at going say "ikr I only have a 89, why couldn't she round up, fml)
Imma be honest that's not very helpful rn
so first off bard top
what a pick ikr.
lets drop down my main build cause its the best assasin play style i like.
* my core is static/ie/RFC.
now i tried many ways and this is the best way
i like to safely clear and lay out poke.
now under certain occasions like vs a garen id go what many would call shot gun bard swaping out static for runnans and if needed Rfc for pd.
giving some more tank..
now as for the other two i actually leave them more optional picks in the ap department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain
id pick up hextech gunblade
this item is phenomenal on bard on hits are great.
if your already carrying hard id go something like lyiandries cause with the lead no one will catch you with this and the chunk is just bardo crazzzzyyyy.
yet two try gunblade and lyandries together but someday.
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years; we're both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It's driving me crazy, how to deal?
This wouldn’t be an issue if y’all servers ask in the beginning do u guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.
Also why restaurants have to be set up like that
why u can’t just get up to the cashier and pay ur fucking share or food.
Hey guys bard main,
just join reddit after finding out there are other off metta bards!
So i main him top,
yes its scary but i do.
So i been getting alot questions about my builds from friends and happy on lookers lately!
thought i share my builds!
Im 16 years old 5'9.
Im new to basketball and id like to ask for drills i can do by myself so i can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I dont have a decent shot nor a decent handle,
i could barely reach the backboard plus i have no friends so dont even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why i wanted to be good at it so bad is because i just want people to know me as somebody cuz right now im a nobody,
i want to be SOMEBODY.
PS. Ive never played an actual basketball ever in my life.. ikr?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising ykno) but p chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when i want to be), goofy, a lil chaotic, big overthinker kinda deal.
Enneagram type 4 bc apparently that matters (jk !!!)
Honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love ... you get the gist :)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist so a program with med school prerequisites would be preferable,
plus, I plan to take my med school abroad (wow big dreams much?
I doubt I'd get in but it wouldn't hurt to try tho).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me,
I'd be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh and location too.
I'm short so if my classes are ~far~ I might as well roller skate my way through campus jk jk.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, ya know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would've prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do
the player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now but I dont know if I want to pursue her
its complicated.
Right now its summer break so imma wait til school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person cuz they dont talk to me online lol.
I dont know how long this series will go but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I dont know how long this is gonna take but probably quite awhile.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I dont have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say, that if youre a kid, like an elementary school kid and youre here, where the fuck are your parents???
Lol nvm fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Cause I got them and no one to give them too lmao jk unless..........
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium sprite and a mcdouble?
So idk why o got on everyone nerves about the separate checks....

I dont expect to get any messages but hey its worth a try.
Ps. I dont know how to write these properly so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format omo
Oh and if I dont reply soon it might mean Im asleep or playing DnD hehe.

Well I'm going to see if I can buy some stuff off steam now...
let's hope there's still some good sales
Okay so I was a totl noob and earesed my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was gonna use but I sent monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
or how do you open the .key file
edit: nvm I'm a complete noob
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive monero wallet seeds with .keyfile?

So i can guess ur gender based on ur post history
Nvm..lemmee guess ur gender instead
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the prof is Oct.18.
*(edit. nvm, this part isn't true pls disregard).*
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is Feb.9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the prof that I'm dropping the course,
do I also have to get permission?
I'm planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits btw.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I rlly wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like "what!?" reallyyy loudddly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say "nvm" cuz I felt like I was in the mf spotlight.
But every time, my nmom says that can't be true because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
"It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?"
Umm idk, maybe its bc we're DIFFERENT PEOPLE with DIFFERENT BODIES???
Tbh, have anyone ever experience fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn't die and manage to kill aleast one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch BUT rampage didn't pop his ult yet.
😲Wtf?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky af fighter, and a carry that solo everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1
When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.
I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, always. Possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in....
oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
like now I feel guilty for smiling.
nvm the fake ones ish, but fuck.
haha. ugh.
why am I still alive.
lol why tf does smiling hurt
Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME.
i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE.
HE SAYS "WHATS UP" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER.
I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS.
AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD.
IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING.
BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD.
I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS,
THEN I LOOK BACK UP.
PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS.
Edit: yes I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen. Useful, I know.
But URGHHHH. They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
Btw there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: nvm. I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance, oops now I'm not getting any mp!
Try to type in chat, "I will not cheat on this game!"
message repeats every time I hit enter.
WTF
im not cheating.
anyways I type those words into the chat ( "I will not cheat on this game!") and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Wort way to tell a player to turn off Adblock but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player
10/10 never play again
EDIT: nvm, anytime I type in the chat the same shit happens
I'm gonna skip the oscar-bait shit like The Post because there's only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Dems making movies about how (Extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) "politics used to be moooorrreeee poollliitte we neeeeed a return to The Discouuurrrse."
I'm sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.
2mo ago I bought a cheap '95 nissan truck,
I was only locally driving so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn't put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd **only** when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can't rev it past 3k in my driveway w/o feeling like I'm going to break something,
I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it,
it'll hit close-to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule-out what could be causing this power-sap, IE is it the air/fuel or a clogged cat/exhaust/etc or something entirely different?
I ruled-out 'different', I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in Neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone elses nmom treat you like you're overreacting about your period pains?
Hey! Read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangeroes,
is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2mo boston terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside
friends think she said that cuz she was w her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up etc.
others think its a way for her to be evil, like think of me cuz im never coming to get that charm.
i think its some type of hoover, good or bad.
any insight is appreciated.
if your a woman please tell me your perspective.
so confused, bt she is clearly w someone else and why she couldnt call me back and why she didnt respond to my txt msgs.
she couldve said im w my bf please dont call me bt she didnt.
Just a side note: my bf and i are buying a house.
we will be moving out in 2mo.
Once the papers are all finalzed.
I have an Australian shepherd 9mo.
My bf (24m) and i (25f) got her at 3 mo.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with a black lab and a dog small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a rat terrier.
Thier play style is boxing.
And one of my roomates (25m) has a beagle.
He doesnt like to play much
infact he seems kinda scared too.
i know all of these things about my dog.
i know that it doesn't matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise; doesn't matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business;
what matters is that my dog is nervous
-- so when i hold my hand out and tell you, no, he's not sitting or lying down because he's calmly waiting for you to say hi, it's because he's nervous and insecure, i DON'T mean it as a joke, and it's NOT an invitation for you to say, "AW WELL MY DOG/CHILD IS VERY FRIENDLY SO LET ME APPROACH!"
i don't care if your dog/child is friendly or "dog savvy".
i don't care if your dog "is just a puppy"
(why the hell is that even relevant?
is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies? ??????).
i don't care if your child is capable of not screeching "OMG A PUPPYYYYYYY".
can you, y'know, DO something about your child? and also your dog?
But with less than 3mo to go for that i feel I'm not ready yet but having never taken it I have nothing to compare it to besides collegues advice.
Without knowing what I know they can't know if I'm actually ready yet but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this...bad...amd it would be awesome to be done 6 mo from my intro exam.
I'm close... I just don't know if I'm 2mo study close.
Somm certified advice
(M/5'10"/26/165-195lbs) 2mo progress, gaining too much weight?
Passed my faa ppl written!!!
I know this sounds weird but heres my issue,
about 4 months ago i had an 3700X which died after start crashing when i tried to play games and a day later not booting,
send to rma, they confirmed the cpu was dead and gave my money back after 2mo,
after that i got an 3800X,
as soon as i tried got the boot code 7b everything power up but no reboots or video signal,
send to rma this time with the store
after 1mo they confirmed the cpu was falty send me a new one,
i got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom(T) has always been the type where her feelings matter 1st + only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone elses fault entirely.
Ex: I needed some1 to babysit our then 2mo for 3-4 hrs.
Dads work had som1 who had COVID,
we opted out of them watching our son + askd my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her *before* I set it all up b/c I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its *my fault* \+ she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her *days* after the incident b/c she didnt call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing,
T promptly got off the phone,
I nvr got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to Ts narcissism.
I dont expect an apology from T b/c she **nvr** has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
WIBTA for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5mo, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2mo he's co-sleot with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I've been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get 2mo baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (Currently replacing pacifier every hour)
FTM to a sweet 2 month old girl and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
FTM struggling with sleeps
So i already have an orange golden chinchilla ( toto - 2mo old) and we have had toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got terri (2 mo himalayan ragdoll) too keep eachother company.
Its only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor?
just always goin "bRRrrRRrrRRrr".
Im not sure if she has a blocked nose because toto, never made this kind of sound....
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
Can’t play till 2moro but wyd like to know so I can make money hunting or robbingeverything and everyone
How much do pelts sell for online???
Alright y’all. I think I mis-tagged this earlier so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily w a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, & lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, **I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running** (I have no issue w being over 12+ ft from other ppl / usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually im quietly confident goin into these games but with injuries, players missing etc, im kinda happy if we get a draw.
I know they're utter pish and paper wise we should be wiping the floor with them but just not feelin the 2/3 nil vibe atm!
Anyone wanna talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
this is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait nvm shit meme.
i was 6 and playing lego rockband,
i decided to ask for the buddy holly pack.
my parents(despite being in theyre 40s) said "how the shit do you know that"
i never realised that my parents got into weezer.
so thats how i got into weezer
I genually don't understand how "toxic" behavior is more pusished than literally int or troll.
Well I've had an account which always recieved those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until i got in a bad streak of losses in ranked and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior.... And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in game chat for toxic behvaiour after a report doesn't understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait till the morning but then I said nvm I just realized it’s almost 2
I’ll just wait
and then he asked what would happen if I ate it rn and I said nothing
it’s just too late

so inspiring but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :(
Before I realized it was 2

I know your skin isn't perfect or you're insecure about your nose or looks.
but those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You're beautiful because you're YOU
Rant over

God. why did you give me this huge ass nose.
i'm too ugly to even rant on snapchat so i do it on reddit instead
ok it's over nowhopefully
Can I get a rip in the chat boys,
I was trying to go to sleep bc I couldn’t when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says bc she only said my name in all caps and then an nvm.
Fuck.
I just realized im complaining over a 5 minute fix..
Had never heard of this "influencer" before and consider myself pretty internet saavy.
I then lost interest in her bc her IG wasn't that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out and then I took a great interest in checking in on her bc I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while:
How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her $$ bc she claims to not being able to afford food or rent or whatever when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers which aren't cheap.
I don't like him or anything but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my bf with him.
I wouldn't do that to him ofc but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?

That's like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying "ahh nvm I want to eat somewhere else" as soon as they're bringing the food out.
I played a game as rengar and i was 6/2 and got solo killed by anvia who didnt have roa or tear finished yet
i looked over at the replay 100 times and all i can think to my self is if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did the anvia will win cna
some one plz explain WHY THE FUCK AN ANIVIA IS STRONGER THEN A RENGAR IN A 1V1 WHEN THE RENGAR HAS A GOLD LEAD?
actual nvm dont care
just quting this brain dead game
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage & both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds & says "NVM" so I just gave her mines & went on with my day.

If there's a ghost in the house, why the HELL would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a lil too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they're screwed.
4. The f**k you splitting up for?!
There's always this one guy in horror movies that's like: Guys, there's a crazy a** killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed!
That's EXACTLY what the killer WANTS!
basically I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again cuz my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her) and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this reddit has been is "true_warrior is a bad person, oh nvm hes good" and "p90 is broken im quitting the game".
lol nvm I'm still here in can't sleep

Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise,what with having an storyline that doesn come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as Over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and neccesary amount of seriousness and comedy,
the characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert,Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events dont always have to rely on Neptune presence.
Gr8 b8, m8. I rel8, str8 appreci8, and congratul8.

ive taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take NO MORE.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: meh, ok, thats fine.
They then use shit like A sub 1 through A sub 20 for variables.
infact, i have a linear algebra book that did this... A's FOR EVERYTHING.
the pages were just matrices filled with A's.
JUST DRAW A WEIRD SHAPE OR SOMETHING- ANYTHING BUT THAT ISH!
Scariest thing 3ver m8
Well,well here we are again frustrated, angry in front of my phone
what a neat way to start isnt it?
All of ya readers are my theraphie and i dont ow you a cent

If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all cause of your short attention span so lets keep it short(what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying "keep it short im a genius ain't i?")
Well a tryed explaining to my budds that porn is kinda shaby and yeah just bad and u know who listened.......
Hey,I just want to know what games can I run on this PC and witch nota.
I was a spy and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, mafia and sk had made their kills.
I proudly said: "I was attacked while in jail!",
wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and ask me "You were attacked while you were in jail?" and I answer "yes m8".
He then tells me that what I am saying is bs because sk and maf have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously!?
Like I don't rly care what mean shit ppl on the internet say.
But when i got nobody IRL all I have is the internet and it do kinda hurt a bit when i just want to vent my problems.
And I'd be fine if it got maybe a single upv*te and no comments and I'd be fine.
But instead, it's full of people saying
Oh boi u 2 dum for da movie boi,
da director wuz like shieeet itz bout da hiden meaningz u have 2 find boi, lyke u kno it duznt spoonfeed ya da film ya kno?
Like shieet y it gotta explain m8,
just imagine what happened ya know?
It's no like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has ya kno?
yet when fully charged for the 1st 30-60 minutes, it's always on!
which is beaaaautiful!
Lastly, if i do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping) the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off?
wtf m8?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone? or is it just me?
in searching google i cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues i am really enjoying the mod.
its just a fuckin' ball ache every single time i want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before i can puff...
Everytime i log on i want to chill afk nmz and play xbox and be fat right but, lately i log on play rs afk for like 20secs and i get logged out and its fucking annoying
is it my Internet connection or is it the servers or what
its pissin me off m8
Next we have my Stats class and I didn't realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework and so my grade was a 70 something and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my Band class is basically easy A as it's show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert and so I passed that gg ez m8.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do NOT go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like "wtf m8?" and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there,
did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This years rookie game is actually going to be real exciting,

I don't like when ppl mumble on the phone or if they ramble on and it's all about then.
But now it just doesnt make sence, you only get 1 ticket per match and if you are lucky you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the 1 thing F2p was always abble to do because of the low cost of entrence and the rewards where good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you didnt like him. Use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you dont like the new WT than dont play it.
Closed tech support?
It's 1:30am and you're a billion-dollar, global enterprise.

So long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall 22 semester and i’m on the waitlist since April.

My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No. Fking. Competition.
Most men this day are thirsty af.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs.
And i mean that literally.
BUT – thats good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24) M an accountant at a traveling company
we ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today i called one of our agents and a girl picked up
she was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts and she said yes i will be at your company at 2100
i said ok, and at 2100 she came by and asked who is the accountant
i said i am please follow me to the room,
she came and i asked her how much did she bring
she said i have $1300 with me , which will not cover all of their debts btw, so i brought a reciept and write down the amount and the company name and the i asked her for her name

Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that,
she probably already have one also.
A real digital movie camera cost sooo damn much.
So I opted for an analogic one.
Now, 8mm/super have an affordable price, 16mm don't cost much, and 35mm cost A LOT so I think I'm going for a super 8.
But then how does it work?
Lol. I mean I buy her a super 8 but I should also buy her a videorecorder, and some VHS.. things like that,
Idk how it work.
Pls can someone explain to me what should I do

Hi guys, this year was my third year at glasto and I loved it sooo much and hope u guys did too !
Maybe a lil earlier idk cause I'm usually at work but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mbs range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more ppl are at home I'm gonna see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60.
I am an aspiring doctor/med student and so seeing alot of med related subjects as early in our first sem I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!!
I passed for UPLB BS Bio!
Tbh thooo this wasn't my priority program, so ofc I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be an iska but I was also worried bcos I'm not rlly as interested in Bio as invested I already was in PT.
Sure I could learn to love bio, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year but that's not certain.

We cannae dae that (not YET at least…)
You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.

So I will be starting a job next week and desperatly need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
Looking for single bedroom flats or flatshares is a legit issue as 3 letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
VACUUM WONT STOP SUCKING PLEASE SEND HELP, IS IT GONNA BLOW?
Basically if you didn’t know what that is,it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says "Lets eat granny" making it seem like someone’s gonna eat their nan.
However,the other example says "Lets eat,granny" implying a different meaning to the sentence.
Pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas ig.
I literally couldn't have been more at fault
just drove straight into this woman's golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it)
she seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it's my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers aswell just very minor body work/paint maybe a small dent.
what boardband do i get?
ive had virgin for 8 years and holy shit is it slow for 40£ monthly.

lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn't actually laugh
LOL - adults and people who don't really know how the internet works use this
Lol - not sure why this came up but it's likely an autocorrect but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named
LoL - grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
also confusing because of league of legends.
looooooooool - now, i think my gf pronounces this but she says that this one would rhyme with "spool" but i think it's the drawn out "o".
So yeah, i think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn't exist.
lollllllllllllll - when i hear her say "loooool", this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it. but i still think that's "loooooool",
you can't repeatedly pronounce a consonant
So, when is big Ben going to bong again?

But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Prefferably under £50!
Also does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming. (Don't require me to stand for legnths of time)
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what i do i literally can't keep the dust at bay for more than 24hrs and i am losing my mind.
It's 10pm, 28c, and my bum is literally melting.

To the neighbor that wejt out of their way just to check on me I appreciate that
I just wanted to say from one gen Z to millennials, good on you guys.
I hope you find what you're looking for. It's been fun being ur little buddies in life.
If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really tbh
Rmember, theres alot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that dosing experience alot of positive moments this sub does make me smile :)
Damn some ppl need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet geez
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kinda a lot lol), so I would reaaaaally appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I see the need bc who the fuck cares.
But now it seems that y'all done made grits without the butter and made us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were fixin to tour more plantations than Carter's got little pills but you done gone and brought up them "slave owners" now.
Ain't amountin to nothin more than a hill of beans!

All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
Y'all get along now, ya hear?
How to go from # to date?
How do I break of a relationship with my 'friend'?
basically I put my skate account in my Instagram bio cuz I have no posts on my main and I’m kinda insecure abt my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless and ppl won’t expect me to be like shredded or sum shit if they add me) and today I got like 3 followers (girls from dif towns who don’t know me).
im really picky tho bc I don’t wanna have a relationship unless I actually feel like I’d really fuck w the person and be into them a lot so I didn’t follow any of them back.
bro ive gotten added and unadded on ig so many times today that it’s kinda a confidence boost lmao
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from ppl who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers smh..
Nothing else to say, come at me salty ppl lmao

tldr: the title
Other vegans that youre friends w tell you that they dont tell other ppl theyre vegan?
Like the purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community cause those are probably the ppl that would be more gentle w their words, which is what some ppl need in order to listen.
Im a very straightforward, no sugar coating typa person, and although some ppl appreciate it, a lot more get upset & start trying to put words in my mouth &twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like 300€ worth of fake internet points, like wtf are you doing honestly LOL
Why would you give awards to ppl lol
i just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre googling and confirmed the time that ill be there at.
If she gives any further resistance I think ill just next her/ ignore/not respond / agree with her that she can't handle the place , or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first frikken date
Yes i agree things like tumblr made up identities are weird and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted calling ppl snowflakes is just weak
Give your self a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without ANY unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series! Props to you!
the New Year’s eve Raticate w hat.
haven’t found him anywhere yet.
anyone want to raid?
need a few ppl quick.
Stop.
I think what i am trying to say...this game is not hard.
Dont make it hard urself.
The main objective as i understood is to get the dragon. And dont die till that.
Even beter if u outfarm ur oponent.
Just dont die.
And trades in lane...if u see enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights but he was out of town
so we couldn’t do that- and now he’s back in town and I asked him what he’s doing on New Years and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers form our work
and likeeeee he didn’t offer an invite and then he said if he cancels with them would I like to come over and I just said idk what I’m doing yet so I don’t know
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There’s gonna be ppl on the internet saying "stat padder" but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid

Just kind of realized that I’ve never had nye plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that ..
recently realized I still don’t have enough friends to have a one for my 21st coming up...
Idk why I didn’t clue into This tho.
Like I never thought about how ppl have traditions for this night, besides my sister who goes out to her friends every year.
It’s funny that covid isn’t affecting my Ny at all..
Anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight lol.
helo, im looking for ppl to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
just please be aware that im not very good at upholding conversations uwu f/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the "aaa" word, and I want to yank four words, *without* selecting the spaces after "ddd":> xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like i see vids on yt on it.
But like, i cant see any mention on the design notes etc.
Where do ppl get the info from?
Dm me to debate
pls be well learned in your belief.
I want dms bc Itll get deep and I cant reply to 300 ppl like that.
Also I need 500 characters so here come the blah blah
I m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl but I am saying that they wont like to do it bcoz they r humans with their own choices and not agreeing to be a girl isnt making them a women anti.
Like how many guys around you would be willing to turned into disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time [but how much time?]
and maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
but knowing this isn't making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they r asked to do all this.
I wont like it if you will try to make me a man and want me to dance in front of so many ppl eventhough I am a tomboy.
Anyone missing me?
If you miss a reddit friend, read this.
IT COULD BE pME!!
So I just hopped on PC from Ps4, not even 2.5k games played there,
played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a KB&M, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with ppl 2k kills and preds even,
yet I haven't even a hundred games played and about 80kills with all characters.
Not really having fun anymore,
can't improve if I get shit on every game
I see a lot of ppl on here who seem hella said, so if u hella sad I’m down to chat.
So yeah if u down for a chat, or long term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so
so i always see ppl talk about sending designs and edits to affinity but how do i do that??
ive worked at od for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it??
like not even the print sup.
we do every type of editing in store and i hate it.
like we’re out here doing stuff that im pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to affinity based on what i see on here.
but yeah is more of this info on the store portal or where can i learn more?
im extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last minute rude customers (:
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k and i was like-Hell Nawh That Not Worth 100k- like bruh- .-.
WhY dO pPl FiNd ThE NeW SeT ExPeNsIvE
Ik the girl I posted abt is a troll ppl- but oh well she got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down
It is the bar with the team comp and the status of each characters that is use to follow report team ( like in the actual world cup) .
It can be tweak down to not reveal to much info about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier and you won't have to use tab
HMU with a chat message,
tell me about yourself and we can go from there
I dont understand how ppl can build what they do...
i love building but i guess my creativity isnt well tuned as alotta ppls an it bothers me i cant build amazing stuff
i no i could if inhave the creative side uggh
i just tend to give up after awhile n settle for simple crap to pass for ok
I care abt how I effect ppl a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in convos w big groups of ppl which is related to adhd.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kinda stand offish to ppl idk.
I’ll try to act like idc if someone doesn’t like me but drunk ppl will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all r adhd things tho bc rsd
I’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent
I can have a really really really flirty personality at times.
I remember in hs my friends mom said I had the "personality " so I’d probably be the r first to have a boyfriend
but when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds HER accountable she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects any / everyone who doesn’t agree w her and screams about how she doesn’t care
or more specifically in her words "I don’t give a fuck"
she’ll NEVER take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite
all the things she screams @ ppl to NOT do to her she turns around and does the exact same rude petty shit to any/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts JUST like my mom and my mom can’t stand it / accept that
so she becomes down right nasty.
In class I’ve usually been really quiet but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click w in class and be reallyyyy really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen b feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk thought.
I’ve always been a smiley happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have adhd.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk which I heard ppl w adhd are both.
Could I be istp ?
Help type me pls
Idk if ppl would even want to
just wanna know if thats allowed, and if not where would be a good place to post that
(ive watched dragonmar and other ppls videos but that would be hard to be a me specific video on there)
like in a good way tho
Some ppl are just indescribable
I ain’t done this before but i’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like interests :)
we can definitely talk abt anime (especially romance imma sucker for it), we can talk abt games and go into detail abt lore and shtuff, creepy stories go hard, and really i’m just down for anything :)
i’m not gonna be weird so as long as you’re not weird
any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah if i didn’t do this right lmk :)
oh and i’ll absolutely talk more on snap
The part I'm humming is like "word word word wo-o-o-ord" x2.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like "fly-y-y-yyy."
I'm pretty sure it's a popular song, I've heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah tbh it is
i care abt a lot of ppl and i cant just... make people be happy.
But like.... i wanna :(
Just wanna make everybody i care about happy,
like is that too much to ask
I think that some ppl here are ai or something
smh don't even try
i can do that by myself🤠
Hey, F/19 , bored af ,
I enjoy talking to new ppl,
hmu?!
i started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90s.
she said everyone was watching wrestling back then and it was a cool thing.
now no one gives a shit😭 (i don’t rlly blame them sometimes).
i asked her "why do u think ppl stopped liking it" and she said "cause it’s garbage.
it’s come on fox on fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hit i change the channel"
i had to include that in there bc she’s so funny😂😂😂
anyways.
Hey, Cant fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting,
hmu if u think we could hit off well,
hope we have a great time ,future chat buddy ;)😁
kinda weird ngl
These mfs can outrun, out swim or out stam (through venom) anything that tries to get it.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
just finished the show so i’m a lil behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much lol.
also by sidestory i mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
My favorite Obama quote: "Michael and I also wanna uh, acknowledge, uh.....yy...y.yy..uuuhhh..yyy....your son Jack, who deployed today."
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc
Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best game ever that I play!
But have some probs..
I’d always heard of mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple months ago and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists rn.
Anyways that was just my thoughts, Happy new years everyone hope the new year treats u well.
Now for this one it's kinda hard because the enemies are SOOO COOL for this game, but...
If I had to choose, I'd say I like the Clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not THE only enemie in the game that doesn't have a single other Variation from what I remember.
Honestly I wasn't gonna make one but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I dsagree with a lot of others list, not to say my list is right bc this is all subjective anyway which Is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!YAYYYY
Imo lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind ive only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of ep 3)unlike her father lily tries to work with lee and for the most part the group she does what she has to she is a bit of a bitch cause she has to i only have 1 problem with lily she killed carly
if you could get ben to confess yes i got spoiled on that and a few other things ben is useless he is what looks like a collage student yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7
pls dont downvote me into oblivion if i missed something
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats so 4 isn't really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kinda sucks IMO.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who lived both as a woman and as a man (not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders) so thats kinda neat imo
I don't think he did the role justice.
I feel before neo figured it out the way he was speaking was ok, but after...IMO he should of went full Hugo weaving speech.
Just wanted to share my opinion not being a united fan, on the game against burnley.
(not that many of you will care).
Mctominay sheeeeesh what a guy.
Thought that shaw was solid, now youve got two good left backs in good form.
Also wanted to say awb had a muhc better game i thought.
AFter the shitty games and dalot playing well I personaly thought awb improved alot.
Hahaha.
OMG it's terribl-....yyy funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can ONLY drop at 4-6, yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues but for me I can live with those issues but not this, pls change
Kind of an odd question imo, but I have a bp who I just got to eat f/t for the first time (yay!!!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I've tried f/t large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
Could be a fluke though.
Ik it's like a meme or something of "dark souls player complains about the combat" or something similar, but I just don't get the combat.
I can do ds3 deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately, ik not a difficult game but hear me out rq if you know the game.
OMG!
WHY do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they dont have ANY idea of how a torrent even works (its so damn easy though!) comments like "The link doesnt work" Rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
Your just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So i get tipped on the app, gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the app after?Wtf is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was LESS than the app tip...
If your are tipping both, TIP BOTH.
Ngl tft is a good mode ,but its like hs a good game to play on your phone not something to grind out all day all night like wtf ? Its not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on prep up and alt tab until its next time u can do anyhing)
any thoughts?
i know its a scientific things and all but some of the post there is just too much.
learning dream languages???
wtf?
and some bloke is saying "i tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didnt lucid dream?!" every few hours.
maybe the post are just giving a litte too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like Dear lord wtf is happening ooooh
So I am I first time cup user and i got the saalt cup at target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold+17yovirgin=ow) I got in in w/the 7 fold and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how tf am i supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails.
In one way, it kind of helped me ~find~ the cup lowkey grip but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping I'm down to my last dollars soon and I can't just eat beer and cigarettes
then I set them down so I didn't have to carry them across the street to get beer (it's cheaper at Adventures First Stop)
then I walked back and forgot my groceries walked all the way home and ah shit, I'm getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill
I live on a hill.
down.
the middle, really.
i imagine it's like an amateur San Fran so I walked back and got them.
no crime round these parts.
not much, anyway.
Didn’t think about nails...
Is he gonna tell her?
If so how would that convo go down?!!!?
Okay wtf Arlo now knows sera ( idk how to spell her full name) is Johns weakness
First of all, we've seen they are greedy as f(OK, not as other mobile studios, but stiiiiiill) Second, game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high end phones) Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
Wtf are you yanks on
See also: (on an article about how it's "40 degrees in some parts of Europe") > wtf lol that's not hot at all put on a jakcet dummies ("[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16C") > zomg thats rly cold im never moving to canada
Someines it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me tf out and gives me nods similar to codiene, why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with wether or not a woman looks at me and thinks Im ugly, if that happens I get anxious From it, but ifva women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks im decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
WTF IS GOING ON
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisble, even if they don't detect you they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I shouldve just grabbed an smg and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many trys most of them being on his second phase, his 3rd phase I beat first time.
Only me guess its so broken?
I got 7 place on last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Becuz i have less than 3000 points.
(i need 55 magaki frags and i get 50, just feel my suffering)
Also in other event with gamer764 i have \~8000 points and got 4 place and got rewards for 4 place, not for 1, whats need 7k points or more.
Are the developers too greedy?
Hope the title makes sense - Have a list of names "john.baker" (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 colums "john" and "baker" Thanks!!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were goin to see each other and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday and so I canceled it and now she won't stop saying sorry that's not what she meant.
Wtf
do I do I told her I was going on another one next month(lie) to make her feel better but I didn't.
But, I don't neccesarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks
Okay so I've got less than a chapter left in GotM and I still can't understand wtf Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I'm missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots Yhall are whack
Wtf i posted a litteral anime foot and still didn't even make most controversial post of DAY. let alone all time
So huh you cant alpha karthus ult wtf is this bs?
It would be very helpful all of you OP's out there actually said wtf it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it! Such as "now I understand why this (brand name) thing has everyone going crazy"...
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn't mean much to me.
If it's too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever that the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the "DFW teams are cursed" camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me to much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential WTF transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a pc but in the mean time I use a crappy 13 year old pc I got money for rust bought it and it took 4 hours to download 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server after I hit a tree with my rock my game crashed at this time it was 12:47 am and I just said f**k it and went to bed ready for a hull lot of s**t today

GK pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.

GT:

She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot n cold.
Now shes onto another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind if disrespectful to the new bf huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd, however, i will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her but i cant think of a reason why i should…
After going "uhh no?" She sends me a picture of said candle holder.
From her kitchen.
I of course go "wtf you're home??" and turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So Im beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
Tldr
:
sickly nmom went into hospital for 3 days, I find out shes home because of a candle holder.
ts been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but
its really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is i let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message i sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful bc of a song i made that i was sharing.
I was very flirtatious maybe more so than i was with my gf when i was first talking to her and that has been choing in my gfs mind.
Its been extremely difficult for her we have two dogs now i was hoping us having two pups to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again bc we have them to bond over but she still cant say “i love you too” she doesnt accept when i try to give her compliments bc ive said rude things in the past when i use to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you but i dont see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trumming my nails, wearing versace crystal noir and ither fragrances etc. Which i believe is the reason why most girls even if theyre taken at least are willing to have a convo with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self development and even though ive been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, i never let it get me down and i
m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women even though i may not have hollywood good looks or charidma like will smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and i wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :)
Shes 18 inches long & weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
Just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champ every 4-5 days and shes already longer than some males get so I'm curious!
the anime is about an mc thats in a game but she doesnt realise it but the system says shes dead and etc i would like to wath the rest of it soo plz help me.
Lookking for a anime
Idk if to others its strange, but to me it was.
I got covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so i had to tell my mum.
I couldve just lied and say it was cuz of sharing cups or kissing a girl since in BI, but i knew my parents would be accepting... so i told them as it was.
My mum was VERY dissapointed because she thought she new me well, and though i told her everything but now she couldnt trust me anymore cuz bla bla bla... basically he was very dissapointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that i didnt feel like telling her because its private to me... till today she doesnt really trust me like before, but shes ok lol.
Today its my birthday so im sharing my ''strange'' comming out story
I am confusion??? whats going on lol.
This is my first time with sfu mail, after the sem I haven't touched anything school related until today heh, so idk how to fix this
So me and my friend started playing val again and want us to learn comms such as heaven and all of that, now I know what heaven is but I don't know others and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If your still confused ill give a scenario "I hit the jett, shes in heaven" like the location.
Shes an awesome cook does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but shes not a good cook either LOL.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating wellshe cant be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or its a guy)She
's all nice and sweet to everyone else but she's just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong(not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it.
Which is wrong, when she is there she doesn't do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren't there.
The worst part about it is people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The "false advertising" on thr A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill were it says multiple buffs cant co exist.
Maybe im the only one but i think this is all dumb and alsp kills a lot of peoples excitement.
I dont like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star lol.
Its just like zhongli.
He was fine but everyone freaked because he wasnt doing enough to dumster content and was balanced.
Ive seen lots of ppl in the fandom make rude/racist comments about liberty and its disgusting please leave her alone.
And you do realize shes black?
stop making fun of the actors ethnic features its honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general its not even funny honestly its just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And its not even just liberty I've seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmys hair.
(also mods please dont take this down I really want people to see it and I have done nothing wrong I've been having some of my post randomly deleted for no reason)
( As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guac.)
She then told me we gave her less meat when I brought back THE SAME PLATE sans guac.
SHES HOME FOR THE FIRST TIMEE
SHESS FINNALLY BACKK
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my pup im her crate at night bc if i dont she will poop on the floor.
So theres already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then i have work - which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my corgi in my bathroom at this time because if i dont she will reek havoc unsupervised.
AITA for starting a fight with an old friend (Strong Swearing)
Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbeleafable loss to let a broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, down the sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.###-!-###”Y-y-yyy-yes sire!
May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!"
"Now get lost!
This is no place for desease ridden vermin like you." "O-off course my lord!" I ran.
Back down the alley I squirmed my way out of.
Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went.
Further and furhter out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on snapchat with my friend, me and my friend were arguing as a "joke" and then she said she prefered older guys, and my friend was (M14) and i said im a year older than you, and she says "what i mean by older guys i mean age 17" and it hurt my heart.
TLDR; my crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and im 16 and shes 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here but idk if I am the butthole or entitled one this story, this is short but I was expecting to get a tat for my 18 bday like any 18 year old but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to I dm the artist I wanted but nothing for 2 months like yea I understand they booked for summer tats but at least say "hey I am booked for the rest of ____" but I was like ok will I am gonna look at another artist work from this shop that does small tats same thing happens no answer
so
me and my brother decides "ok let's go to the shop and ask then we well at least get a answer"
we go and this young girl attends us lets call her (brenda) I told her everything, brenda said "well u can do the tat with me"
I said "I'll be back i'll think about it"
I got back in the car and scroll through her work it was good work so I went back and told her yea let's do this I signed everything she didn't even ask for ID which I found weird bc I gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on I brushed it off since shes new and all she worked on me for a hour told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her I was like ok great thanks, 4 weeks passed and there was alot of mistakes made bc I got a small tat heartbeat with a ";" in the middle but the period on top was a small heart the right side of the heart was smaller then the other side and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again
So I reset it and yeah oops was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn't dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry ? and like through text she kinda sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if shes mad and like she said shes only abit let down ?
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me and like i apologized to her and she said its alright .
Then i just told her im going to sleep and she just left my message on delivered and like she didnt reply to today.
How to tell whether she's mad at me or just annoyed cuz rn im really confused
WIBTA if I was just be a bigger sarcastic Asshole to another Asshole?
Her tumors are behinning to open through her skin, she wont jump, pain killers dont help, she ate a lot yesterday but wont eat or drink today, she hid most the day but..... Its hard because shes alert.
It feels wrong because she looks at me like "i love you.
Im happy your here with me" but the vet said she wasnt even supposed to live this long and the tumors will only get worse and even if we had done chemo, it would have only prolonged it.
friend told my girlfriend something, she then broke up with me, i dont know what to now because she and the ex friend where the only people that i had.
what should i do to try and regain my relationship because shes helped me through alot over our 2 years of dating
TLDR
gf broke up with me bc something someone said and i want to regain relationship with my gf
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee bc shes a poc with tattoos and”fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up bc I need to protect my staff but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex looooves kids.
She was playing captain save a hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman's situation with this girl's "crazy" baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in eachothers life.
it hasn't even been two months!!!
IM SO HURT.
SHE NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A LIFE WITH ME.
I KNEWWWWW she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, soon as he saw That I was weeping, answer'd, "Come with me."
Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.
Ent'ring he led me with him on the bounds Of a great circle itself encirclign a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land with lava pyramids cover'd, With sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life Save for those imprison'd in it, who, though they surrounded Us, dar'd not approach for fear of master.
As mine ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, Cries, and explosions that made th' eternal air Tremble, caus'd by slaughter, starvation, withering, and Grief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, Of men, women, and children.
Theyve grown out to the point they look kinda awkward and shes saying i should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something Id like better?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SHE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME CLOTHES THAT FIT ME IM DYINGGGG SHES SO SUPPORTIVE AND NICEE OMGGG
So its 0:34 the first of January while posting this and my Sister (f14) just Ruined my New Year by Calling my Mum Fat and telling her shes a drinker when she Poured herself a glass of champagne, wich she only does on her Birthday on chrismas eve and on New year.
Now my Parents are pissed of, my grandparents are pissed off and my Sister thinks she was Funny.
The same thing happend on Chrismas eve and now the whole feeling of new year is gone and i hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sry for spelling
Screw INTJ’s.
Why they gotta be good at EVERYTHING?!
It was a MISTAKE getting the booster the day before new years.
I feel like absolute dog water.
literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and i almost cried🙏 im so happy bro.
shes so cool.
im gonna ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :)
also, happy nye/happy ny everyone!!
first of all, the satisfaction i get from saying i am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
a high i’ll never come off of.
second of all, customer comes in for the second time mad because i didnt do copies from a book because of copyright.
she goes “well i called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
and im like ?? ma’am its in our policy idc what customer service says.
she keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy” like lol not when you act rude like that.
our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and shes such a cuddly, loving, little girl and i love her cuddles every night and in the morning im just scared that she isnt gonna be like that after she gets fixed?
am i over thinking it?
do you think since shes in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she'll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I domt fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently shes been asking me if i'll fart infront of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and its weirf shes never heard me do it.
I can't believe she saying im depressed looking while shes so shy girl and weird thinking she's not,so delusional i hate it,but they are mine only friends,she calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to d2 after several year, now I’m windering: Where do you guys sell/buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or are there a website that’s more efficient?
Mine friends are mean and delusional,one is immiture and shy and always pulling me down,other is fine just jealous and its getting on my nerves,what to do?
This is a set up I can live with.
My bf and my's fear however is in a few years when we're ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own bf.
I'm very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow anymore pushing of the boundries.
What do I do here?
Boundry Issues w/ my boyfriends alter
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was upfront when we met and said shes sh** at texting, and has apologies when we were speaking for slow replies, something which I said don’t worry, I know your busy!
Convo seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation, however I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread)
but
she’s viewed my story & posted a story since, it was NYE.
So i was all ready for the new year actually thinking positive and the changes im going to make etc then i see hes posted a picture of them both that shes took saying 'love of my life'.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face
Exes bf posted a pic of them :(
Everytime i ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even tho shes older wtf) and that i shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her, she drains the life out of me, I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently ive been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, i could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brang herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great im sooooo happy.
On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat.
I look on it again i see jane but this time i can look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So i just got my first beardie.
Hes only a moth old and like most new owners im worried about if hes or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day but so far ive only been able to feed about 6-7 crickets .
Ive tried feeding him some vegies too but the guy doesnt show any interest in them.
Is there anything Im doing wrong or is he just fine and im overly worried.
Then I foundout about this really cool website called Complex
.
Theyre sort of like journalism but better since theyre all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through complex.
before I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic but travis scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
now i like tame impala and ive started dressing weirder, i bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully ill wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromitise himself/herself on social media?
is it just me cringing at the twitter posts by albatross?
everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
hes making it seem like xvg is a sinking ship atm and its doing fine.
soo i have this friend IRL.
man the dude is known everywhere.
hes got a solid rep in the streets, in the jails, everywhere this guy goes everyone knows him.
he was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on reddit because i feel like i'm not really known.
how do you get hella karma?
Im 21 hes about to be 23, my issue is that he seens to have no ambition anymore, he doesnt work and doesnt make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an emt, he failed it the first time by 2 points and I think he fears failure that he doesnt really want to try anything anymore.
Hes been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
Ive gotten super smough about 5 times but i always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear im far enough away but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
Im using 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helm and naked (even with tattered armor it doesnt seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know throwing myself at them enough times ill get them but its slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do but i seem to always get caught in a dumb combo or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or noticed the letter I put in there, annnd now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you, you read this sentence wrong too?
*WELL NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION* I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :^)
19/F Aww shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time
If I just wana make draven my 1 carry how should i do it.
I know hes a good unit but what items can turn him into a god.
I tried heali g sword n rfc but i get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character however his shield is gun is op and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets thats fine.
However
I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate because it got absorbed.
Idk about other players oppinions but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so hes not op evough to counter everything.
Tell me what you ppl think
I didn't think anything of it so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him the EK started screaming "MOOOOOMMYYYYYY HE STOOOOLE MY COOOOOOKIES!!!"
At first I was startled i started to get nervous and i froze.
Then EP walks up and starts yelling "GIVE THOSE COOKIES FROM MY DAUGHTER GIVE THEM BACK!!"
And I did not know what to say at first but then something came so mind just say " but I didnt."
But the way I said was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That's when my dad noticed (hes old sad he didn't realise a little bit ealier) he called a manager to the seen and the manager told us to continue and he'll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We're both xxx majors (I'm a dual xxx and yyy major while she's a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn't say I'm smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I'm a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off.
I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences.
I looked over my bank stanments and there is was.
My NEW prim bill.
I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport.
They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.
The next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me.
We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed.
Both dated added up to what i had told her before.
She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tmrw im no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach put all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance and he messaged me on friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said i didnt change anything.
After that part of the convo ended i asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
he said that hes good when he doesnt think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him etc.
Day 1 of no contant starts tmrw.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster we used my name and ill credit his Instagram below hes a good guy im glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and or story would you guys like either home made lore or not?
i could=t post this on the fallout Reddit for some reason, wouldn't let me put the photo hope its good guys!
is it even possible for itsoktocry to blow up outside of the 3 songs hes had do extremly well? Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for awhile and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much i despises griefers because they dont just destroy something in a game they destroy HOURS of work and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying im mean if i dont go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non stop how im 'mean' or a 'bad person' because im busy doing something so i cant go give him his shit.
Well I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I dont see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy,we do get slightly tipsy ya know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a fb message saying hes ready for her to leave (she'd been there 2 hrs at this point) and then he starts passive aggressive cleaning in front of us.
Hes going through a divorce so he keeps telling me thats taking all his money.
I didnt give him a title as I didnt even get one when i bought it.
It was salvage from some guys as a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale but I've long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do y'all think its not worth it?
Also if I did want to how would i?
So I just told this guy in my class who was also weird af and gave it to him saying oof I sat on jt it broke do u just want it.
Hes like no ew.
I have ocd and immediately got ashamed and was like lol whys it gross it's the same as a whole one and along that line like lol why and he was like ok oof it's not and I'm like lol why did you say that.
I was saying it jokingly but I'm afraid I looked weird like wtf whys she upset or playfully upset that I dont want it.
My hooman staff cooms home tastin of sos ages and cheez.
I think she has anovver fluff she is makin treets for.
Shud I bee sad or anger?
Wat duz yur hooman taste of wen they coom home?

anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday i finally mustered up the courage to message him.
me: hey how's everything
him: it's been time
me: sorry abt last year, i was super awkward around you lol
him: lol nah dwai
*

him: haha you could've just told me!
next time you see me just say hi.
do you still go to (school)?
I'm not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn't sit well with me.
Hey gyz just wanted to share this helpful app with you all :D .
Its not tht i am trying to promote this app or something, it really helped me a lot thts why thought it might evn help u gyz out .
I 've seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team ovr's and many are thinking to buy players but cant decide which will boost their team ovr's the most .
This app helps to calculate the ovr of ur team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people(f2p players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team ovr since it will result in a huge loss of coins(coz of 10% EA tax).
Whats the wecommended amount of wedicated wam i shud have to servur?
IF u r readin this, u shud b ashamed ov yurself, u shud b sleep,go 2 bed i say

Just small info, I'm 5'9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k but I really can't hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical "u shud be good but ur not so im gunna giveu unrealistIC GOals", or should i be at 1:49?

Arent u all tired of seeing atleast the first two jumping into battle and wiping out ur whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying if they werent here then well the game would be balanced, well i beg to differ cos theres akai with his insane disruption and diggie with his timely ulti or maybe even irithel might be banned cos of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly the king and queen of this game is lancelot and his beloved fanny.
Yoo know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O desidez to go to gym to do kwik workout, whatever dat iz.
She sez to me, "Yoo leave steak alone, doggo.
Yoo be gud gurl!"
She tied plastik bag reel tite around steak.
Hahahaha!
Then she goes into gym and when she comez bak many furevers later, GUESS WHAT??
Hahahaha!
She open tiny car and look at me and look at steak bag....and she say, "GUD GURL!!! Yoo leeve steak alone!"
And dat is da storee of me bein' gud gurl.
Mom-O sez she shud have brought steak into gym and left on bench next to her wiff her sweatshirt.
Sez she dum not to think of dat.
Mebbe Mom-O will git smart in a few furevers.
Now I obviously can't get out and shut it on the main road so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I've quickly jumped out and shut it.

Or maybe i am just wierd lol

Aita , me (31f) asked my kids dad (43m)to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in kids room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not ment to lift too much or stretch but felt OK n thought I could do it alone .
I can't, I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of walls were I can't reach .
He said yes n today came to do it , after a bit said he was done and leaving, I gave him £20 n said how greatful I am for the help .
Checked room once he left ...
both kids beds full of torn off we wallpaper , draws cracked where he stood on , iv still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent last 45 min picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds , aita if I confront him about the mess or shud I let it go n not bother asking in future
my boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when i ask dumb questions (example, i didnt know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard….. just fill it” so i tried to do it but i failed.
later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?” then when i do it myself and dont ask him he goes “why dont you ask me, i can teach you/help you” but i refrain from asking becuz he gets frustrated
The last couple calls had arguments as he got mad cuz I beat his ass in video games (even tho gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked abt him to lots of my irl friends and they all ask why I continue to be his friend and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only ppl who actively tries to interact w him online.
yeah Ik shoes don't match.
they match the graffiti tho !
I'm trying alot of different styles so lmk what I shud change

I don't remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida there's a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100× longer than when it's not making a sound.
I'd describe it as that trademark dessert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff , and … it’s just dude wt…
heck it’s weird , so maybe it’s BOTH sort of a paradox (life is) but I just wanna know Hinestly did anyone else feel it ?
I want a logical explanation Plz , n if one don’t exist well I mean cuz loooong before … I was “of age” so to speak … for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate cuz I don’t drink but I’ve … hmm I’m an adult let’s put it like that there’s other stjfff out there but Long before thag me and my Family saw a UFO even mg step dad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall n like … it doesn’t really scare me cuz I think it’s the way life is things change they don’t always have to make sense , and others say that

I reside in Hyderabad,India, currently pursuing my bachelors in computer science .
I am a candian citizen but,for enrollment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam .
Now,the doubt that has arose is...wud my admission be considered international or domestic?..
On a side note,how hard is it to be admitted to UoT's computer science program.
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
Wud preffer a hardcore clan with a plan.
With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal / target, that also enjoy teamplay.

Hi, I was wondering wheter or not it worths to drop some money on pets.
Like I saw how much some ppl can spend on them to get good results (like t4), and I wouldnt want to spend that much :D.
Currently I have 5 t1 pets, and I wouldnt mind to see some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping "just" 100$ would worth it.
Does it worth to drop 100$ on pets?
towards the end of senior year and tht summer idk what happened but i got a hot bod n my face was all "girl u been through some shit have a gift" so now im pretty?
I jus made a post on a diff sub about having a nice date today, which is nice, but i am vv hesitant on making frens n stuff cuz of the last two years.
so like, after my glow up or whatever more ppl started talkin to me ya?
n a lot of boys did too!
i never rlly had v many frens so this was a huge yay!
the first boy i hung out with was rlly nice but then we got high and i did vv regrettable things i do not like.
Well tht boy was super haps n told lots of boys.
I dont want to jinx it and call them out by name but im talking with a company and im hoping it works out!
I
m excited about all things ill be able to do with these free promo products to help other ppl and possibly get them off some or all of their rx drugs!
I
m excited for myself because i have a bunch of medical issues that i do not use rx drugs for and the other stuff i buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others and it will help this company as well.
Im ready, im ready!
Im hella excited!
Might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do - plants now waaay small for its age imo and started to grow pistils- should I chop n restart or ???
Will be posting more here once I get...comfortable again.
(Self love is impt!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through ~ will get to them when I can :3
In the meantime, happy new year!!
ps:
I don’t have a SC & don’t take any $$$, I just like to.. show off, y’know closet slut things :) lol
Ttyl y’all
He said "shhh just kis me you fool".
I still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said "No.
You're f***ed up now.
Whats going on?"
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says "good lord wtf happened.
I gotta garden ttyl".
He read my reply which said "I'm so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated".
I just don't know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him, but I don't want to be held in limbo.
I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know when ever I say ttyl or gn or whatever I wanna add an ily.
Just casually.
To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten fold.
I know sometimes I day dream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
Makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
Tbh I kinda hope it is bc I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof is it hitting me hard.
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I(will takes days or a week to respond) but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to atm.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick ttyl either tbh.
Finally they seem to want to engage w/ me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then day of.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on and it’s not like we’re really talking so I just block them.
Idk, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival, I'm still "Ocean Serene” but maybe I'm .. idk that's a tough thing to say, I never thought that my gf was just a random, I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said allot of things, I'm gonna agree that if I change the world changes, the advice you get, it's allways iffy, I want to speak for everyone but at the same time I can only speak for myself, also I went to get some rum and coke, I got coke and a few other people seen it so they bought some coke..
erm, I hope my friends are ok (that's all you weirdos I'm talking about) random story I know, tbh I'm not ok, but I'm surviving like usual, actually I'm all just a bit Right and fine.
Ttyl
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, its 8 hrs to [redacted].
7 to [redacted].
not a big deal
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles an hour drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] i spose [redacted] or [redacted]'s wife ratted me out.
maybe i should block them too
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you and we can see how well that went.
[me] shiiiiiiiiit.
betrayal
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self gratification.
I was in a toxic rs for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our rs we were great.
One day both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
Im going to admit that sometimes when i feel jealous i just want her to reassure me like how i reassure her that its all good but she will only reassure me once and then said bye or ttyl.
Most of the time in an argument its always my fault, she wont admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight wont continue anymore
And I said “But yeah yeah you right.”
And he said “Ye well I gtg.
Im doing something” and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe.
When the convo started.
But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped.
Like what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doenst like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that.
If he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.
Idk what else to put Besides that i hate the current circumstance of life i live in im gonna give a little insight tomorrow Ok i lied i have to reveal my age tomorrow because if i dont Itll mess up the story Um Idk what to type so ill type a worry i have Umm i dont think ill get the tapegun intime Ok bye ttyl everyone
she said something like "but i want to make sure that we go as a friend?" thing and i was like "okay, i know" and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said "ofc i like my long time bf" yea, whatever right haha and here's my question... yesterday when i was at work, she msg me saying something like "how's your work doing" and i kinda reply her with cold tone saying "i'm at work ttyl" and then she kinda upset : "
Okay, i mean i understand you are at work so busy but u didn’t cut me off like this before so i kinda get it that you dont want to talk anymore like before.
got it!
bye!
How do you get destiny delicacies I've seen a few ppl have them but I've never got one idek where you get them if anyone knows it would be alot of help☺
and my machine f!@#ing freezes up it's been happening for like 2 days now... this machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3d scanner but 4 browser tabs on reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% OF MY DAMN MEMORY AND 60% of my cpu power and freezes the wholedamn thing up.
HEY! WAIT!
i've got a new complaint! ..... Seriously WTF are you devs doing???
stahp plz
If you think it's rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying "gotta go I'll talk to you later" then it's also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one off, things happen, maybe something came up and you got distracted etc.
But EVERY SINGLE PERSON ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It's really not that hard to just say "gotta go, i'll text you later" or "so and so just got home, TTYL" Even just "bye" or "BRB" or something!
Today i got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if i did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn't wanna ignore them just to talk to me, i said it wouldn't be a problem if he had just said something like "i can't talk rn" or "im with my friends ttyl" or just literally anything.
He then said i was overthink stuf and i should " chill out" so i left it at that.
So AITA and over thinking things?
AITA for gerring mad at my bf after he ignored me for a few days
So I would usually post this on r/keto but that sub is soooooo intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But like, a girl’s gotta rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
Have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, CALORIES PUHLEAZE”
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their no cheat days mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten free dairy free carb dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
Afaik, the concept of mini album is only around in kpop (maybe jpop?) I
m always dissapointed when a long awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5 songs album.
I can tolerate debut album since you really dont have a lot of material, but if youre snsd or something and you come out with mini after years long hiatus like mr mr, its kinda insulting.
idk what to say lol i'm pretty funny not only bc i manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often but also because i'm just fuckin hilarious tbh
i'm from yorkshire and that probably makes me cooler than you bc the north is just superior and i'm ready to die on this hill but ig we can be mates i would really like some of those ok i'm running out of people to laugh at my jokes
17m from the uk, pls be able to hold a conversation lol
Idek what kind of dog this was but it was so ugly my god who would own such a thing.
Dogs with wrinkles like pugs, char pays(idk how to spell it), bulldogs, boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all, I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally be told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness/ over nose-can’t breathe)
and yes I know I’m gonna get shit on my all the fuckin neck beards on reddit that just ADORE their snot nose little pug, idec I’m so tired of people and they’re dogs.
Everytime i listen to him sht makes so much sense, even tho i dont know what he is talking about, that leads me to belive that either that guy is a genius who can articulate whats going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something?
I mean what should i listen to if i rly wanna find out the truth if schiff is just "bias to Gold" and thats the reason why he is so hard on the current economy etc.
Do boobs=nice, coz idk never seen em before
then he check the oil level saying that the oil also smell like gasoline that gasoline and oil is mixing up together open one spark plug see the massive leak in there literally full up “let me say oil” smell like gasoline I didn’t smell that one that’s what the worker told me then he call his boss and the boss say is not gasoline is just oil “that shit smell like gasoline 🤦🏾‍♂️ even the worker confirm that I ain’t crazy but ayyy maybe I am and his worker” Told me he going to sealed the black thing that goes in top of the spark plug that covers it “sorry my English not that amazing” he said he was putting a sealed after draining the oil as he mentioned is oil drained the oil sealed the thing so oil don’t drip out of it and don’t drip to the floor but didn’t help me find the cause of why is oil getting into the spark plug because a sealed on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️ telling me if the problem keeps on is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way to much oil and is causing the oil leak that if the problems persist I will have to remove it Sorry for the long paragraph but need advices, need help tbh
My rabbit didn't eat or drink so I went to check him, its been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food idk.
(He has constipation so Imma check does he poop.)
How do I sleep if i have to check out my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is gonna become chaotic lol.
i assume the time has already passed for this but idk i figured i may as well ask, i kinda forgot i even had those tix until they announced they'd be touring again today
Now, my aunts (gma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated gma both before and after she passed.
When my gma first started getting sick, sis wasn’t the best bc she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but gma was also scared of covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job i couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back & forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
WIBTA if i didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So i mett this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dateing.
Last night everything was all right she was happy said good night anda ily like every night.
And the next morning when i texted her good morning she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad af all day because of me and but diden't want to say why.
Idk what i did.
I did nothing.
What should i do.
How can i contact her.
Should i give her space?
My gf blocked me and idk why
Mines ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in witch I have a F
, this is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I've done but are nowhere in the books, this kinda snuck up on me cause I thought they were done and filed only to check my grades and find out they weren't.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you at going say "ikr I only have a 89, why couldn't she round up, fml) Imma be honest that's not very helpful rn
so first off bard top what a pick ikr.
lets drop down my main build cause its the best assasin play style i like.
* my core is static/ie/RFC.
now i tried many ways and this is the best way i like to safely clear and lay out poke.
now under certain occasions like vs a garen id go what many would call shot gun bard swaping out static for runnans and if needed Rfc for pd. giving some more tank..
now as for the other two i actually leave them more optional picks in the ap department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain id pick up hextech gunblade this item is phenomenal on bard on hits are great.
if your already carrying hard id go something like lyiandries cause with the lead no one will catch you with this and the chunk is just bardo crazzzzyyyy.
yet two try gunblade and lyandries together but someday.
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years; we're both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It's driving me crazy, how to deal?
This wouldn’t be an issue if y’all servers ask in the beginning do u guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.
Also why restaurants have to be set up like that why u can’t just get up to the cashier and pay ur fucking share or food.
Hey guys bard main, just join reddit after finding out there are other off metta bards!
So i main him top, yes its scary but i do.
So i been getting alot questions about my builds from friends and happy on lookers lately!
thought i share my builds!
Im 16 years old 5'9.
I
m new to basketball and id like to ask for drills i can do by myself so i can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I dont have a decent shot nor a decent handle, i could barely reach the backboard plus i have no friends so dont even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why i wanted to be good at it so bad is because
i just want people to know me as somebody cuz right now im a nobody, i want to be SOMEBODY.
PS.
Ive never played an actual basketball ever in my life.. ikr?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising ykno) but p chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when i want to be), goofy, a lil chaotic, big overthinker kinda deal.
Enneagram type 4 bc apparently that matters (jk !!!)
Honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love ... you get the gist :)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist so a program with med school prerequisites would be preferable, plus, I plan to take my med school abroad (wow big dreams much?
I doubt I'd get in but it wouldn't hurt to try tho).
Academics aside
, the community is also important to me, I'd be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh and location too.
I'm short so if my classes are ~far~ I might as well roller skate my way through campus jk jk.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character. Or, ya know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would've prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do the player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now but I dont know if I want to pursue her its complicated.
Right now its summer break so imma wait til school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person cuz they dont talk to me online lol.
I dont know how long this series will go but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I dont know how long this is gonna take but probably quite awhile.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I dont have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say, that if youre a kid, like an elementary school kid and youre here, where the fuck are your parents???
Lol nvm fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
To any kids here, heres my advice: first off, drop out of school ASAP.
Its a fucking joke.
Also, run away from home asap and do a lot of hard drugs.
Meth kicks ass bro!
Try that first.
Also treat your teachers like shit and throw things at them.
Put tacs on their stools and shit.
Fuck all authourity.
ATAC.
Also beat up anybody who is mean to you.
Jk ;)
Cause I got them and no one to give them too lmao jk unless..........
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium sprite and a mcdouble?
So idk why o got on everyone nerves about the separate checks....
Hey, hi!!
Haha...
Im new here, didnt know this existed until now.
Iam exteremly shy and dont know what Im doing here typing this hahaha.
But hey, first time for everything right??
If we dont click and you lose interest then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry lmao.
I dont expect to get any messages but hey its worth a try.
Ps.
I dont know how to write these properly so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format omo
Oh and if I dont reply soon it might mean Im asleep or playing DnD hehe.
Nvm my internet is down rn fuck
Well I'm going to see if I can buy some stuff off steam now... let's hope there's still some good sales
Okay so I was a totl noob and earesed my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was gonna use but I sent monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
or how do you open the .key file
edit: nvm I'm a complete noob I figured it out.
Possible to retrive monero wallet seeds with .keyfile?

Comment So i can guess ur gender based on ur post history
Nvm..lemmee guess ur gender instead
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the prof is Oct.18.
*(edit. nvm, this part isn't true pls disregard).
*
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is Feb.9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the prof that I'm dropping the course, do I also have to get permission?
I'm planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits btw.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I rlly wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what!?” reallyyy loudddly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “nvm” cuz I felt like I was in the mf spotlight.
But every time, my nmom says that can't be true because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
"It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?"
Umm idk, maybe its bc we're DIFFERENT PEOPLE with DIFFERENT BODIES???
Tbh, have anyone ever experience fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn't die and manage to kill aleast one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch BUT rampage didn't pop his ult yet.
😲Wtf?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky af fighter, and a carry that solo everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.
I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, always.
Possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in.... oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
like now I feel guilty for smiling.
nvm the fake ones ish, but fuck.
haha.
ugh.
why am I still alive.
lol why tf does smiling hurt
Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME.
i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE.
HE SAYS "WHATS UP" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER.
I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS.
AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD.
IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING.
BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD.
I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS, THEN I LOOK BACK UP.
PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS.
Edit: yes I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen.
Useful, I know.
But URGHHHH.
They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
Btw there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: nvm.
I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance, oops now I'm not getting any mp!
Try to type in chat, "I will not cheat on this game!"
message repeats every time I hit enter.
WTF im not cheating.
anyways I type those words into the chat ( "I will not cheat on this game!") and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Wort way to tell a player to turn off Adblock but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player 10/10 never play again
EDIT: nvm, anytime I type in the chat the same shit happens
I'm gonna skip the oscar-bait shit like The Post because there's only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Dems making movies about how (Extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) "politics used to be moooorrreeee poollliitte we neeeeed a return to The Discouuurrrse."
I'm sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.
2mo ago I bought a cheap '95 nissan truck, I was only locally driving so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn't put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd **only** when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can't rev it past 3k in my driveway w/o feeling like I'm going to break something, I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it, it'll hit close-to 3500 right before gear-shifts) I was trying to methodically rule-out what could be causing this power-sap, IE is it the air/fuel or a clogged cat/exhaust/etc or something entirely different?
I ruled-out 'different', I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in Neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone elses nmom treat you like you're overreacting about your period pains?
Hey!
Read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangeroes, is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2mo boston terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside
friends think she said that cuz she was w her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up etc. others think its a way for her to be evil, like think of me cuz im never coming to get that charm.
i think its some type of hoover, good or bad.
any insight is appreciated.
if your a woman please tell me your perspective.
so confused, bt she is clearly w someone else and why she couldnt call me back and why she didnt respond to my txt msgs.
she couldve said im w my bf please dont call me bt she didnt.
Just a side note: my bf and i are buying a house.we
will be moving out in 2mo.
Once the papers are all finalzed.
I have an Australian shepherd 9mo.
My bf (24m) and i (25f) got her at 3 mo.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with a black lab and a dog small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a rat terrier.
Thier play style is boxing.
And one of my roomates (25m) has a beagle.
He doesnt like to play much infact he seems kinda scared too.
i know all of these things about my dog.
i know that it doesn't matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise; doesn't matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business; what matters is that my dog is nervous -- so when i hold my hand out and tell you, no, he's not sitting or lying down because he's calmly waiting for you to say hi, it's because he's nervous and insecure, i DON'T mean it as a joke, and it's NOT an invitation for you to say, "AW WELL MY DOG/CHILD IS VERY FRIENDLY SO LET ME APPROACH!"
i don't care if your dog/child is friendly or "dog savvy".
i don't care if your dog "is just a puppy" (why the hell is that even relevant? is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies? ??????).
i don't care if your child is capable of not screeching "OMG A PUPPYYYYYYY".
can you, y'know, DO something about your child? and also your dog?
But with less than 3mo to go for that i feel I'm not ready yet but having never taken it I have nothing to compare it to besides collegues advice.
Without knowing what I know they can't know if I'm actually ready yet but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this...bad...amd it would be awesome to be done 6 mo from my intro exam.
I'm close...
I just don't know if I'm 2mo study close.
Somm certified advice
(M/5'10"/26/165-195lbs) 2mo progress, gaining too much weight?
Passed my faa ppl written!!!
I know this sounds weird but heres my issue, about 4 months ago i had an 3700X which died after start crashing when i tried to play games and a day later not booting, send to rma, they confirmed the cpu was dead and gave my money back after 2mo, after that i got an 3800X, as soon as i tried got the boot code 7b everything power up but no reboots or video signal, send to rma this time with the store after 1mo they confirmed the cpu was falty send me a new one, i got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom(T) has always been the type where her feelings matter 1st + only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone elses fault entirely.
Ex: I needed some1 to babysit our then 2mo for 3-4 hrs.
Dads work had som1 who had COVID, we opted out of them watching our son + askd my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her *before* I set it all up b/c I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its *my fault* \+
she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her *days* after the incident b/c she didnt call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing, T promptly got off the phone, I nvr got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to Ts narcissism.
I dont expect an apology from T b/c she **nvr** has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
WIBTA for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5mo, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2mo he's co-sleot with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I've been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get 2mo baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (Currently replacing pacifier every hour) FTM to a sweet 2 month old girl and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
FTM struggling with sleeps
So i already have an orange golden chinchilla ( toto - 2mo old) and we have had toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got terri (2 mo himalayan ragdoll) too keep eachother company.
Its only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor?
just always goin "bRRrrRRrrRRrr".
Im not sure if she has a blocked nose because toto, never made this kind of sound....
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
Can’t play till 2moro but wyd like to know so I can make money hunting or robbingeverything and everyone
How much do pelts sell for online???
Alright y’all.
I think I mis-tagged this earlier so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily w a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, & lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, **I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running** (I have no issue w being over 12+ ft from other ppl / usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually im quietly confident goin into these games but with injuries, players missing etc, im kinda happy if we get a draw.
I know they're utter pish and paper wise we should be wiping the floor with them but just not feelin the 2/3 nil vibe atm!
Anyone wanna talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
this is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait nvm shit meme.
i was 6 and playing lego rockband,i decided to ask for the buddy holly pack.
my parents(despite being in theyre 40s) said "how the shit do you know that" i never realised that my parents got into weezer.
so thats how i got into weezer
I genually don't understand how "toxic" behavior is more pusished than literally int or troll.
Well I've had an account which always recieved those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until i got in a bad streak of losses in ranked and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior....
And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in game chat for toxic behvaiour after a report doesn't understand the context.

I know your skin isn't perfect or you're insecure about your nose or looks.

It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.

Can I get a rip in the chat boys, I was trying to go to sleep bc I couldn’t when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says bc she only said my name in all caps and then an nvm.
Fuck.
I just realized im complaining over a 5 minute fix..
Had never heard of this "influencer" before and consider myself pretty internet saavy.
I then lost interest in her bc her IG wasn't that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out and then I took a great interest in checking in on her bc I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while: How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her $$ bc she claims to not being able to afford food or rent or whatever when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers which aren't cheap.
I don't like him or anything but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my bf with him.
I wouldn't do that to him ofc but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?

If there's a ghost in the house, why the HELL would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a lil too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they're screwed.
4. The f**k you splitting up for?!
There's always this one guy in horror movies that's like: Guys, there's a crazy a** killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed!
That's EXACTLY what the killer WANTS!
basically I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again cuz my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her) and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh nvm hes good” and “p90 is broken im quitting the game”.

Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise,what with having an storyline that doesn come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as Over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and neccesary amount of seriousness and comedy, the characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert,Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events dont always have to rely on Neptune presence.

ive taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take NO MORE.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: meh, ok, thats fine.
They then use shit like A sub 1 through A sub 20 for variables.
infact, i have a linear algebra book that did this... A's FOR EVERYTHING.
the pages were just matrices filled with A's.
JUST DRAW A WEIRD SHAPE OR SOMETHING- ANYTHING BUT THAT ISH!
Scariest thing 3ver m8
Well,well here we are again frustrated, angry in front of my phone what a neat way to start isnt it?All of ya readers are my theraphie and i dont ow you a cent perfect right?If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all cause of your short attention span so lets keep it short(what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying "keep it short im a genius ain't i?")Well a tryed explaining to my budds that porn is kinda shaby and yeah just bad and u know who listened.......
Hey,I just want to know what games can I run on this PC and witch nota.
I was a spy and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, mafia and sk had made their kills.
I proudly said: "I was attacked while in jail!", wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and ask me "You were attacked while you were in jail?" and I answer "yes m8".
He then tells me that what I am saying is bs because sk and maf have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously!?
Like I don't rly care what mean shit ppl on the internet say.
But when i got nobody IRL all I have is the internet and it do kinda hurt a bit when i just want to vent my problems.
And I'd be fine if it got maybe a single upv*te and no comments and I'd be fine.
But instead, it's full of people saying
Oh boi u 2 dum for da movie boi, da director wuz like shieeet itz bout da hiden meaningz u have 2 find boi, lyke u kno it duznt spoonfeed ya da film ya kno?
Like shieet y it gotta explain m8, just imagine what happened ya know?
It's no like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has ya kno?
yet when fully charged for the 1st 30-60 minutes, it's always on! which is beaaaautiful!
Lastly, if i do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping) the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off?
wtf m8?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone?
or is it just me?
in searching google i cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues i am really enjoying the mod.
its just a fuckin' ball ache every single time i want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before i can puff...
Everytime i log on i want to chill afk nmz and play xbox and be fat right but, lately i log on play rs afk for like 20secs and i get logged out and its fucking annoying is it my Internet connection or is it the servers or what its pissin me off m8
Next we have my Stats class and I didn't realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework and so my grade was a 70 something and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my Band class is basically easy A as it's show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert and so I passed that gg ez m8.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do NOT go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like "wtf m8?" and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there, did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This years rookie game is actually going to be real exciting, wt line ups u wanna see

I don't like when ppl type huge ass paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me bout their problems I don't like when ppl mumble on the phone or if they ramble on and it's all about then.
But now it just doesnt make sence, you only get 1 ticket per match and if you are lucky you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the 1 thing F2p was always abble to do because of the low cost of entrence and the rewards where good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.

My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No.
Fking.
Competition.
Most men this day are thirsty af.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs.
And i mean that literally.
BUT – thats good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.

Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that, she probably already have one also.
A real digital movie camera cost sooo damn much.
So I opted for an analogic one.

But then how does it work?

VACUUM WONT STOP SUCKING PLEASE SEND HELP, IS IT GONNA BLOW?
Basically if you didn’t know what that is,it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Lets eat granny” making it seem like someone’s gonna eat their nan.
However,the other example says “Lets eat,granny” implying a different meaning to the sentence.
Pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas ig.
I literally couldn't have been more at fault just drove straight into this woman's golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it) she seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it's my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers aswell just very minor body work/paint maybe a small dent.

LOL - adults and people who don't really know how the internet works use this
Lol - not sure why this came up but it's likely an autocorrect but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-
lol is what it has been named
LoL - grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
also confusing because of league of legends.
looooooooool - now, i think my gf pronounces this but she says that this one would rhyme with "spool" but i think it's the drawn out "o".
So yeah, i think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn't exist.
lollllllllllllll - when i hear her say "loooool", this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it.
but i still think that's "loooooool", you can't repeatedly pronounce a consonant
So, when is big Ben going to bong again?

tldr: the title
Other vegans that youre friends w tell you that they dont tell other ppl theyre vegan?
Like the purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community cause those are probably the ppl that would be more gentle w their words, which is what some ppl need in order to listen.
I
m a very straightforward, no sugar coating typa person, and although some ppl appreciate it, a lot more get upset & start trying to put words in my mouth &twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like 300€ worth of fake internet points, like wtf are you doing honestly LOL
Why would you give awards to ppl lol
i just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre googling and confirmed the time that ill be there at.
If she gives any further resistance I think ill just next her/ ignore/not respond / agree with her that she can't handle the place , or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first frikken date
Yes i agree things like tumblr made up identities are weird and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted calling ppl snowflakes is just weak
Give your self a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without ANY unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series!
Props to you!
the New Year’s eve Raticate w hat.

Stop.
I think what i am trying to say...this game is not hard.
Dont make it hard urself.
The main objective as i understood is to get the dragon.
And dont die till that.
Even beter if u outfarm ur oponent.
Just dont die.
And trades in lane...if u see enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights but he was out of town so we couldn’t do that- and now he’s back in town and I asked him what he’s doing on New Years and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers form our work and likeeeee he didn’t offer an invite and then he said if he cancels with them would I like to come over and I just said idk what I’m doing yet so I don’t know Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There’s gonna be ppl on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid

Just kind of realized that I’ve never had nye plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that .. recently realized I still don’t have enough friends to have a one for my 21st coming up...
Idk why I didn’t clue into This tho.
Like I never thought about how ppl have traditions for this night, besides my sister who goes out to her friends every year.
It’s funny that covid isn’t affecting my Ny at all..
Anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight lol.
helo, im looking for ppl to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
just please be aware that im not very good at upholding conversations uwu f/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the "aaa" word, and I want to yank four words, *without* selecting the spaces after "ddd": > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like i see vids on yt on it.
But like, i cant see any mention on the design notes etc.
Where do ppl get the info from?
Dm me to debate pls be well learned in your belief.
I want dms bc Itll get deep and I cant reply to 300 ppl like that.
Also I need 500 characters so here come the blah blah
I m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl but I am saying that they wont like to do it bcoz they r humans with their own choices and not agreeing to be a girl isnt making them a women anti.
Like how many guys around you would be willing to turned into disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time [but how much time?] and maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
but knowing this isn't making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they r asked to do all this.
I wont like it if you will try to make me a man and want me to dance in front of so many ppl eventhough I am a tomboy.
Anyone missing me?
If you miss a reddit friend, read this.
IT COULD BE pME!!
So I just hopped on PC from Ps4, not even 2.5k games played there, played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a KB&M, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with ppl 2k kills and preds even, yet I haven't even a hundred games played and about 80kills with all characters.
Not really having fun anymore, can't improve if I get shit on every game
I see a lot of ppl on here who seem hella said, so if u hella sad I’m down to chat.
They call me nice cream guy in school bc I’m nice, and I like ice cream lol.
So yeah if u down for a chat, or long term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so
so i always see ppl talk about sending designs and edits to affinity but how do i do that??
ive worked at od for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it??
like not even the print sup.
we do every type of editing in store and i hate it.
like we’re out here doing stuff that im pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to affinity based on what i see on here.
but yeah is more of this info on the store portal or where can i learn more?
i
m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last minute rude customers (:
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k and i was like- Hell Nawh That Not Worth 100k- like bruh-
.-

WhY dO pPl FiNd ThE NeW SeT ExPeNsIvE
Ik the girl I posted abt is a troll ppl- but oh well she got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down
It is the bar with the team comp and the status of each characters that is use to follow report team ( like in the actual world cup) .
It can be tweak down to not reveal to much info about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier and you won't have to use tab
HMU with a chat message, tell me about yourself and we can go from there
I dont understand how ppl can build what they do...
i love building but i guess my creativity isnt well tuned as alotta ppls an it bothers me i cant build amazing stuff i no i could if inhave the creative side uggh i just tend to give up after awhile
n settle for simple crap to pass for ok
I care abt how I effect ppl a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in convos w big groups of ppl which is related to adhd.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kinda stand offish to ppl idk.
I’ll try to act like idc if someone doesn’t like me but drunk ppl will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all r adhd things tho bc rsd I’m a good listener.
A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent I can have a really really really flirty personality at times.
I remember in hs my friends mom said I had the “personality ” so I’d probably be the r first to have a boyfriend
but when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds HER accountable she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects any / everyone who doesn’t agree w her and screams about how she doesn’t care or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck” she’ll NEVER take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite all the things she screams @ ppl to NOT do to her she turns around and does the exact same rude petty shit to any/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts JUST like my mom and my mom can’t stand it / accept that so she becomes down right nasty.
In class I’ve usually been really quiet but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click w in class and be reallyyyy really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen b feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk thought.
I’ve always been a smiley happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have adhd.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk which I heard ppl w adhd are both.
Could I be istp ? Help type me pls
Idk if ppl would even want to just wanna know if thats allowed, and if not where would be a good place to post that(ive watched dragonmar and other ppls videos but that would be hard to be a me specific video on there)
like in a good way tho
Some ppl are just indescribable
I ain’t done this before but i’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like interests :)
we can definitely talk abt anime (especially romance imma sucker for it), we can talk abt games and go into detail abt lore and shtuff, creepy stories go hard, and really i’m just down for anything :)
i’m not gonna be weird so as long as you’re not weird any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah if i didn’t do this right lmk :)
oh and i’ll absolutely talk more on snap
The part I'm humming is like "word word word wo-o-o-ord" x2.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like "fly-y-y-yyy."
I'm pretty sure it's a popular song, I've heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah tbh it is i care abt a lot of ppl and i cant just... make people be happy.
But like.... i wanna :(
Just wanna make everybody i care about happy, like is that too much to ask
I think that some ppl here are ai or something
smh don't even try i can do that by myself🤠
Hey, F/19 , bored af , I enjoy talking to new ppl,hmu?!
i started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90s.
she said everyone was watching wrestling back then and it was a cool thing.
now no one gives a shit😭 (i don’t rlly blame them sometimes).
i asked her “why do u think ppl stopped liking it” and she said “cause it’s garbage.
it’s come on fox on fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hit i change the channel” i had to include that in there bc she’s so funny😂😂😂anyways.
Hey, Cant fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting, hmu if u think we could hit off well, hope we have a great time ,future chat buddy ;)😁
kinda weird ngl
These mfs can outrun, out swim or out stam (through venom) anything that tries to get it.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
just finished the show so i’m a lil behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much lol.
also by sidestory i mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
