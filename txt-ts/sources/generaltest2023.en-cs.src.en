The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.
Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.
To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object.
Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end.
But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.
So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.
Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support.
Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.
Scientific facts result from experiments.
The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered.
Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.
This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.
It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.
Going to be my first project car.
Picking this up this weekend.
I was looking for a good first car guy car; and I really love the 80s aesthetic.
Already on coil overs and lowered ride height.
I've done a little research but I would love if anyone has any info about this car.
Personal experiences?
I know they're not fast compared
#Venting into the Fediverse time.
The Domestic Partner and I went to the liquor store tonight for some beers and a bottle of bub.
When we went to check out, the cashier is a fairly obvious #trans woman.
Me, in board shorts and a wife beater, and The Domestic Partner, all tatted up and with a new haircut that he himself described as "making me look like a neo-nazi".
Her body immediately stiffened and there was this look of fear in her eyes.
And then we just... paid for our stuff.
And said thank you.
And I said her nails looked cool.
The smile of relief on her face was a great feeling but the fact that she was scared first FUCKING SUCKS AND I HATE IT.
This is the stupidest timeline and I hate it dot com.
Nothing stops Donald Trump from running for president while under indictment, after being convicted, or even from within a prison cell.
If elected, he would undoubtedly pardon himself to get out of prison.
But he can't pardon himself out of state prison.
It takes the state's governor.
The two states involved are New York and Georgia.
The latter's Governor Kemp will undoubtedly pardon Trump if convicted or even indicted by Fulton County DA Fannie Willis.
NY is the best hope for accountability
There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning.
In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario.
In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence.
At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings.
We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end.
Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication.
We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts.
The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy.
I really enjoyed catching up with Penny and Nicholas from Ashanti Development at the weekend for a chat about their progress.
Ashanti Development has been working with an ever-expanding number of communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana for approaching 20 years, engaging with communities and providing support with water and sanitation, education, healthcare, tree planting and farming.
Communities gain the knowledge to embed and support their own development.
I was fortunate enough to spend a memorable six months alongside Nicholas in 2011 supporting a range of projects.
When we caught up at the weekend I was chuffed to hear about progress, particularly with tree planting and farm support.
Thousands of trees have been established and farmers have seen increased crop yields through a range of interventions from support with equipment purchases to training.
Nicholas is working with farmers to reduce pesticide use while finding ways to address the issues caused by climate change and pests such as fall armyworm, which can devastate maize crops.
Photos from my visit to Ghana in 2011.
The UPS store near me won't allow me to write a label or write on the box.
The must print the label.
They won't allow me to tell them the address it's going to and who is shipping it.
I have to email some random address, with unformatted data, so the clerk can read the email and enter it into their system to print a label.
And they always to charge me $2.25 for that "convenience".
The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night.
It was an outrage, like a symbolic Jan 6 anti-democratic festivus of lies & grievance, self-destructively hosted by American media.
THE SHAMEFUL AUDIENCE.
Licht AGREED to an all Republican audience!
Who vetted & chose the individuals?
There's a story to be reported there.
The ratings--seeking delusional irresponsibility of it all.
It can't be repeated.
I have a very drafty basement, which essentially means I can get a lot of rodents taking refuge.
There have been a lot of signs of more rodents this past month or so, which has been exceptionally surprising as it's spring and I would have thought they would venture outdoors with the change in weather.
Nonetheless, I've had a smattering of plain old snap-traps placed about, and would dutifully replenish the peanut butter on them every few days, as the mice kindly lick it clean.
I finally got fed up with this routine last night, cleaned all the traps of peanut butter, and superglued a pistachio to them.
It worked.
(fwiw, I've tried nearly every "humane" trap on the market with very little success.
I'm not especially happy with killing them, but I won't be taking comments on the ethics of killing mice.)
I'm tired of conservative parties and governments wrapping themselves in the brand of pro-business.
They aren't, at least not in Alberta.
Sure they cut business taxes.
But they also cut grants and tax credits that encourage more business activity.
I own a business. It's successful in spite of the provincial government, not because of it.
Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station web sites are the absolute worst experience on the internet.
Popups, auto-play videos, animations, popovers, and ads, ads, ads.
I know that advertising is how they make their money, but all that garbage seems counterproductive if it drives people away.
This is true even now that goatse.cx is gone, though it would be a close race to the bottom between goatse and, say, khou.com, where I tried to watch a video the Wendy sent me.
On the first train today, the ticket checker looked at our tickets and said "long journey!"
"Yeah and I'm coming back today," I said.
"I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow," I attempted to explain, gesturing at my traveling companion.
"There's not something you hear a lot 'I'm just dropping him off in Glasgow,' " the ticket guy said.
It's a thing I've never said before either.
The thing that last night convinced me of is that we need to be ready to fight back against Trumpism.
Trumpism is a cult.
It is a cult that nobody really wants, except for the fanatics who are in it.
And they are truly nuts.
We can not allow them to hijack our country.
It is time to fight back.
Go out and protest now.
Get some bumper stickers that are anti-Trump and plaster them all over.
Yell back at those who would try to talk over us.
This is not normal.
This is not OK...
My neighbor & I arrived home at the same time and I could hear him coughing up a covid mucus storm from across the street.
So I rushed to get into my apt to avoid him but he still managed to catch up to me to chat.
I swear covid-infected people are zombies trying to infect everyone else.
It is not socially acceptable to go out in public or rush up to people when you are coughing up a mucus storm.
I repeat. It is not socially acceptable to spread your covid mucus storm everywhere!!!
Writing Wonders 5/11: Does your MC laugh or cry more?
Abe keeps his sorrows hidden and laughs easily while Tom is not afraid to cry but is less amused by rude humor.
Jan will hurt you before she lets you see she's hurt and laughs most when things are upside-down.
Mio knows that sorrow is life's constant companion.
After 4,000 of distress Yl finds herself in a place of love and is having huge feels she doesn't know what to do with so there's a lot of both.
#CNN needs to just close down.
Yesterday's fiasco with #MangoMoron was an outrageous fiasco.
Who at that pathetic, dying network was responsible for vetting the so-called "independent voters" in the audience?
Which cable news "executive" made the call to give the fat, lying criminal this much air-time?

One of the craziest parts about my neighbors turning against me is thinking about how much effort it takes to be hostile.
Forget me, fine.
Ignore me, fine.
It hurts but you gotta do you.
But at this point the open hostility and violence is getting worse.
That takes effort.
Slamming a door in my face takes effort.
Our dogs used to be BEST FRIENDS.
And I still have NO IDEA what I could have possibly done to deserve this.
They had keys to my apartment for 6+ years.
That vessel is off-limits.
I am aware of your hatred of Organa.
She is irrelevant to me.
You may kill her if you can.
But another individual often flies aboard that ship.
If he were to die... the consequences would be... significant.
I gripe about dad-ification a lot.
Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:
It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger).
The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.
Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as "caring."
Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic.
Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has.
In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success.

Ukrainian children have a right to grow up in a peaceful and secure environment.
Yet, unimaginable fear, terror and displacement have left them with the invisible scar of trauma.
This Tuesday, President von der Leyen met First Lady Olena Zelenska in Kyiv to discuss how to support her efforts to provide mental health assistance to vulnerable children.
We have already offered mental health and psychosocial support.
All our efforts will help them make it through this journey.
A bunch of shiny new goodness in #dart
Over time dart became my go-to for quick UI.
#flutter is a pleasure to work with, and they have #mobx for easy store management.
The dependency story is less insane than nodejs, too.
Of course flutter sucks really bad when it comes to behaving like a good native app would (anywhere, really. Even flutter web target sucks).
But it allows to move fast and that's why it's ideal for small hacks.

Looking for a list of the best vampire games on PC?
Being able to jump really high, tear regular humans to shreds, use creepy magic powers, and replenish health by feasting on your enemies - this should be a staple of all PC games, to be honest.

Dreamed my parents were playing my porn game and giving me feedback.
In real life, my mom did like a puzzle game I made years ago, and she found most of the secrets on her own, so she wasn't just being mom when she said she liked it.
So maybe she'll like my porn game too?
It maybe has too many language subtleties.
Need to translate it to Mandarin and/or Hokkien, neither of which I know at all.
Guess I'll have to see whether Bing or Google is better at translating dirty gay sex puns.
Been toying with this thought for a little while:
Mental health is often seen as something separate from "regular" health.
Why?
Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health.
In truth, the health of your mind, of your brain, is just as much an issue of health as the health of your foot.
Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible.
In the same way that mental health is seen as less "real" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind.
The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of "My sex is male, my gender is female" seems simplistic and inaccurate.
It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs.
I feel that to be trans is to be "biologically non-binary".
My sex is non-binary, my gender is female.
I think the designation of "non-binary" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex.
I've been, on and off, listening to the works of @iotar
There's a lot of well good stuff in this mysterious collective's backlog.
Like krauty moods and other worldly pop music and radiophonic workshop and all sorts.
Very much worth having a go at.
Also FWIW I like the archive.org interface a lot more than the desktop #bandcamp \- I've no idea how people use bc as their primary music platform (besides the political reasons).

I'd hate to base my business on tech from Google, to be honest, on the other hand Google is one of the few big players with real incentives to create a compelling cross platform experience and it shows.
(And also: The Web is now largely a Google thing, unfortunately)
Also please refrain from telling me that google/flutter apps suck on iOS and macOS.
Cross platform is hard if you want to do it well.
I know that.
Thank you to those people who have downloaded the latest update to Leasey.
A few very small difficulties have come to light.
Nothing to set alarm bells ringing but nevertheless they are being addressed.
A small update will be produced next week to correct them.
Most of yesterday was spent installing the new update for some customers, and everyone who does need that assistance should have received it by now.
Have a good day!
Tech confession: I can't wrap my head around Grafana & Prometheus, at least from a server/application metrics and monitoring standpoint.
I don't know exactly know why my brain can't figure it out; it might be that the tools are just so broad and vague that my brain just hardlocks due to 'too many options'.
I want to make dashboards.
Grafana looks pretty.
Brain no work.
So with a new #FFXIV raid tier approaching, I've long been thinking "man, I'd like to try proper raiding, but Party Finder sounds like a mess, and I'm never gonna find a static that'll have me."
So I thought, screw it!
I'll make my own static!
Full of people too anxious to try joining a raid static, with no expectations of being good at all!
There's... no way that would work, probably!
...And that's how I found myself having to sort out a raid group roster.
I was a voracious reader in my youth.
Then, life crushed my soul and I lost all my passion for fiction and great storytelling.
But, after ~decades~ of reading next to nothing (with the exception of functional work-related non-fiction stuff and an occasional self-help book) I set a goal to read 23 books in 2023.
I'm now on book # 31 and it's only May.
I'm BACK baby!
I haven't really achieved anything.
I'm happy that a few people have come to me in private and said "look, because of all your work, I'm gonna grant you this amount of money".
I wanna see these companies that intermediate transactions explain to their customers how they set their percentages.
They're not gonna talk about this on Bloomberg!
But if Spotify has a good quarter, they will.
Is it a danger to let migrants in at the southern border? I dunno.
Let them rehabilitate the hollowed out and decaying cities across the country. Again.
These people want to improve their lives.
White nationalists, gun fetishists, pro-dictator right wing.. there's the danger.
Deport the white supremacists.
I am so tired of the headlines claiming that "Remote work is dead." or that "Remote work was a failed experiment."
These headlines and articles usually reference one CEO at one large company.
It's all clickbait but it does worry me about the executives and managers who read these articles.
There was remote work prior to 2020.
There are still going to be jobs that can be accomplished remotely for the foreseeable future.
Remote work is enabling.
It enables people to work in comfortable spaces and not stuffy, noisy offices.
It enables accessibility for anyone with an internet connection and a good working space.
It enables people to avoid lengthy commutes that take time away from their day and their families.
To just ignore these facts is wrong.
Stop generalizing and try to understand how your employees actually get work done.

It's not just conservatives versus progressives, he told a seminar of more than 100 adherents in Grande Prairie.
"This is a war between the pro-humans and anti-humans," he said.
Parker referred to abortion, and modern urban women's impulse to delay having children for their careers' sake.
He also argues that NDP and progressives want to depopulate society for the sake of the environment.
"You are the carbon they are trying to reduce."
So like from the beginning for all my birthdays in the past, I always had rough ones.
Whenever May would pop up I dreaded trying to celebrate my bday.
Something would always happen, go wrong, or just end up stressful and depressing.
I fought over the years to get out of that mindset and to have better bdays.
It took years of changing my life and working hard but finally...
I'm starting to smile and enjoy my bday with no worries.
And today is already becoming a great day!
Winter is 30 days away in this little part of the Great Southern World.
But I can't be deceived!
This is the beginning.
The rain is falling and whilst/while it is not frozen, you ain't going dancing in it!
It's a fine day to order ice cream delivery.
It was a one dog night and that doggo was not getting off the bed not even for "Dog's Breakfast - Breakfast for Dog's!"

Does you know of a performant way for a web component to respond to being added/removed from a document?
This is for Wikipedia's component library (OOUI).
It is mostly semantic HTML with CSS, and generally does not require custom elements (which offers connectedCallback).

For performance, we don't observe the whole document.
We create a detached temp parent, install MO there, and observe it becoming detached (thus attached elsewhere).
Casper the #rat is an absolute unit these days.
I think my new job has been good for him - two free roams a day while I work, at fairly predictable times.
I finally got a good dangle photo so I can be sure he's not fat.
(In #rats, too high body fat can be bad for their health.)
He's not.
He's just absolutely ripped from tearing around my office twice a day.
I don't have a scale to weigh him, but he feels like he's well over a pound.
It makes me so happy to see him thriving.

It's 2023 and I still see people with iPhones actively avoid using Apple Maps.
Apple Maps comes default with iOS, and yet people would go out of their way to download and install Google Maps onto their iPhones.
No idea why.
Curious, I kept an open mind to compare how Google Maps and Apple Maps compare, on my test iPhone device (my daily driver is an Android device, so it's rare that I use an iPhone).
The experience having to follow directions was far superior on Apple Maps compared to Google Maps.
Apple Maps wins.
So why is it that people jump through extra hoops to install Google Maps?
No idea.
Could it be that Google Maps got to market first?
Was it the 2012 Apple Maps disaster?
Could it be that Google Search is integrated with Google Maps?
No idea.
That said, I'm biased.
I'm biased in favour of not releasing garbage to end users, and Apple royally fucked up with their Apple Maps when it came out in 2012.
Their bad reputation haunts them to this day.
But it's the land that makes it a good storer of wealth for as long as you think the government isn't going to change the system we live in.
The house itself declines in value because it loses its condition and needs to be replaced.
A lot of ppl think that they literally own the earth when they buy a piece.
Not the case.
In China you can only lease land.
They're not stupid enough to sell the sell forever.
The government can change these policies whenever it wants.
The land is temporary.
It seems inconceivable that land may be taken away one day when you watch Australian and United States media channels but that's because the rich are on there all day ensuring your mind thinks a certain way.
The land is very easily and quickly taken away by the government one day if they want to do that.
And guess what?
It never made sense how ppl can keep land at the expense of others.
It has to be taken away one day.
That's why the Chinese only allow leases.
They already ran out of land.

I often wonder at the human capacity to be *so* down on oneself while inundated by so much evidence of what actual cruelty looks like.
To agonize over personal failure & guilt in a world where "success" is so often bestowed on people responsible for the most reprehensible acts...
We're all such messy critters.
But gentling despair at our messiness is crucial - because it gives us more space to tackle the ruins all around.
So try not to forget, eh?
Kindness with ourselves is activism, too.

I don't agree that #Mastodon is difficult to setup.
Common, it's really not that hard.
But it's more difficult to find people to follow and build up your timeline.
I wish there was a "who to follow" recommendation somehow.
But apart from this, it is not difficult - if you use a 3rd party app like Elk and/or Ivory.
If you stick to the default web interface it doesn't look and feel good (imho).
So, it requires a bit more effort to get into it and you probably need a good app to improve #UX.
I don't know if prevention is possible, but it's worth trying.
The four steps I outline are up for debate, with some progress in each:
Description: names for incidents of human-algorithm behavior that account for algorithms & humans.
Explanation: account for both sides of mutual influence
Forecasting: anticipating harms before they happen (even if by minutes)
Interventions: knowledge about things we can do to create change, within some confidence bounds
I didn't watch the CNN town hall, but it seems as if Trump said exactly the same things he says every time he opens his mouth or presses Send on his phone.
Even if he didn't get to say them during the town hall, everyone in America will hear them anyway, repeatedly, between now and November 2024.
That's still no reason to give him another venue, but the harm is being exaggerated.
He'll win the primaries.
We can't will him away.
He's here and he's going to say this stuff no matter what.
Signed up for Google's "AI Test Kitchen" waitlist and got in same day.
It's very underwhelming at the moment.
The "MusicLM Demo" is mildly interesting.
You can ask for a specific piece of music like "jazz with a trumpet solo in 5/4 tempo" and it will generate two tracks for you after a few seconds.
It seems to understand tempo, but... the music's just... not good.
Throwing everything you've got over the fence in response to GPT is not it.

It's weird doing weightlifting but also having no real clue what your one-rep-max is, cus that's one of the key ways people track their progress.
I work out alone in my bedroom without a spotter or even a weight rack.
Just me and a barbell with a bunch of weights.
I bench press on my bed.
If I try and figure out my one rep max is I might not own enough weights to max out, or conversely it could seriously injure/kill me.
Anyway, load is going up today.
Still feels good.
I swear burrata didn't exist five years ago
This is my personal Mandela effect thing.
I'd never seen it in a cookbook.
I'd never seen it at the fancy grocer or any of the Italian delis.
I'd never seen anyone's mom make it or had it shoved at me at a party or seen it appear in conjunction with anyone's saucemaking escapades or baking days
It just appeared one day and suddenly it was available everywhere.
I've entered the burrata dimension.

In 1998-06 Gamefan, in relation to the long development of the first Unreal game, Jason Schrieber commented,
"A good game is only late until it ships.
A bad game is bad forever."
So was it Epic that originated this?
We can keep going.
An earlier issue of GamePro 1997-11 has a quote with far more ambiguity,
"Or, as an industry catch phrase goes: A late game is only late until it ships.
A bad game is bad for the rest of your life."
Is it so ephemeral then?
Merely a "catchphrase" with no clear originator?
Smoky, my 10 month old male Domestic Blue kitten, playing with a red rubber Apple Pencil comfort device bought from Amazon he absconded months ago.

I really like it.

The eight-eyed Repnids seem to be watching as you settle the flyer down on the red soil, but they make no move towards you, in fact they are motionless as you climb out of the flyer and walk slowly towards them.
The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble and then shake, as if in an earthquake and you lose your footing, though the Repnids seem unaffected.
The rock beneath you gives way suddenly.
Repnids have tunnelled below the surface and you fall into a boiling mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in a cavern below.
The end is swift, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs.
Nobody will ever know that you were the first human future traveller.

#today I have coffee, sunshine and quiet time!
I started a new shawl.
I am unsure of it at this time.
I found a unevenly spun silver gray yarn that is mostly finely spun with lumps.
I plan on mixing it with a fine purple/lilac variegated cotton.
But am not sure I have enough of the purple.
I am using a H hook with a similar double crochet pattern as I have done before.
I made the first join last night so we shall see.
Wishing everyone a happy Thursday!
However, I hate classes on fine arts and literature, and my school history bears it out.
I have literally tried and dropped EVERY SINGLE ONE.
And up until like two years ago, I had no idea until I checked my transcripts.
The literature class hatred is even worse: I love to read.
I hit most of the classics before eighteen--though that's more a reflection of living in bumfuck nowhere, I also read the 1979 Encyclopedia Brittanica in desperation.
My home is comfortable and wonderful and I am happy there, but I have to be somewhere else in order to chill enough to read fiction during the day without feeling guilty.
It's like I'm on holidays and therefore am doing what one does on holidays.
And that's also even though I haven't slept as well here for the last two nights as I do at home, and get a little #MECFS ed out from simply being in a strange environment where I'm less able to pace myself and have to remember where things are.
And that's also even though I do still have my to-do list and am organising my life as well.
Humanity is out in 5 days.
It's exciting, nerve-wracking, stressful, and all the good things that I love about working in games.
What will people think of it?
I like it but will it be able to attract an audience of the right players?
Will a community blossom around the user-generated content piece of the game?
(I am really hoping so.)
The game's story, ideas and questions it inspires feel timely.
Hoping things go well.
It's ThinkPad day!!
Came home on my lunch break to see this sitting outside uwu.
Wish I could take it back to work with me to setup more.
But that will have to wait till tonight.
So I finally watched #Heartstopper
Was it overly cute to the point of being twee?
Most definitely
Do any of these characters talk human beings?
Not even remotely
But did I love it?
Absolutely!
what was Olivia Coleman doing here?
Did she owe someone money?
Had a recent graduate artist take some critique badly tonight.
In part, because they'd be taught badly.
But it's important to not make excuses for issues and just fix them, especially in production when your lead needs changes.
Especially with the competition.
Every artist has been there, made the same mistakes.
Good critique is there to correct the problem quickly, and isn't directed at your ability.
It's assuming you have the ability to fix the problem, or find a solution.
So while composting and bloom scrolling are a wonderful reminder to look up, and be aware of life beyond the screen.
It is as important to explore servers and IP addresses.
Watch seeds being sown & cultivated (and not randomly scattered) by good peeps.
These roots are hidden.
Work is not visible.
But for strong and firm future growth.
Jami slipped the note to him when they passed each other on the path, just before the dog watch.
She was on her way to the wall, he was coming off duty.
He glanced behind him to watch her go, and to make sure they hadn't been seen.
She did not look back.
He waited until he was in the darkness of the bunk room before he pulled the note out and read it in a beam of light coming through the blackout curtains.
One block-printed word.
He spent a long time staring at it, trying to stay calm:

Police arrest 15 after violent protest outside UK refugee hotel
The incident comes after increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers crossing the Channel to the UK in boats.
Police have arrested 15 people after an anti-refugee demonstration outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers turned violent near the English city of Liverpool.
The Merseyside Police department said a police officer and two civilians sustained minor injuries during the disturbance on Friday night in Knowsley.
The police force said some protesters threw objects and set a police van on fire.
The people arrested, who ranged in age from 13 to 54, were detained "following violent disorder."
Merseyside police commissioner Emily Spurrell told Radio City, "It was incredibly dangerous and there were a couple of injuries amongst the police officers."
The Home Office has been using the hotel to temporarily house asylum seekers since last year, according to local media.
George Howarth, who represents Knowsley in the UK Parliament, said the violence on Friday night did not reflect the community.
"The people of Knowsley are not bigots and are welcoming to people escaping from some of the most dangerous places in the world in search of a place of safety," he said.
"Those demonstrating against refugees at this protest tonight do not represent this community."
The protest took place amid heightened tensions as growing numbers of refugees and migrants cross the Channel in small boats.
More than 45,000 people reached the UK by that route in 2022, and most applied for asylum.
The system for considering asylum applications has slowed to a crawl because of political turmoil and bureaucratic delays, leaving many asylum seekers stuck in hotels or other temporary accommodations.
The Channel crossings have become a political issue, with the Conservative government promising to "stop the boats" and pursuing a plan to send such asylum seekers to Rwanda.
Opponents have accused the government of demonising desperate people fleeing war and poverty.
President's Cup: Candystripes defeat Rovers in season opener at Brandywell
Derry midfielder Adam Reilly closes down Lee Grace at the Brandywell
Derry City emerged victorious in the President's Cup as they ran out 2-0 winners over Shamrock Rovers.
The FAI Cup holders defeated last season's league winners at the Brandywell thanks to first-half goals from Will Patching and Michael Duffy.
The Hoops pushed to reduced terms in the second half but Ruaidhri Higgins' charges stood firm to win the curtain-raiser.
Derry travel to St. Patrick's Athletic for the league opener next Friday.
Patching's side-footed volley nudged Derry in front after 23 minutes - the midfielder opened the scoring as the Foylesider's ran out 2-1 winners over the eventual champions last February.
The Hoops went on to win the Premier Division by 13 points but Duffy soon had City further ahead with a long-range effort which managed to squirm under keeper Leon Pohls and into the net.
Last season's runners-up were two goals to good at the break.
Graham Burke went closest to reducing the arrears in the second period but the Candystripes were comfortable winners a week prior to their quest for national glory.
City boss Ruaidhri Higgins praised his team after what he said was the "hardest week of my life" following the death of his brother Kevin.
"It's a kick in the teeth and there's tough weeks ahead but we'll get on with it in his memory," said Higgins.
"To beat Shamrock Rovers and deservedly so with a good performance is really pleasing."
DHS hires law firm to handle possible Alejandro Mayorkas impeachment proceedings
The Department of Homeland Security has hired an outside law firm - Debevoise & Plimpton - to assist in possible impeachment proceedings for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, as he potentially faces charges by House Republicans regarding his handling of the southern border.
"The Department of Homeland Security has retained outside counsel to help ensure the Department's vital mission is not interrupted by the unprecedented, unjustified, and partisan impeachment efforts by some Members of Congress, who have already taken steps to initiate proceedings," a DHS spokesperson said in a statement Friday.
"DHS will continue prioritizing its work to protect our country from terrorism, respond to natural disasters, and secure our borders while responding appropriately to the over 70 Congressional committees and subcommittees that have oversight of DHS."
A DHS official tells CBS News the department has hired the firm for contracted work for the life of the congressional inquiry.
Debevoise was chosen because of its expertise in impeachment and bipartisan experience in working with Congress on oversight.
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas speaks during a joint news conference with Mexican officials at the State Department in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, 2022.

The Justice Department recently advised that the contract with Debevoise qualifies as an appropriate expenditure for DHS.
DHS is trying to ensure that its mission isn't undermined by partisan attacks and that proceedings against Mayorkas are being handled by people with the appropriate expertise.
Mayorkas has not commented on this development, but asked about the impeachment inquiry last Thursday, he told reporters, "We will cooperate with this Congress, just as we did with the last Congress. I think that's our responsibility."
He conceded that "it will take time" to comply with the House's investigation.
"I will spend that time as will others and we will also not compromise the time that we spend in fulfilling our mission."
A DHS senior official confirmed that Mayorkas has not yet met with his new outside counsel.
Only one cabinet member has ever been impeached, Secretary of War William Belknap.
In 1876, Belknap, who served in President Ulysses S. Grant's administration, was accused of accepting bribes but was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.

Four teens charged in attack of 14-year-old who died of suicide after beating video was posted online
Dad says daughter took her own life after being bullied at NJ school
Dad says daughter took her own life after being bullied at NJ school 02:33
Four New Jersey teenagers have been charged in connection with the attack of a 14-year-old girl who later took her own life after video of the incident was posted on social media.
One juvenile is charged with aggravated assault, two juveniles are charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and one juvenile is charged with harassment, Ocean County prosecutor Bradley D. Billhimer told CBS News in an email.
Adriana Kuch, 14, was found dead in her Bayville home on February 3, two days after the disturbing video of the attack at Central Regional High School was posted online.
The video showed girls throwing a drink at the teen, then kicking and dragging her down school hallways.
They pushed Adriana into red lockers lining the school hallways and one of the girls in a pink shirt punched Kuch repeatedly.
Another girl outside of the video frame laughed as she recorded the scene.
Two adults came in to break up the attack, with one adult pulling the teens apart.
Adriana lay hurt and bruised on the hallway floor as the adult tried to help her up.
One of the girls said, "That's what you get."
"She loved life. She was the happiest kid. Everybody loved her," her father, Michael Kuch, told CBS New York on Thursday, adding that he's angry and wants everyone to see the video and what the teens did to his daughter.

Kuch said police should have been called immediately because the students, who he said his daughter had been having problems with, smashed her face with a 20-ounce bottle.
"If they called the police and did an investigation, those girls would not have posted videos from school," Kuch said.
He also said his daughter, who had bruises on her body, should've been taken to the hospital.
"We always address every issue of bullying and on the day of the incident four students were suspended," Dr. Triantafillos Parlapanides, superintendent of schools, told CBS New York.
School officials told CBS New York that they notified the family and called Adriana's death horrible.
Each teenager and their guardian was served with a copy of their complaint and were released pending future court appearances, the prosecutor told CBS News.
Students at the school staged a walkout Wednesday in support of Adriana's family.

I talked to 30 health, wellness professionals about avoiding burnout
In our day-to-day lives, we're constantly looking for ways to increase our energy and avoid burnout, especially in our jobs.
This can be extremely difficult for those in the healthcare industry, which is why I asked 30 health and wellness professionals the same question: "How do you manage your energy and not burn out in your profession?"
Their careers range from infectious disease doctors to psychologists to mindfulness teachers - and they all had great advice to give on how to stay motivated and keep the ball rolling.
Despite the large differences in their roles, there were several themes within their responses that stood out as ways to prevent burnout.
Here are the top four approaches that they use.
1.Build a strong community
As someone who works with patients who have terminal illnesses, Eufrosina Young thanks her strong support system for her ability to maintain her energy.
Young is a board-certified neurologist and ALS specialist at the Upstate University Hospital's department of neurology, and says they "mobilize like an army of people" there.
There isn't a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but knowing that she isn't the only one putting in the hard work to develop treatments and provide better options for her patients, keeps Young going even on her hardest days.
"We're not carrying the weight of the world, but being part of a world of people that are advocating for this work," she says.
2.Rest when you need to
Working two jobs as a sleep researcher and an algorithm engineer, all while taking care of a new baby, would have definitely led Raphael Vallat to burnout if he didn't rest, he says.
"I feel like when I'm about to burn out, basically every task feels like a mountain that you need to climb, and feels super urgent and important," says Vallat.
In those moments, "you really need to take some time off and realize that these tasks can wait."
Typically, Vallat finds moments in his day where he can pause and spend time in nature to ground himself before returning to work.
3.Be passionate about what you're doing and remember your purpose
Up until spring of 2022, infectious disease specialist Céline Gounder worked 100 hours a week for seven days a week.
Being on the frontlines during the pandemic ate up almost all of her time, but she avoided burnout by reminding herself about why her work is important.
"I don't think work feels like work when you feel like you're having an impact," says Gounder.
"If you're working crazy hours doing something that has no meaning to you, I think you really do need to step back and question what you're doing."
4.Have other joys
Across the board, each of the experts said they engage in some hobby like exercise, dancing and even playing the guitar.
It's extremely important to have a life you enjoy that exceeds what you accomplish in your job, says Christina Maslach, social psychologist, retired professor of psychology at U.C. Berkeley and author of "The Burnout Challenge: Managing People's Relationships with Their Jobs."
"Look at your life as a whole, and make sure there's good things about it, and make sure you have time for them."

Juvenile charged with murder in December Chicago school shooting that left 2 dead
A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of two students at a Chicago high school in December, police announced Friday.
The suspect is charged with two counts of felony first-degree murder and two counts of felony attempted murder, Chicago Police superintendent David Brown announced.
"We currently don't have a clear motive for why a 16 year old would want to shoot and kill other kids," Brown said.
The suspect's name was not released Friday due to his age, although Brown said he would face the murder and attempted murder charges as an adult.
Four teenagers were shot December 16 at Benito Juarez High School.
The victims who died were both boys, aged 14 and 15, police announced at the time.
Investigators say tips from the public helped lead them to the suspect, who was arrested Thursday.
"We are grateful for those who have been brave enough to come forward to ensure that the offender is caught and will now be held accountable," said Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx.
The suspect is expected to appear in Bond Court Saturday, Brown said, where more details about the evidence they have collected will be presented.
Minnesota biologists rescue trapped black bear
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources came to the rescue of a bear-y unlucky bear after it became trapped in a ditch.
The bear had hunkered down in a culvert alongside the road near Wannaska, Minnesota, according to a Facebook post from the department.
But when the snow began to melt, the culvert started to flood, trapping the bear in deep snow and ice, according to the department.
Staff from the department quickly responded to the scene and helped remove the bear.
The department's bear biologist, Andrew Tri, "examined the bear and pronounced him healthy but groggy - obviously, because he'd been woken up from his winter sleep," according to the Facebook post.
The department then relocated the bear to a state sanctuary to resume his hibernation.
The sleepy carnivore was estimated to be 6 years old and between 375 and 400 pounds.
The department reminded residents that moving bears is a job best left to the professionals.
If you're worried about a bear in your neighborhood, you should contact local authorities - not try to move or feed the sleeping giant.
In this case, bystanders first tried to dig out the bear by themselves and offered him food, including Pop-Tarts, lettuce and Fancy Feast cat food.
But, luckily for the well-intentioned diggers, "because bears don't have the desire to eat in the winter, the bear didn't bite."
Minnesota is home to between 12,000 and 15,000 black bears, found mainly in the northern third of the state, according to the Department of Natural Resources.
The predators hibernate for as long as six or seven months in the winter, during which time they do not eat and live off of their stored body fat.
Photos: Following restorations, Egypt inaugurates the Djehuty and Hery tombs
The tombs of Djehuty and Hery have been inaugurated on Thursday following the completion of restoration work.
The inauguration was conducted by the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt Mostafa Waziri, Ambassador of Span to Egypt Alvaro Iranzo, and the President of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Eloísa del Pino.
Waziri explained that the two tombs were discovered through the joint Egyptian-Spanish archaeological mission from the Supreme Council of Antiquities and CSIC, working since 2002.
He said that the mission carried out excavation and restoration work and published research related to the tombs, which are located in the Dra Abu al-Naga area on the west bank of Luxor.
They succeeded in uncovering many tombs, coffins, mummies and a funerary garden.
Important tombs from an important era
Wazir explained that these two tombs belong to prominent people, who lived during the beginning of the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom - one of the most important eras of ancient Egypt.
He said that the layout of the tombs are T-shaped, a style commonly used in tombs from the 18th dynasty.
These consistent of an entrance, a column hall leading to a burial shaft, and walls featuring distinct inscriptions.
Waziri added that Djehuty was supervisor of the state treasury and overviewed works of craftsmen and artists during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.
Djehuty was also responsible for recording Hatshepsut's journey to Puntland, and providing electrum (a mixture of gold and silver) for covering the top of the obelisks that she placed in the Karnak temples.
In addition, he was in charge of the process of moving the obelisks.
The room that precedes the Djehuty's burial chamber features inscriptions engraved with 43 chapters of the Book of the Dead, the first time that the chapters of the book were written on the walls of tombs before being written on linen and papyrus.
Hery, held the position of superintendent of the royal stores of the sacred royal wife and mother, Ahhotep.
Jared O'Mara should never have been a Labour candidate, says Rachel Reeves
The disgraced former MP Jared O'Mara "should never have been selected as a Labour candidate" and deserves his four-year jail sentence, the shadow chancellor has said.
Rachel Reeves was talking to the Guardian in the Bolton North East constituency on Friday, hours after key figures in the local party quit in protest at how Labour's national executive committee (NEC) was controlling the parliamentary selection process for the next general election.
The entire selection committee in Bolton North East resigned after they were not allowed to choose the shortlist, an increasingly common practice in Keir Starmer's Labour party, saying: "Yet again, it appears that the Labour party is seeking to promote the views and attitudes of a clique in London, rather than local members in the north."
They added: "This goes against the attitude necessary to win back the red wall, which is so desperately needed to deliver a Labour government."
Reeves said: "I don't know what the circumstances are of what has happened in Bolton, but I do know that those being selected are strong candidates, often with very strong roots in their communities."
There has been particular unhappiness that Leigh Drennan, the chair of Labour North West and aide to the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Warrington North MP Charlotte Nichols, was not longlisted to try to win the seat back from the Conservatives, despite garnering nominations from four big trade unions.
Reeves said she had nothing to do with candidate selection, but added: "I do know that it's really important that we have rigorous processes for who can be longlisted and who can be shortlisted."
O'Mara was imprisoned for four years this week after a jury found he had submitted fake expense claims totalling £52,000 in an attempt to fund his cocaine and alcohol abuse.
Many people have suggested he was not properly vetted by Labour when he was selected to fight Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, in Sheffield Hallam in 2017"s snap general election.
Asked if the O'Mara debacle was looming large in the minds of Labour's NEC, Reeves said: "I don't want to suggest in any way that anyone not on a shortlist is a cocaine user.
But Jared O'Mara was a terrible case.
He should never have been selected as a Labour candidate; he should never have been an MP.
He used public money, it's absolutely right he's received his sentence."
The O'Mara circumstances were "pretty exceptional," said Reeves, but she acknowledged: "There are important lessons to be learned for the Labour party and all political parties on the selection of candidates.
But I would also say, in this parliament we have seen the constant undermining of standards in politics, not least by a succession of prime ministers and fines and parties and standards falling well short of what you could expect."
She added: ""One thing I would say about the Labour party is that when people do wrong, they lose the whip. And that's just not the case in the Conservative party."

Reeves was in Bolton to meet apprentices at a training centre for Openreach, which provides the UK's broadband network.
After watching apprentices climb up pretend telegraph poles at the £1.7m site, Reeves discussed Labour's plans to overhaul the apprenticeship levy, which forces larger firms to put aside 0.5% of their payroll to fund apprentices.
Businesses complain the levy is too inflexible. For example, said Reeves, Openreach "wants to retrain people who work on copper to work on fibre, but the apprenticeship levy doesn't have that flexibility around retraining."
Reeves said Labour would change the levy so companies could use the money to retrain employees in industries such as the automotive sector and those currently fitting gas boilers.
"We need them as part of the energy transition to net zero to be learning the skills to work on electric vehicles or fitting heat pumps or hydrogen boilers.
We want those people to be retrained to get the skills that they need to succeed.
And yet the apprenticeship levy is stacked up against them.
Businesses want greater flexibility and young people starting off in life or older people who want to retrain to make sure that their skills are relevant for the future," said Reeves.
One arrested amid Tate Britain protest over drag queen children's event
One person has been arrested amid a protest outside Tate Britain, where a drag queen storytelling event for children was being hosted.
The Metropolitan police said one person was arrested on suspicion of making a racially aggravated comment towards a police officer outside the art gallery near Westminster.
No injuries have been reported and officers remain at the scene, the force said.
The Tate was hosting Drag Queen Story Hour UK on Saturday, with tales told by Aida H Dee, who the gallery's website describes as "the first drag artist in Europe to read stories to children in a nursery."
A rightwing group of protesters demonstrated outside the gallery and were met by counterprotesters led by trans-rights campaigners and political groups, including Stand Up to Racism.
Officers had to form a corridor so attenders could get into the venue.
Writing on Twitter, the drag queen said the day had been "proper emotional," adding that five protesters had gained entry to the Tate and "caused a disruption" in parts of the building, but they did not affect the readings.
She had previously told Pink News that the invite to the Tate for the event during LGBTQ+ history month had been "an honour."
Her readings have previously been targeted by protesters.
The Drag Queen had said that "risk assessments" had taken place beforehand - but added it was "ridiculous" that they were necessary.
Aida tweeted: "5 haters made it into the Tate. They caused a disruption. BUT not to Drag Story Hour UK ...They made a fuss elsewhere in the building, not where the show was!! SHOW 2 went swimmingly!!!"
Aida had been staging three storytelling sessions on Saturday at 11am, noon and 2pm.
A spokesperson for the Tate said: "We do not programme artists in order to promote particular points of view, nor to reconcile differing points of view."
Our galleries offer a broad programme and visitors have the freedom to choose which aspects of it they engage with."
Trump's Prized 40 Wall Street Building On 'Lender Watch' Amid Dropping Income: Report
Donald Trump's heavily mortgaged skyscraper at 40 Wall Street is on "lender watch" amid plummeting income and increasing costs, Bloomberg reported Friday.
The vacancy rate at the 72-story building - Trump's most valuable - jumped to almost 18% in the third quarter of last year, according to a monthly filing on the building's remaining $126.5 million mortgage, Bloomberg reported.
Expenses, meanwhile, have reportedly risen 11% since the origin of the 2015 mortgage.
Trump has often bragged about the building he acquired in 1995, which was appraised at $540 million in 2015.
The day of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 3,000 people, a Trump bragged in a TV interview that 40 Wall Street was suddenly the tallest building in the city.
Not only was his claim insensitive, it was also a lie.
Another nearby skyscraper on Pine Street in Lower Manhattan became the tallest building after the destruction of the Twin Towers.
High-rise office leasing in Manhattan has been dropping for years, which was exacerbated after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic as many companies shut down and employees of surviving firms worked remotely.
Wells Fargo, which is servicing the mortgage on 40 Wall Street, "has reached out to the borrower for a status of leasing developments" and the plans to improve the property's performance, according to the filing, Bloomberg reported.
Wagner owner says war in Ukraine will drag on for years
The owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine has predicted that the war could drag on for years.
Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland of Donbas.
He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.
The statement from Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed "Putin's chef" for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, marked a recognition of the difficulties that the Kremlin has faced in the campaign, which it initially expected to wrap up within weeks when Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south.
The Kremlin has avoided making forecasts on how long the fighting could continue, saying that what it called the "special military operation" will continue until its goals are fulfilled.
The Russian forces have focused on Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the Donbas region where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
Prigozhin said that the Wagner Group mercenaries were continuing fierce battles for control of the Ukrainian stronghold of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region.
He acknowledged that the Ukrainian troops were mounting fierce resistance.
As Russian troops have pushed their attacks in the Donbas, Moscow has also sought to demoralize Ukrainians by leaving them without heat and water in the bitter winter.
On Friday, Russia launched the 14th round of massive strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other vital infrastructure.
High-voltage infrastructure facilities were hit in the eastern, western and southern regions, resulting in power outages in some areas.
Ukraine's energy company, Ukrenergo, said Saturday that the situation was "difficult but controllable," adding that involved backups to keep up power supplies but noting that power rationing will continue in some areas.
Ukraine's military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said that Russian forces launched 71 cruise missiles, 35 S-300 missiles and seven Shahed drones between late Thursday and midday Friday, adding that Ukrainian air defenses downed 61 cruise missiles and five drones.
The Ukrainian authorities reported more attacks by killer drones later on Friday.
The Ukrainian air force said the military downed 20 Shahed drones in the evening.
Late Friday, Russian military bloggers and some Ukrainian news outlets posted a video showing an attack by a sea drone on a strategic railway bridge in the Odesa region.
The grainy video showed a fast-moving object approaching the bridge in Zatoka, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Odesa, and exploding in a powerful blast.
The authenticity of the video couldn't be verified.
The Ukrainian military hasn't commented on the attack, and Serhii Bratchuk, a spokesman for the regional administration, wouldn't confirm the drone attack when he spoke in televised remarks on Saturday.
The bridge, which was targeted by Russian missile strikes early in the war, serves the railway link to Romania, which is a key conduit for Western arms supplies.

'Yellowstone' actor Q'orianka Kilcher beats fraud charges
Attorney Camille Vasquez, who represented Johnny Depp in last year's blockbuster defamation trial, has scored another legal victory - this time with "Yellowstone" actor Q'orianka Kilcher.
On Friday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office cleared Kilcher, 32, of all charges in a workers" compensation fraud case.
In a statement shared Friday with The Times, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County district attorney said the court "determined that Ms. Kilcher did not commit insurance fraud and advised the court that we were unable to proceed."
In July 2022, California officials charged Kilcher with two felony counts of workers" compensation fraud, accusing her of illegally collecting more than $96,000 in disability benefits between October 2019 and September 2021.
The time frame also includes several months when Kilcher worked on "Yellowstone," despite the actor's claims that she was too injured to work.
Kilcher self-surrendered and was arraigned in May.
"Today, I am beyond grateful that my case has been dismissed - tomorrow my journey begins to help raise awareness and demand more transparency for worker's rights within the workers comp system" Kilcher said Friday in a statement shared with The Times.
She added that she "look[s] forward to shedding more light on this experience and continuing to do the work I love."
Kilcher also thanked Vasquez and her fellow Brown Rudnick attorney Steve Cook for "their steadfast belief in my innocence."
According to TMZ, Kilcher hired the two in September.
Kilcher broke out with Terrence Malick's 2002 movie "The New World," where she portrayed Pocahontas.
Her credits also include "Sons of Anarchy," "The Alienist" and "Dora and the Lost City of Gold."
She most recently appeared in the road-trip film "Dog," starring Channing Tatum.

Balenciaga boss calls holiday campaign 'stupid mistake'
Luxury clothing brand Balenciaga is still reeling from the backlash over two of its recent ad campaigns.
Months after the fashion house came under heat for promotional images that critics said sexualized children, Balenciaga artistic director Demna (full name Demna Gvasalia) said he's still sorry for the images in an interview with Vogue published Friday.
"I want to personally apologize for the wrong artistic choice of concept for the gifting campaign with the kids and I take my responsibility," he told Vogue, echoing a previous statement he posted to social media in December.
In November, the brand shared photos for its "The Gift" collection, which featured child models posing with teddy bears that were dressed in bondage attire.
Shortly after, Balenciaga dropped photos for its spring 2023 campaign that featured a page from a 2008 Supreme Court case involving "virtual child pornography" in the background.
Parents, including reality TV star and longtime Balenciaga fan - and brand partner - Kim Kardashian, spoke out against the brand and its "disturbing images" on social media.
Days later, Balenciaga released a statement apologizing for the photos and outlining the changes it would implement to avoid similar "mistakes" in the future.
"This experience has forced me to reevaluate a lot of things in the way I, we, work, in the way we create and communicate images, the way we interact with our audiences, and the way we learn from our mistakes and move forward," Demna told Vogue.
He detailed the postbacklash changes at Balenciaga: "restructuring the image department," conducting more internal and external checks for campaign imagery, and partnering with the National Children's Alliance to help "thousands of kids in the process of overcoming trauma and dealing with their mental health."
"It's the one thing that makes me happy about this whole horrible situation: to do something good out of it," he said of that partnership, which was announced Wednesday.
Also teaming up with the NCA is Balenciaga's parent company, Kering, which oversees other luxury brands including Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta.
Under the Kering umbrella is Gucci, which faced backlash in December for a campaign featuring Harry Styles that some social media critics alleged also sexualized children.
In the interview, Denma said he plans to move away from the brand's "provocative" ways.
"This is part of my learning: I will have a more mature and serious approach to everything I release as an idea or an image," he said.
"I have decided to go back to my roots in fashion as well as to the roots of Balenciaga, which is making quality clothes - not making image or buzz."
Speaking of the brand's origins, elsewhere in the interview Demna said one of the most "painful" parts of the backlash was tarnishing "the name of Balenciaga and the legacy of Cristóbal Balenciaga."
"Balenciaga is a house that is over one century old and is based on strong and beautiful creative values, and I have been busy doing all in my creative power to bring it to its modern relevance, and suddenly we were under attack and labeled as something we're not at all," Demna said.
"We certainly made a huge and stupid mistake with the gifting campaign, and we certainly have learned from it."
It's Fake News, CBN Debunks Claim It Lacks Capacity To Print More New Naira Notes
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has described as misleading, the report that claimed to be quoting CBN govemor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, as attributing the current challenge in the distribution of the newly redesigned Naira banknotes to a shortage of printing materials at the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company Plc.
In a statement issued on Saturday, CBN spokesman, Osita Nwasinobi, said at no time did the CBN governor made such statement during his presentation to the National Council of State at its meeting on Friday, February 10, 2023.
Mr Nwasinobi said Emefiele only told the meeting that the NSPMC was working on printing all denominations of the Naira to meet the transaction needs of Nigerians.
He said while the CBN appreciates the concerns shown by all stakeholders about the distribution of the new Naira notes, "we are alarmed at the extent to which vested interests are attempting to manipulate facts and pitch the public against the Bank."
Nwasinobi said the CBN remains committed to performing its monetary policy functions, as stipulated in the CBN Act, 2007 (as amended).
"We also wish to restate that the NSPMC has the capacity and enough materials to produce the required indent of the Naira.
"The bank, therefore, wishes to appeal to the public to disregard the said report and exercise more restraint, even as we work assiduously to increase the circulation of the new notes in the country," he added.
On a particular voice note trending on the social media alleging that the CBN planned to shut down some banks, particularly in a particular geopolitical region of the country, the CBN said there was no such plan and that the claims were illogical and do not comply with the workings of the Nigerian banking system.
"The public is therefore advised to ignore such recordings as they do not represent the policy thrust of the CBN and are only the desperate attempts of persons bent on inciting the public against the Bank," he stated.
Tim Sherwood tears into £44m signing Pedro Porro after dismal Tottenham debut
Porro had an afternoon to forget against Leicester (Picture: Getty)
Tim Sherwood tore into Pedro Porro's "absolutely disgusting" defending during Tottenham's 4-1 defeat to Leicester City.
Spurs signed the right-back from Sporting CP on transfer deadline day on an initial loan deal for £5million with the obligation to buy this summer for £39million.
The 23-year-old was handed his debut by Antonio Conte on Saturday at the King Power Stadium with his side taking the lead after 14 minutes through Rodrigo Bentancur.
But it turned into an miserable afternoon with Nampalys Mendy, James Maddison and Kelechi Iheanacho all scoring to give Leicester a 3-1 at half-time with Porro enduring a torrid first-half in the Premier League.
The Spaniard was at fault again as Leicester thought they had added a fourth through Barnes and while the goal was ruled out for offside, former Spurs manager Sherwood was left shocked by the full-back's defensive efforts.
"I don't want to keep picking on the kid but he needs to be relieved of his duties," Sherwood told Soccer Saturday.
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because it is his debut but Pedro Porro is no bad it is unbelievable.
His positioning is absolutely disgusting, Barnes and Maddison are destroying him down the left hand side.
Daniel Levy was saying this week, they have spent a lot of money, yes they have, but their recruitment has been very poor and this is the latest addition.
Let's not make any conclusions at the moment but what I am looking at is a player who does not want to defend.
More: Premier League
"Antonio Conte has complained about the defending and this player, at the moment is struggling to defend. He is up against very good players in Barnes and Maddison but it is very disappointing."
While the goal was ruled out, Leicester restored their 4-1 lead with Barnes on target nine minutes from full-time.
Despite beating Manchester City last week, Tottenham missed the chance to move ahead of Newcastle into third place.

Jack Smith should win any privilege fight over Mike Pence subpoena
The news that special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Mike Pence raises the question: How will Team Trump use the courts to muck up this latest development in the Justice Department's probe?
The short answer is that any attempt to scuttle the Pence subpoena on executive privilege grounds should fail.
First off, there's a threshold question of whether a former president can even claim the privilege.
Recall that Trump tried and failed to block the House Jan. 6 committee from getting White House records.
The Supreme Court declined to take up Trump's appeal last year, with only Justice Clarence Thomas (husband of 2020 election denier Ginni Thomas) dissenting.
But the court left open the question of whether an ex-president can claim privilege, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting he'd support such a claim.
So it's at least unclear whether a former president can claim the privilege, saying nothing of whether the claim would succeed.
Plus, the Supreme Court appeal over then-President Richard Nixon's attempt to avoid subpoena compliance shows that a vague privilege assertion won't do, and can be overcome by a specific need for evidence.
The court observed in 1974"s United States v. Nixon:
... when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.
The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.
Therefore, precedent is on the government's side.
Of course, however, delays from litigating even a losing issue can be a victory of sorts for Trump.
But further dampening the odds of a successful privilege claim is the previous rejection of Trump's attempt to block Jan. 6 grand jury testimony.
As The Washington Post reported in October, that rejection noted that former Pence aide Marc Short, for example, "probably possessed information important to the Justice Department's criminal investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol that was not available from other sources."
That Pence, too, likely has unique information would help the DOJ in any subpoena fight.
And the reason we think Pence has such information is yet another reason that a privilege claim should fail.
That's because Pence has chosen to write publicly about at least some of his supposed conversations with Trump in connection with Jan. 6.
It's hard to say communications are privileged when you've previously deemed them fit to publicize.
So while the subpoena might present varying political and personal calculations for Pence - who may vie for the 2024 Republican nomination against Trump, someone who effectively condoned calls for Pence's extrajudicial execution on Jan. 6 - the courts should have an easy time siding with DOJ on privilege.
The Case Against a Biden Run Is Obvious - and Weak
Why is this important?
While Biden and his fellow Democrats can't do much in the way of passing laws with the GOP in control of the House, they can still spend the next two years setting an example.
Collectively, everyone on the team should be seeking out opportunities to play Gallant to the Republicans" weird Goofus impulses.
But it's also important for Biden to burnish his credibility with the American people - and maybe be a direly needed change agent in our all-too-tatty political culture.
Washington, a notoriously cynical place, is famous for its common sense-crippling ideas about leadership.
Perhaps one of the most notorious is the odd standard that holds that publicly admitting errors is a sign of weakness and that politicians should go to comical lengths to avoid doing so.
There's another way: In Bailout, Neil Barofsky's memoir of his time in Washington serving as the special inspector general overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program, he described the advice he received from Kristine Belisle, the woman he smartly hired to be his communications director.
It was about as anti-Washington as it can get: "We'll admit and even highlight our mistakes."
As she went on to explain, there's method in a strategy that most people inside the Beltway would deem madness:
This is the best way to earn the press's trust.
They'll know we're not spinning like everyone else.
SIGTARP will quickly become the only credible source for information in Washington about TARP.
We might be embarrassed at times and disclose things that we could - and others would - easily hide, but we'll shock the press with our honesty.
No one else does this, and before long, we'll have a built in defense when we're attacked.
No matter what they hear, the press will come to us first and believe us, because we'll prove to them that we tell the truth.
This is perhaps the biggest reason for Biden to pursue the course of radical responsibility-taking: Moments inevitably arise in any presidency when having the trust of the public and the institutions that safeguard the civic interest is critical.
Moreover, there is vital capital to be earned by owning our mistakes, and there's an important distinction that Biden can draw with his political opponents.
The president would do well to follow the old adage: Tell the truth - and shame the devil.
Some Super Bowl Commercials I Can't Wait to See

The "zoom zoom" kid but the bit is that now he's an adult.
Biden DOJ 'Doesn't Want an Armed Citizenry'
Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) sat down with Breitbart News on Thursday and discussed his plans to block the ATF pistol brace rule and his conviction that the Biden Department of Justice "doesn't want an armed citizenry" in the first place.
Clyde made clear his opposition to the pistol brace rule.
His reasons for that opposition include both general objections and more specific ones.
Generally, he expressed his conviction that our Founding Fathers did not set forth a plan of governance that included federal agencies making laws in place of the legislature.
He said, "The Justice Department is there to enforce the law, not to make the law. When you have the executive branch making the law and enforcing the law, then you have have a king, and a kingdom. Our Founders did not call for a king and they did not lay out a kingdom in the Constitution of the United States."
Clyde then moved to specifics regarding the pistol brace rule and expressed his concern that the rule is part of a greater ATF push to acquire broader registration of firearms.
He noted, "What the ATF wants is they want to increase the registration database for the National Firearms Act. They want to register people across the country because, as we know, what comes before confiscation is registration. And confiscation, in my opinion, is the ultimate goal, because this Justice Department doesn't want an armed citizenry."
He added, "But this Justice Department wants a registered citizenry, so they know who's got what, so they can come after us."
Clyde's contention is that the ATF pistol brace rule was born in this environment of hostility toward the Second Amendment and toward private gun ownership, and he plans to fight it tooth and nail.
He said he has "three tools" with which to fight the rule.
The first of those tools is the SHORT Act and the second is the Congressional Review Act.
On January 30 Breitbart News quoted Clyde outlining his plan to "reintroduce the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act, or the SHORT Act, to repeal elements of the National Firearms Act, thereby prohibiting the ATF from registering and banning pistols with stabilizing braces."
He also noted that he would "introduce a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, to override the Biden administration's unlawful overreach."
Both acts, the SHORT Act and the Congressional Review Act, have the possibility of blocking the ATF pistol brace rule.
But as Clyde told Breitbart News Thursday, the great challenge is that both of those routes will ultimately require President Biden's signature, either to enact the SHORT Act legislation or to finalize a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act.
He made clear that getting Biden's signature is not an impossibility, as there are ways; for instance, the SHORT Act legislation could be added to other, larger bills that Democrats are very anxious to pass.
However, Clyde indicated there is also a third way to block the ATF pistol brace rule.
He said: "I'm on the Appropriations Committee and we can defund this pistol brace rule, through what is called a limitation amendment. We can literally defund this rule and basically say, "No money may be spent executing or enforcing this particular pistol brace rule."
And we can also do the very same thing with the ATF receiver/frame rule, from last August.
I think both of them need to be defunded and I look forward to working with our appropriators to do it.

'We Hope' Biden Has a Plan for Handling Title 42 Ending, 'If They Do, They Haven't Shared It Fully'
On Friday's edition of NBC's "MTP Now," Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said that he has "a lot of concern" over what will happen when Title 42 ends in May, he hopes the Biden administration has a plan for when the policy ends, and that "If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet."
And said that "we've said, you need a plan. We want them to vet it with us."
Polis stated that he wishes that more time was spent on the issue of immigration during the meeting of governors at the White House, but the issue "came up."
We did have Secretary Mayorkas there for part of it.
And so, we brought up, again, there's a lot of concern I share about what will happen when Title 42 ends in May and so, making sure that the federal government has a plan.
We hope they do.
If they do, they haven't shared it fully with us yet.
But we've said, you need a plan.
We want them to vet it with us.
We want to make sure it's not what we experienced in December times five or times three, that would be a disaster for the country and it would be terrible for the Biden administration.

McDonald's withdraws "tasteless" advert near crematorium - RT World News
McDonald's has apologized after an advertisement for the fast-food chain's "McCrispy" burger was placed close to a crematorium in the UK - although some locals did see the funny side.
The restaurant chain has pledged to remove the offending advertising hoarding following complaints from residents of Truro in the UK county of Cornwall.
It had gained attention on social media on Friday for being placed on a busy road directly opposite an establishment which offers cremation services.
The brightly lit advert, which was placed directly behind a sign pointing to the crematorium, was branded as "tasteless" by some angry locals.
"Although I can see the funny side, it is tasteless and I'm sure some grieving family members won't like to see it when visiting Penmount for the funeral and cremation of a loved one," said a resident whose mother-in-law was cremated at the funeral home last year, as quoted by British media.
However, not everyone was quite so offended by the unfortunate placement of the advertisement, with one noting that a person's reaction to it would likely be influenced by "how long ago you followed the crematorium sign wearing a black tie."
One person said they "fell off the chair laughing" when they spotted the advert online, while it was also noted by another local that it was "no worse" than the council's decision to entertain the idea of allowing a crematorium to be built "next door to a retirement village."
A statement issued by McDonald's was published by local media on Friday soon after an image of the advertisement went viral online, in which the restaurant chain said it would remove the advert as soon as possible.
"We were unaware of the road sign in the vicinity of this bus stop. However, in light of the concerns raised by CornwallLive, we have asked for our advertisement to be removed," the fast-food brand said.
Cornwall Council, which operates both the crematorium and the bus shelter which displays the advert, declined the comment on the furor when contacted by local media.
'Gut instinct' missing woman is not in river
Searches for missing English woman Nicola Bulley have entered a 16th day after her partner said his "gut instinct" is that she is not in the river.
Lancashire Police said officers are keeping an "open mind" while continuing to appeal for information about Ms Bulley, who disappeared on 27 January while walking her dog in St Michael's on Wyre.
The force is continuing to search the River Wyre towards the sea at Morecambe Bay, working on one hypothesis that the 45-year-old, from Inskip, could have fallen in.
Their search has been aided by specialists and divers from HM Coastguard, mountain rescue, and Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, with sniffer dogs, drones, and police helicopters deployed.
Ms Bulley vanished while walking her springer spaniel Willow near the river, shortly after dropping her daughters, aged six and nine, at school.
The mortgage adviser's phone was found on a bench overlooking the river, still connected to a work call.
Her partner, Paul Ansell said he wants to keep "all options open" about her disappearance, but his "gut instinct" tells him she is not in the river.
He described Ms Bulley as "fun," "loving," "the most loyal friend you could ever have" and an "exceptional mum" who "absolutely adores our girls."
"She's just a pillar of strength to our family and without her, the hole is bigger than you can possibly imagine," he told 5 News.
Mr Ansell said that although the family is going through "unprecedented hell," hope that his partner will be found is "stronger than ever."
Police have discounted foul play and are treating the incident as a missing person inquiry.
On Thursday, the focus of their search switched from St Michael's to around 10 miles downstream where the river empties into the sea at Morecambe Bay, with patrol and rescue boats spotted in the area.
East Germany's last communist leader dies at 95
BERLIN (AP) - Hans Modrow, who served as East Germany's last communist leader during a turbulent tenure that ended in the country's first and only free election, has died.
He was 95.
Modrow died early Saturday, the Left party parliamentary group tweeted.
Modrow, a reform-minded communist, took over East Germany shortly after the Berlin Wall fell and later invited opposition forces into the government, but could not slow the gathering momentum for German reunification.
"The entire peaceful course of establishing German unity was precisely a special achievement of his," the Left wrote on Twitter."That will remain his political legacy."
During 16 years as communist party chief in Dresden, starting in 1973, Modrow built a reputation as an anti-establishment figure.
He rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment.
A post in East Germany's top leadership eluded him until he was made prime minister, a position that previously carried little clout, in November 1989 - days after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
When hard-line leader Egon Krenz and his ruling Politburo resigned in early December, Modrow emerged as East Germany's top political figure.
But the communists could no longer call the shots on their own.
The following month, he agreed to share power with the increasingly vocal opposition and moved up East Germany's landmark first free election to March 1990, amid growing unrest.
Even as pro-democracy rallies rapidly took on a pro-unification flavor, the communists initially had opposed talk of reunification.
In February 1990, however, Modrow urged talks with West Germany toward an eventual "united fatherland" that would be independent of military blocs and governed by a joint parliament in Berlin.
Modrow headed the election campaign of the restyled communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism, but his personal popularity was not enough to prevent them finishing as only the third-strongest party, with 16 percent support.
The winner was an alliance of conservative parties that favored quick reunification and was backed by the government of West German leader Helmut Kohl.
Germany reunited under Kohl's leadership and as a NATO member on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Modrow became a member of the united parliament, where he sat until 1994, and honorary chairman of the post-communist PDS - the predecessor of today's opposition Left party. From 1999 to 2004, he was a member of the European Parliament.
Modrow's past under hard-line communist rule landed him in court several years after reunification.
In 1995, a court convicted him of inciting the falsification of results in May 1989 local elections in Dresden.
It handed him a nine-month suspended sentence and a fine.
Modrow claimed that the trial was politically motivated and asserted that its outcome would aggravate divisions between east and west Germans.
His attorney argued that he had made amends for previous injustices by overseeing free elections as prime minister.
Later in life, Modrow served on the council of elders of the Left party.
"Hans was a deeply sincere and combative socialist," tweeted Dietmar Bartsch, the chairman of the Left party parliamentary group.
"Until old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
Indian govt withdraws appeal to hug cows on Valentine's Day after criticism
Hugging a cow on Valentine's Day is no longer being encouraged by the Indian government - despite it previously asking people to do so to promote Hindu values.
The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) retracted its "Cow Hug Day" appeal after it attracted criticism from political rivals and social media users.
The Indian government department had called on citizens to deviate from Western romantic gestures celebrated on Valentine's Day.
Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst, said the call to hug cows had been "absolutely crazy, defying logic."
He added that the decision to withdraw the appeal was more "to prevent the politics of Hindutva [Hindu nationalism] from being ridiculed in the face of severe criticism from all quarters."
The AWBI reneged on its appeal on Friday saying it "stands withdrawn."
It was only on Wednesday when its statement read that "hugging cows [would] bring emotional richness and increase individual and collective happiness."
More on India
It added that the cow is the "backbone of Indian culture and rural economy... because of its nourishing nature like [a] mother."
There were mixed reactions to the initial announcement as some posted videos of cows rejecting being hugged and charging off.
Others wanted to clarify that the appeal was more for following one's own culture, as opposed to "blindly" following Western values.
Young Indians typically spend Valentine's Day crowding parks and restaurants, exchanging gifts and holding parties.
Cow cuddling is nothing new either - with it being considered therapeutic in parts of the world, and in The Netherlands where it is known as "koe knuffelen."
Devout Hindus worship the cow - known as gau mata, or "mother cow" - and most states in India have banned cow slaughter.
In recent years, certain Hindu hard-liners have raided shops selling Valentine's Day items, burned cards and gifts, and chased hand-holding couples out of restaurants and parks, insisting that the day goes against traditional values and promotes promiscuity.
Hindu nationalist groups such as Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal have said such raids help reassert a Hindu identity.
Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi say his government has pushed a Hindu agenda, seeking the religion's supremacy in a secular nation known for its diversity.
While Hindus comprise almost 80% of the nearly 1.4 billion people, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains account for most of the rest.
Pedestrian dies in hospital after crash with car in Cowdenbeath as man arrested
A pedestrian has died following a collision with a car in Fife.
The 38-year-old female was rushed to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy following the crash on Broad Street in Cowdenbeath on Friday around 1.30pm.
A 24-year-old man has subsequently been arrested in connection with the crash.
Police are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with dash-cam footage to come forward.
Sergeant Lee Walkingshaw said: "Our enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and who witnessed the crash to get in touch."
I would also appeal to anyone who was driving in the area and who may have dash-cam footage which could assist our investigation to contact us.
"Anyone who can help is asked to call Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident number 1638 of Friday, February 10, 2023."
IN NUMBERS: The Oslo boroughs where the most foreigners live
Roughly 177,000 of Oslo's 634,000's residents have immigrated to Norway from other countries.
When you include those born in Oslo to foreign parents, the proportion of those who are immigrants or have an immigrant background rises to more than a third.
In Oslo, citizens from Asia, including Turkey, made up the largest immigrant group, with over 62,985 of these nationals living in the city, according to figures from the national data agency Statistics Norway (SSB).
After that, citizens from the EU, EEA and the UK made up the second largest group, accounting for not far off 10 percent of the city's population.
Africans made up the third largest group of immigrants in Oslo, with 28,020 people from Africa living in Oslo.
Europeans from countries that aren't part of the UK, EU or EEA were the fourth largest group, accounting for 15,566 Oslo residents.
From here, the size of the groups drops significantly.
For example, there were just shy of 7,000 citizens from South American countries in 2022, while there was a smidge over 3,000 nationals hailing from North and Central America.
Meanwhile, there were less than 700 people from Oceania in Oslo.
Alna, in the northeast of the city, was the borough with the most foreign residents.
Some 18,257 foreign residents were registered as living there in 2022.
Afterwards, trendy Grünerløkka, located reasonably centrally, had the second highest number of foreign residents, with 17,631.
Gamle Oslo also had a significant immigrant population, with 17,631 people living there after moving from another country.
Statistics Norway's figures showed that foreigners were scattered all over the city's districts, as Søndre Nordstrand, the borough furthest south in Oslo, had over 14,000 immigrants registered there.
Many immigrants also lived in sought-after areas, as Frogner was the district with the fifth most foreigners.
After that, Stovner, Bjerke, Grorud, Østensjø and Sagene made up the rest of the ten districts in Oslo with the most residents from another country.
At the other end of the spectrum, just 184 foreign residents called Marka home, and just over 700 lived in the city's central borough.
Ullern, Vestre Aker and Nordstrand made up the other boroughs with the fewest foreign residents.
However, these boroughs had significantly more immigrants living there than in central Oslo and Marka.
Those from EU and EEA countries and those from the United Kingdom mostly lived in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo and St. Hanshaugen.
Meanwhile, while plenty of citizens from Asia, including Turkey, also resided in Game Oslo (5,837), the majority were registered as living in the boroughs of Alna, Stovner and Søndre Nordstrand.
Gamle Oslo and Alna were the two parts of the city where the largest number of immigrants from Africa lived, along with Stovner, Grünerløkka and Søndre Norstrand.
Those from North America were spread fairly evenly across Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo, Vestre Aker and Nordre Aker.
Citizens from South and Central America were most commonly found in Frogner, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo St.Hanshaugen and Sagene.
Europeans from outside the EU, EEA and UK tended to live in the town's most central borough, Ullern, Vestre Aker, Nordre Aker and Stovner.
And finally, of the several hundred nationals from Oceania, Frogner, Grünerløkka and Gamle Oslo were the boroughs with the highest populations of these nationals.
Zimbabwe to Start Operating New Coal Power Unit by March
By Florence Tan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will start operating a new unit at its only coal-fired power plant by March, says the country's deputy energy minister, providing relief to millions of citizens rocked by frequent power outages in recent months.
The new unit of the Hwange power plant will lift the African nation's installed capacity by more than 14% to 2400 megawatts.
The next unit is expected to be commissioned soon after, Magna Mudyiwa said, without giving a timeline.
Less than half of Zimbabwe's 16 million citizens have access to electricity, and a global squeeze on funding new coal-fired capacity has limited the country's ability to plug chronic power cuts that have lasted as long as 18 hours in recent days.
"We have the capacity to generate up to 2100 megawatts (MW) from our power sources but at the moment we're generating far less than that..about 1000MW," Mudyiwa told Reuters.
"But our demand for electricity is about 1700MW so we have a serious deficit," she said.
Deficient rainfall has led to a decline in hydropower generation, while the efficiency of the sole, decades-old coal-fired utility has dipped sharply over time while power demand has surged in recent years due to higher mining and agricultural activity.
The International Monetary Fund counts electricity shortages as one of the major factors weighing on Zimbabwe's growth prospects.
Lack of funding for coal-fired power is driving the mining and agriculture-dependent economy to import costly power from regional neighbors including Zambia and Mozambique.

(PERSON11) But for some folders, for some reason, the audio format is wrong, so, something is wrongly –
Basically, the big trade, or something is wrong.
So, some files are still – still have weird output.
But – but for most folders, it should be already fine.
(PERSON1) Okay, thanks.
(PERSON6) Yeah, that's great.
I support this, it's great that, [PERSON7], you have thought of [PERSON11].
And [PERSON11] now has the time.
There are other things where I was thinking of [PERSON11] and that would be training of, empty systems, so that they do the shortening.
So, if you, [PERSON11], had the time.
Obviously, there is no way we could do it for next week.
But we should really have the system – ready for –
I looked at the tutorial from the NLP – was it?
(PERSON6) For the upcoming sessions and I've asked about demand because I've seen the (meme) project demo.
They do offline subtitling.
So, that's slightly easier than what we do.
They still have the same segmentation issues and so on.
But their mission in translation is shortening simply because the data is shortening.
And that's because their target size is the subtitles, which are created for the hearing-impaired.
So, there is like a natural shortening in the data.
It'd be great if we could also locate such a type of data where there is some natural shortening happening.
We would put it in the architecture.
(PERSON8) That takes a bit of time, because I need to figure out which one is the one which is getting passes.
So, once I know that, I can keep a track of it, so, for the future –
Or actually, for future I would not need it, because once I have the web file, I probably won't need to do a convert.
(PERSON6) Well, this, this should actually be –
Can you still hear me?
The sound quality is a little worse.
So, this should really be done, all the time.
So, every time we run this evaluation, it should be run from scratch.
So, every time, there should be a fresh download of a fresh conversion and a fresh evaluation.
(PERSON8) But still, if I am keeping track of the files that need to be manually converted, so that I can write a script, and it could take care of the known ones at least, and of course, if we add some new files, I can see for that later.
(PERSON6) So this is an important thing that we should have come across months ago.
Remember, it is since August that I've been telling you that we want to evaluate on a later test set.
And every time, you all...
It is not just you personally, [PERSON8].
There were other things, obviously.
But every time you thought about that, you thought "this will be easy, we will just run it".
And only when you actually do it, do you see all the problems.
So, this is known, common.
It is always like that.
So that's a message for everybody.
Before you try, you never know what the problem will be.
So, for example, the call that I had, in which someone was interviewing me, so they wanted to record the video.
Zoom never worked as badly for me as it did today for the recording.
So, before you do it, you cannot say whether it will work or not.
And here we are running into the problems of conversion of the file formats.
So, hopefully, we will be able to quickly get the numbers.
So, do you have any word error rates so far?
(PERSON8) No, I have not processed it.
So [PERSON1] said that, once, they get the transcript, we will do it together.
And then, I agree that there is a lot of noise in this dictionary.
So, I asked that you would have various versions of this dictionary by taking only the words that were observed, five times.
And only the pronunciations that were observed three times or more, or something like that.
So, that way, these random errors, such as the example with this four IBM instead of IBM.
This will not be so frequent.
But still, you will have the variants in pronunciation, because if the person, says this "alzo", if you remember, if he says this "alzo" with a "Z" 20 times in the in the talk, then you will see that in the data with the "Z".
And if he sometimes manages to say also correctly, then yeah, again, you will see that in the data.
So, I would like, [PERSON4] to be in touch with [PERSON2].
Maybe you continue on the call, right?
I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids lunch and so on.
But please stay on this call and figure out jointly how to use that dictionary.
So [PERSON4], please show [PERSON2] what the dictionary is that the system is accepting.
Share your screen and show it.
And [PERSON2], please, have a look at that and help with converting the dictionary that you emitted to that file.
One thing that will still be needed is the language model substitute.
But all these words should be known words.
So [PERSON4], you need to figure out what words are in the language model.
And the words which are in the language model should be simply copied.
So, the dictionary will have three col ns.
The grapheme, as it is output.
One recognized.
The phonemes, as [PERSON2] proposed.
And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations.
And the third col n will be also the same again for all of those, and again there will be the same grapheme form.
So that is when the language model sees.
And I think that this way, these systems should be able to load it.
And you will also possibly run into one more problem: that it is not ready for two big custom dictionaries.
So, this is also something that has to be tested, but please test it, the two of you together.
So [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary.
And you know what the dictionary looks like when you are creating it manually, and you need to put these two pieces of knowledge together.
Ah, so that it works with the, with the generated dictionary.
(PERSON4) Okay.
(PERSON6) So [PERSON2], does this make sense?
(PERSON2) Yeah, sure, we'll discuss it.
(PERSON6) Yeah, so is there anything else, [PERSON2], that you have?
(PERSON2) Well, maybe interesting information for Dominik.
I'm finishing training of a German ASR that may be used for time stamping.
I'm not sure how good it will be because I'm trying to do it on (Libry) Speech.
And, though, when I was downloading it, they claimed it had more than 600 hours.
But then the training said that the actual training set contained only around 300 hours.
And I'm still not sure whether these 300 hours do not contain similar sentences.
Or actually the same sentences but spoken by different speakers.
For example, in English or Czech I used to observe steeper conversions.
And now it won't convert so fast.
So, if we take some samples during the training.
Then there are still some serious errors in the ASR output.
So, I'm hopeful that for the time stamping, it is good enough.
Or at least we might try it.
(PERSON17) Okay, that's good, yeah.
So, I started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you reminded me, [PERSON8], that your profanity filtering is not yet integrated.
And I think this is also an important message for [PERSON5], who has disappeared again from the call.
So, the important message is that yes, it's very good that you are actively pushing so that your results are integrated, and everybody should do so.
And at the same time, we need to have the setup, so that you can actually integrate and test it yourself.
So, I call it "do-it-yourself integration".
So, [PERSON8], when working with [PERSON5] and when documenting what the setups are, make sure it is tested well enough by colleagues, such as [PERSON4] or even [PERSON9] for the language model checks and everybody else.
So, whenever someone develops a new useful component, the full pipeline should be accessible to him reasonably easily, so he can test it himself.
So, this do-it-yourself integration is important, because otherwise it will all remain on you, [PERSON8], and you don't want to be overloaded.
So, you want to provide these people with inputs and outputs as the first testing approach, which has already been done.
[PERSON4], right?
The profanity filtering, has it been tested on logs?
I think it was.
(PERSON8) Yeah, it was tested on logs, I think.
So, now it's time to test it on the live pipelines.
And again, I think it's better if [PERSON8] explains to [PERSON4] how to do it, so that [PERSON4] runs it for himself some of the workers and live playing some of the problematic file like using [PROJECT8] or whatever.
Simply play them.
Follow the sound output on your machine and see how that works.
Because only when doing the real setup will the true errors appear.
It is important to first debug it, using the log files, and then it's important to debug it in the pipeline.
And if this debugging can be done by the author of that component, here, in this case [PERSON4], it would be most efficient for all of us.
So, [PERSON8], please confirm that you agree with this idea of like do-it-yourself integration.
(PERSON17) Yeah, so for the multi-accent English.
So, we are now [PERSON14] putting that together to just one technical solution.
The current idea that [PERSON14] is working on is that he will create new sentences with words that were spoken in other sentences, and he will do this across different speakers.
So, it will be really multi-speaker sentences, and therefore the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved.
Ah, so that's one particle experiment.
And later on, we may do something more about the multi-accent thing.
So, these new sentences will actually try to solve two problems with one experiment.
One problem is the implicit language model.
So, the ASR system has to see the largest possible set of sentences.
And we are going to create new sentences from the text-only language model by adding the sound part to that, so that the language model will be better for the ASR, and the robustness to different speakers would be also better.
And in a talk yesterday, I heard another idea.
It was during the training.
They were dropping out time bands and frequency bands from the sound.
So, they were training on disrupted inputs, and that also greatly improved the robustness of the system.
(PERSON17) Anyone else can work on the non-native accent thing.
Ok, then another thing that I spotted is - this is in the Monday test document.
It is highlighted four times.
So, when some session is happening, we need the names and terminology for that session.
And we need to collect it, prepare it manually, create it somewhat.
And this manual creation should be supported with automatic tools as much as possible.
So, there is a certain skill b in that, which needs to be practiced.
So, I'm quite skilled at shuffling text files.
And whenever I see any of any of you doing that, then I like always have tips in my head of what could be done faster.
Maybe it is not faster for your end, but at least you should consider it.
So there this skill is something that that we need people to have.
And we need someone to be responsible for that.
And I'm afraid that the only person for this could be [PERSON8].
If you find anyone else who would be ready to help with the immediate domain adaptation, the data crunching, please say so.
And then we need -
So, once we have secured the dictionary of terms and whatever the word pronunciations, we need techniques to put these dictionaries to use in the systems.
So, my impression from the domain adaptation that [PERSON9] has been carefully doing for all the sessions was that it was not really visible in the hybrid ASR.
So, one such session is again going to happen this Monday.
[PERSON9] is already starting the data collection, but I would like to see the benefit of that domain adaptation in in in the [PROJECT5] set up.
So, maybe [PERSON9] and [PERSON8], because he's learning how to do domain adaptation and [PERSON14], because he is doing how to work with [PROJECT5].
If you three could meet and double check what is [PROJECT5] doing with the -
It's not [PROJECT5], actually, the domain adaptation is for the [PERSON18] toolkit, right.
So, this is kind of backward-looking, making sure that the old approach works.
At the moment it is absolutely impossible to do any domain adaptation for the fully neural ASR.
So, what I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting from sound and some merging procedure.
So, we could have two ASRs running at the same time.
End-to-end ASR, which is better in general.
And then domain-adapted [PROJECT5] setup, which is used only to spot the keywords.
And when we see a keyword in the domain-adapted version then we would then we would use that sentence from [PROJECT5], which is in general worse, but contains the right terms.
So that's my suggestion of what we could do.
And another suggestion is that we really should have our own fully neural ASR and do various experiments on finetuning and all that.
So, we have discussed this with [PERSON14].
And, [PERSON14], is there any update from the potential colleague or friend of yours?
(PERSON17) Yeah, so if there is anyone else who'd be curious about this please let me know or get in touch.
So, it's this is something which is which would really be accepted well in generally as a as a paper, because people don't do that yet.
And that's the most urgent problem these days.
So, we really could make an impact there.
(PERSON6) Yeah, I was maybe just thinking about like what kinds of data we currently use for this, because, for example, like if you check like [ORGANIZATION4]'s models on [ORGANIZATION5] that they are like already pretty good at these things -
(PERSON6) And I think that if we just like -
We could probably just get the data from them, because you have like a such a large set of videos basically with different domains and different speaker native languages on [ORGANIZATION5].
And I had this idea that we could just like use some tool to download basically some kinds of filtered videos from [ORGANIZATION5] and make training tests a training set out of them.
So, I plan to do it myself.
I plan to go there, but we need a backup person.
And also, for the [PROJEC210] event we need someone to take care of the recording,
So, the archiver person, so that we don't lose that session again.
And the more important and still persisting topic to work on is ladder climbing.
And I've suggested here in the paragraph for [PERSON2] that we could use simple html tables that would be autogenerated and that that would grow.
I think that that would be probably the easiest to just put up the tables as html, but it could get difficult when we want to see the differences, as new systems will be evaluated after every new evaluation campaign.
It may be difficult to prepare these tables.
So, I asked [PERSON7] and [PERSON7] unfortunately won't be available during this call.
To tell us whether [ORGANISATION242], which is a web-based solution.
Some start-up company which offers accounts for academic purposes for free.
If that would help us or not.
Okay, so [ORGANISATION242] is not recommended by [PERSON7].
So, simple html is probably the way to go.
So, as soon as [PERSON2] has these evaluations m cleaned up.
So, that means moving the few scripts to where they belong from [PROJECT3] test set and some automatic runner.
Then also please create a conversion from the tables into html similar to the tech conversion and then put these results regularly to your webpage.
Or what you could even do is to have a full git check out directly located in this public html or singling from that public html.
So that it would be immediately accessible through the web, and anybody could have a look at the current scorings and explore that.
So, this would be useful, especially for m people outside of [ORGANISATION2] such as, [ORGANISATION15].
We know they have like -
The performance was bad for some of the files, and they could directly m browse it on the web m.
They could also browse it actually in on [ORGANISATION101].
This is up to you to set it up so that it's user-friendly and easy to follow.
(PERSON2) Okay, I'll do that.
(PERSON11) Yeah, thanks.
I'm now working on, or getting to update, the demo paper submission, which is due next Friday, if I'm not mistaken.
And then I have some project reports to do and I'm starting to gather documents - like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, for the two sessions.
(PERSON11) <parallel_talk> For ASR as well we should add a complimentary metric -
Actually more, we should add complementary met- these complementary metrics. </parallel_talk>
So, you mentioned one and that is profanity filtering m evaluation.
So <parallel_talk> have an explicit list of things which must not appear in the output </parallel_talk>, right?
<parallel_talk> And then rare words evaluation.
And here have an explicit list of names and terms that we do want to appear in the output, scored not simply by (order) rate </parallel_talk> but scored by something which directly accounts these things, right?
Yes, so I totally agree.
This involves also manual preparation of the reference.
So, <parallel_talk> both need manually created references. </parallel_talk>
I have one remark from [PERSON1].
So <parallel_talk> [PERSON1] has compiled some translation dictionary.
And she should share it soon. </parallel_talk>
So, this could become an empty part of the second thing of the rare word -
So <parallel_talk> this would be the rare word evaluation for MT and then from [PROJEC210] we are also likely to get some dictionary. </parallel_talk>
So that would be the [PROJEC210] domain obviously.
And [PERSON2], could I ask you to revise the <unintelligible/> domain and create such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs.
So, like shortlisting - listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the <unintelligible/> domain.
Could you do that?
(PERSON11) It should be doable, so let's give it a try.
It would be like - it would be great if you managed to do that.
So, I'll write it down.
So, <parallel_talk> aiming towards [ORGANISATION62] deadline with subtitler study paper. </parallel_talk>
Yes <parallel_talk> and then then a multi-source with [PERSON7] or based upon [PERSON7] or - </parallel_talk>
And for the language ID, I'm curious how do you want to integrate it exactly because it already involves considering multiple ASR sources, multiple channels, so what would be the use case for the for the language ID?
How do we plug that in?
(PERSON13) It will be audio to text worker, and it will emit time stamps like for four or two second window and the class.
<unintelligible/> silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it in the pipeline.
(PERSON11) That is important.
Please write this down here into the documenter this <unintelligible/> summary, because that is for [PERSON2].
And also [PERSON2], when you talk to [PERSON10], well and also possibly [PERSON5].
If we have this tool, we need to (ship) the audio to multiple ASR or multiple workers <unintelligible/>
We will separately need to (ship) the audio to the English ASR, separately to the German ASR and the Czech ASR, for example depending on the <other_noise/>
And also, to this language ID worker and then we need to merge these outputs, and this is tool which we do not have yet.
That's the multi-source tool, which will be observing the text outputs and also following the time stamps and it would emit the - it would probably like produce the output into three separate language channels for using either silence or the correct ASR.
So, we need a filter for the ASRs, so that the ASR is silent if it's the wrong language and it is the recognized text if it's the correct language.
I just made it up this type of setup.
Another of setup would be that same sound is shipped to ASR and this language checker.
This language checker is essentially a part of the ASR, silencing the ASR if it's the wrong language.
That's also an option.
So, we need to figure out which way of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes.
So, please keep thinking about this like what are our pipelines.
Ideally, I think that the least like management confusion and so on would arise if our MT models were multilingual.
If they supported different source languages and they were translating from any of these languages into English.
Possibly doing just a copy, if the English was given as the input, so we would have multi-lingual multiple ASRs at the beginning.
All going into English, and then from the English will go into all of the languages.
And later when [PERSON12] would have multi-lingual model of ASR, that language ID would not even be needed.
(PERSON3) The thing is, as long as we do the analysis more properly, one thing is the possible adversarial evaluation, just to indicate that that the constraints are actually having an impact on the actual output.
That that would be nice and yeah possibly the attention analysis.
But I'm not sure it might give us the same answers, basically, if the if the model attends or does not attend to the constraint.
(PERSON4) I had to look just at a few examples of attention, I did not do any statistics or anything, and it looks at the constraints, and when it translates the constraints, it looks like the constraints given, and I think it would be useful if the system made any errors, but it in fact does not do any in that sense.
It makes some general translation errors but not the (phenomena) we are trying to solve.
Well, going back to the automatic evaluation, the problem with mismatch is that the output is correctly inflected, but the context is different.
Therefore, it is not the same word form as in reference, right?
(PERSON4) Yeah, but I have also checked if the contexts are valid translations and in most cases they are.
Like in the first 100 examples that were marked as error by automatic evaluation 91 of them were correctly inflected in correct contexts.
(PERSON4) And I think only two or three sentences were correctly inflected in the incorrect context, like the translation was wrong.
And then there are some cases where the translation was totally wrong, because the sentence was really wrong, and the part must be <unintelligible/>, but that was just like one or two cases.
(PERSON3) But you are trying to match the divert forms when you are evaluating it, right?
You do not do any-
(PERSON3) -lemmatization of the reference and the-
(PERSON4) Both, both, both, I'm matching both the surface forms and lemma.
(PERSON3) Oh I see, oh yeah, those are the two scores, right?
(PERSON4) It is just the dilemma score for the (European?) is not in the table because of the table like won't fit into the paper so <unintelligible/>
Coverage is always like 97 percent.
It just generates the correct lemmas, just-
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, okay, I get it, I get it.
So basically, the lemma coverage says whether the constraint is there, and the surface coverage difference suggests that it might be incorrectly inflected, but that is not the case.
(PERSON3) Oh yeah, just I do not know if you if you, if you catch <unintelligible/> when we were talking about [PERSON1],
but one thing, is, that, that the (blow) is better but the other thing is that the lemmas are actually properly inflected manually,
but that is that is another, no, no problem, it is actually good that is <unintelligible/> right, yeah.
So, I was thinking there might be.
But I'm not sure whether we have some test data for that, but we might try to play around with the models with some sort of style transfer?
As you know, we can use a constraint and try to use a synonymous constraint instead and see or compare how, how, what is the difference between the outputs.
But this is, like I'm just describing it vaguely because I myself do not have an exact idea how to do it, but it might have been an interesting, distinct scenario.
I do not know, [PERSON1], do you know about any style transfer data for English Czech? Do we have something?
(PERSON4) <unintelligible/>
(PERSON1) By style transfer, Dusan, you mean that there would be something which is in the written language, and you would be the target side, would be in the spoken language or something like that?
(PERSON3) Well, that is the thing like, I have only a limited knowledge about the task.
But I can imagine that you want to rewrite a sentence that it is not written by male, but it is written by a female instead or, I do not know, like you can have a scientific and unscientific explanation of certain phenomena.
I'm not really that familiar with the exact data sets and what they cover.
And the idea is that the style of the sentences gets quite vaguely defined.
So again, not so sure.
(PERSON1) We have this corpus of sentence transformations.
And one thing that is there and could be labelled as style transfer is for example, making the sentences more general.
So, details are omitted, the sentence is simplified, and then making the sentence sound colloquial.
Well, just a paraphrase.
And I'm not sure if we have anything like shortening of the sentence.
For shortening, Matous is doing some experiment with English–Czech, but we do not have any reference data there.
So, we do not have any sentence compression dataset.
So maybe the generalization could be of interest but I'm afraid that there are too many different good generalizations, so the single reference one would be too limited to tell you anything about the quality of your generalization.
And I'm not aware of any like gender transformations, for example, this could be done <unintelligible/> for Czech, so maybe the right person would be Rudolf Rosa to ask him if he has ever generated any such dataset.
So, there will be a root-based generation of some sentence counterpart.
(PERSON3) I guess that is actually like an interesting question whether we can use the constraints to enforce this kind of the like gender of the speaker in the in the translation.
(PERSON1) That is actually a very good idea.
So, we could focus on that and create a particular sub-part of [PROJECT1] test set that would cover that.
Ah so that we sometimes we know the gender of the speaker so if you are...  maybe I'll share the screen and browse that.
(PERSON8) Or I tried it with Marian just attending it and it's... I don't know how many BLEU points lower.
(PERSON2) Because like the way I believe Martin does his <unintelligible/> little translation, so he translates more sentences at once and then picks only the centre one and goes like this for the whole document.
So, the context is like in one <unintelligible/> together with sentence we actually want to translate.
(PERSON10) Yeah, I think - wasn't it Dominik doing some experiments with Ivana?
I think the last year or two years ago for double empty where they were attending the context or concatenating the context with input sentence and doing some sort of document level translation.
But the thing is with this with the concatenation is not completely sure whether it has the same effect as we do multi encoder setting-
(PERSON1) Like everybody is different, it's definitely a different calculation, different leader, but it's I'm surprised that [PERSON8] says that it doesn't work full stop.
(PERSON8) Yeah, okay, so sorry, maybe I should be more correct that it didn't work like in the way I did it <laugh/>
(PERSON1) Yeah, because I think it's a method which is very easy to test, and it always should be tested in contrast with the two encoders, and I would expect sometimes to be better and sometimes to be worse than the two encoders set up, depending on the exact task like what exactly is the second thing that you are encoding.
So, maybe if you have two copies two paraphrases of the same sentence,
maybe it is somehow confusing for the attention so whatever, I don't know.
Behaviour also could be different for the old sequence-to-sequence methods, compared to transformer, so for RNN then it behaved differently maybe with transformer it's yeah, it's harder to train so maybe you need to whatever increase warm-ups number, warm-up sets.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so just know like-
(PERSON8) I don't remember, so I don't remember exactly but this is like what-
when I started in summer with those multi-source experiments.
The first thing I started with was concatenating the paraphrase and source and maybe I, I don't remember now,
I can check it till the next meeting whether I tried also,
I definitely tried when the sources are on the first position then some delimiter and the paraphrase on the second position.
I might have also tried that I shuffled the two things randomly, yeah, and I just remember that it did abundantly this compenetration stuff and tried multi-encoders.
(PERSON8) And it was probably due to low scores.
(PERSON2) <unintelligible/> that you like can improve your amenity score by just appending phrase-based output and the attention is like double diagonal, so the attention is not an issue, so like I believe you but it's surprising that it didn't work.
(PERSON10) So, if you if you input the phrase-based output that's basically post editing, right? You can think about it as a postediting like you are postediting phrase-based output, right? Or like depends on the point of view, right?
(PERSON1) <unintelligible/> that you like fully to rewrite it but technically it fits exactly the postediting task, you can plug this as a solution to the postediting task.
(PERSON10) Okay, so one question just for me just to make sure in the concatenation settings you insert the sentence separator token, right?
You have a special token to distinguish like which is the source and which is the context or the other sentence or do you just concatenate them without anything?
And hope that the system learns it?
(PERSON8) I tried to, I guess two tokens and yeah like because in the first version, we had a suspicion that the token could be also tokenized itself, so then I replayed it with another token which is not only for this purpose because we used some pretrained dictionary, and this dictionary didn't contain separator tokens.
So, I used some token that I assumed that it wouldn't be like tokenized into several pieces and so it will appear once.
I had no guarantee that this token couldn't appear in other places in the sentence and that is the only place it could appear.
So, it could be done more properly, yeah, I agree.
(PERSON2) But the Flask part or the communication part with the client is something that I cannot do.
Because I have no experience and no time to get it running.
(PERSON1) I thought it meant something using I don't know mediator.
(PERSON2) No, make a HTTP client which can fill the queue and read from another queue.
And send the text back in a HTTP request.
Because my idea is that the user clicks be used in the Ukrainian project too.
(PERSON2) And my idea is that a client clicks this microphone button and starts to speak, and when the user is speaking, you send the audio in small chunks at the same time.
Let's say 200 or even 100 milliseconds.
And to the HTTP server put it to a queue which I will handle the queue later with (ASR).
And the model will do some logic, some inference with that.
And whenever it has a new piece of transcript, it will send it back, and the user should get the partial transcript back.
And it should be immediately displayed in the text field.
(PERSON1) I could think about that.
Just I don't really know Flask either, but yeah, I can think about that.
(PERSON2) Oh maybe a different HTTP server.
I don't know, maybe we don't even need a fancy HTTP server for that.
(PERSON1) I mean for text flow, we use something like Hypercore, but I'm not sure if that would work for this.
(PERSON2) Yeah, the only requirement is that it should handle more connection at a time.
(PERSON1) Well I think online text flow is something around 2 000 at least.
(PERSON1) I mean the script that I have in two different folders, and then will run it with the little different inside workers, so that I mean, yeah, so that I have <unintelligible/> let's say ten, well instead of an output, a file by a <unintelligible/> side worker, so <unintelligible/> that we have, so I'll just make sure that these things for a single file are getting generated parallelly from all the available workers.
(PERSON1) Oh that would save our time.
(PERSON7) Yeah, yeah, this is very important to parallelize everything actually, parallelize both the processing of the systems as well as the evaluation of the cell DF, because he would need to run this many times, there will be errors, you need to re-run this quickly.
(PERSON7) Okay, so thanks.
So, you are very busy with this, I don't want to put any other things on you, so let me start with the reminders.
We need to finish the description of [PROJECT1] desk set,
Who do we have here?
Oh well, not really, yeah, (it's done) and it's not here unfortunately.
So, this would be for [PERSON2],
Then the evaluation, this is for [PERSON1], but we have discussed this.
Listen, give me the table in DSD let's put the fine line here and push the template of the table, like the plan structure into the delebl now, so that the numbers will come later, but I want to see some numbers and the full structure of the table very soon.
(PERSON7) Okay, thank you.
We have [PERSON5], that's good.
So, for [PERSON5], I would like to check what is the progress in the evaluation of the systems, and whether you are in touch with [PERSON1] also for the evolution, which is more important.
Can you hear us, [PERSON5]?
(PERSON1) and then, we'll figure out which packages to install in the Petri environment.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so there's another thing,
Maybe it's not a good idea to combine these two runs into one setup.
I think it is actually better if you run it separately and save the outputs.
So, you first use the environment for cruise control and the processing,
(PERSON7) and you collect all the output files, and then you run the evaluation.
And the reason for this split is that you can paralyze more.
So, there will be problems on various fronts, I'm sure, and we will need the numbers very soon.
So, if for example, some of the test files will fail for some reason,
Then you can still keep the translation running for the remaining ones,
and re-evaluate, with a sel T F, the missing ones, and, and so on.
So, it's, the point is not to create a serial, sequential processing that includes both,
but the point is to get the results, and it's actually better to do it in slices.
First get all outputs, then we get all evaluations.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so, I mean, right now, I was doing the same.
(PERSON2) Yes, that's the only stuff I did for positive constraints.
With the negative constraints I did something a little bit more complicated in the decoding.
Like filtering out the beams and replacing the beams with different beams.
And for like multi-token constraints and this kind of stuff.
But for the positive constraints, I only compared the training approach with yeah just this very simple stuff.
Just modifying the scores in each step in the same way.
(PERSON7) Okay, so back to the positive constraints.
Were you already focusing on the analysis of the system?
(PERSON2) Yeah, right now, I'm kind of waiting for the dataset reprocessing from ([PERSON9]).
Also [PERSON9] I had a look at the (code), and I think I know why it's so slow.
Because for each entry in the terminology in the (Europar) reprocessing, you open the dataset, tokenize it, read it line by line, tokenize it line by line and then close it.
But you only you do that -
(PERSON4) So, I remember that for [PROJECT1] I was doing this from last year from some cottage in the mountains.
And I just realized, shortly before New Year’s Eve that I need to submit it.
And <laugh/> so this is also something that will happen to [PERSON8] I'm afraid that he could be...well, no party, but maybe at the remote party.
And then suddenly he would realize that he has to submit it.
So, there will be no review of like at that point. <laugh/>
He would simply take the PDF and upload it so. <laugh/>
(PERSON7) Well, okay.
So, Yeah, I will check on 21st, and otherwise I will send them an e-mail.
(PERSON4) Please, I think better send them an e-mail right now and just ask for that link in advance.
(PERSON7) Okay.
(PERSON4) Yep thanks.
(PERSON7) Do we have other issues to discuss today, or is that is that everything until the New Year?
(PERSON6) I hope there wasn’t anything for me?
(PERSON3) Several years ago.
MT marathons used to have this system or tool papers that were published as a special issue of PBML.
That was in the first year when that happened.
And then, in the subsequent years, it was integrated with normal like there were also PBML issues which mixed empty margin papers and separate papers because of the number of those papers.
And we even had a thing like if the paper was not good enough for the PBML, but if the tool was presented at the MT marathon.
The authors were invited to submit for another review for one for the next PBML issue.
So, we have, even as I said, your system, your tool is interesting.
Please publish it at the MT marathon among the people.
But your paper is too bad.
You need to improve it, and you will get only to the next PBML.
(PERSON4) Yes, but another possibility for SIGDial.
Isn't it possible that trying SIGDial we attract kind of better participants.
(PERSON3) That's yes, that is... like I thought that I also had, but I don't know either of the venues.
They have final paper registration in July.
So, the conference was in September, and the paper submission was in May.
Because for Interspeech, we could also like split it paper by paper.
So that some papers would go to the Interspeech proceedings.
And some of our submission papers would come later for the PBML proceedings.
And the authors would be free to choose.
So that we have to negotiate this with either SIGDial or Interspeech.
If it is okay for them to have some of our papers, given that these papers are submitted by the March deadline.
So, there is an absolute strict requirement.
And I think it's they cannot have anything against it.
Because if the paper is worth publishing.
Like, it's only a bonus that the paper has some shared task result appearing in the satellite event.
So yeah, I think it's okay.
So, we do not need to ask for a special session.
In Interspeech it is called special session, we don't want that.
In Interspeech we want the satellite event.
But we will tell our people.
If you manage to have your paper ready by the Interspeech deadline, send it as an Interspeech paper and you will have it within Interspeech.
Ah, if you do not, ah, do it for the Interspeech deadline, here is our deadline.
And that is for PBML.
(PERSON7) Ah, okay.
But the thing is like for Interspeech satellite event.
Erm, Interspeech like won't get into any proceedings.
(PERSON2) You can I think you can just you can just reserve the whole semester just for [PERSON9]'s courses and you will have a lot of work and no free time, even though you have just one subject.
But I think it's a different thing, because I think it's not really a thing to fail his courses.
Like to fail because you are unable to finish it.
Of course, like people are just giving up, but I mean it's maybe for different reason that just it's impossible to pass.
I think that it's definitely possible, but it's a lot of work.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I think that he told us in the beginning of the semester that well if we want a one (??) you'll get a one.
Just within the second deadline, you should submit it.
That's pretty much the only thing he asked.
But he also told us that judging by previous years' trends, a lot of people don't do that.
They find it easier to read for the exam.
No, sorry, study for the exam-
(PERSON2) Yeah because well in general, his exams are rather easy.
(PERSON2) So I wouldn't say it's super easy, because there are some courses where the exam is like fun.
(PERSON1) Oh well, one of them was yesterday for me.
(PERSON2) Yeah, when it has short context and because I make decisions based on very short context for this very low latency, then it really commits to something that in, for example, a second or two, it figures out oh, well, actually this was bad translation.
So, it tries to use a different wording.
To, for example, specify the thing.
So actually, I really liked it.
I like some of the translations. I was really amazed, even though you could see that the model made mistakes on its first try, it really wanted to make some kind of correction.
And it definitely sounded really fluent, which I think is also important.
If you really demand low latency, then then I think that even a slightly lower quality is fine, if the fluency is good.
Because if you have bad translation quality and bad fluency, then I think that the translation is just pointless.
But if the lower quality is because the translation, if you read everything that you will get the same information, but the wording is just poor, because it used, for example, more words and it used some corrections and stuff.
So, I think that this is completely fine for simultaneous, as long as you don't lose any information.
And for which language pairs do you have these results, like some examples?
Because I would like to look at it, just out of curiosity.
(PERSON2) Oh definitely, I can dump you my logs.
(PERSON7) But in which languages?
Because you know I don't speak German.
(PERSON2) English and German.
(PERSON7) Yeah, but I don't necessarily speak German <laugh/>.
(PERSON2) Then I can provide English–Chinese and English–Japanese if it helps <laugh/>.
(PERSON2) So again, I mean to make it humanly readable.
Because this flickering is really annoying and then you lose focus on what was actually said, because maybe this is also a question of someone who knows more about the human brain and how we work with information.
Sorry, I never thought about it in depth.
But I think that whenever I see a word, I put it into my memory and my memory is not a linear thing, but it's more like a bag.
So, I put a word into a bag.
And I like to connect the things in the bag to get the overall image of the word.
And I think that that's the problem with the flicker.
If you translate something and then you change it, then actually I read it already, it's in my brain.
And then I lose focus and control of what was actually then translated as correct and was not what was not.
So that's why I think that the whole flicker thing is bad and stupid by definition.
Like I see the motivation, like you want to display everything you have.
Even though you cannot promise it's good.
But I think that we cannot work with this extra information.
And I think that maybe the problem is that the systems are created by people working with it.
If I'm a developing a system, then I'm really crazy happy if I see that even if I don't promise the translation is correct, I still show it and it's somehow good, but I think that the developer is not really focusing on the content itself.
And how you perceive the content, but rather that, oh yeah, my system can output it really quickly.
And even though it just guesses the quality is okay-ish, I think maybe that's why the retranslation was created.
Just the developers of the systems are eager to display information, and I think that because we are limited in in like the vol e of information we can perceive some time, we like see the extra information is just an extra burden for us.
So, I think that it's not good to show extra.
Like if you want to decrease latency, then instead of flicker, just lower the quality.
I think that's still better than showing the flicker.
Because what would be the real use case?
Why would you need to see the unstable hypothesis, really?
Like from a user perspective?
(PERSON1) Like technically, when human translators start translating, I mean the goal even there is for annotators, they would try to follow the speech string of the original speaker.
So, there are times when they would say something, and that would be wrong, so they would just correct themselves.
(PERSON2) Well but yeah this means with my solution, like you would not do flicker, but you committed, like there is no way to change, but you correct yourself.
And that's actually what the translators are doing.
(PERSON3) I'm strongly feeling that our work is not exactly in the domain of speech, it is unhealthy.
Because there is no concept of speech here.
We are directly working on text.
But the thing is that the proposal for a statistical workshop this year is over, which was in September, which was too early for us.
And the next proposal would come for 2022, which would be too late for us.
It is better that if we get either of the two sectile or interspeech, because both of them are well recognized in the community.
We can motivate participants to submit.
Ah, the only the only caveat that I'm finding now is going with interspeech is like they won't allow us a space in the proceedings, which may deter some of the participants, I am not sure how much they will be excited to publish a paper in archive.
So, in archives, people can publish any time, right?
So that is not a benefit to their profiles.
So how to motivate participants to join our shared task.
So, this was the reason that I especially vouched for the special session.
But this time, the problem is, what I can understand is the last time, the time periods between proposals, submission and final paper submission was five months, so it would have been enough time for our schedule, but this time.
It is only three months.
So, I see this fair as an important possible source of non-native English speech that we can use to extend the test set.
So, I think we really should focus on the Clearest voice competition, and we can do the booth if we have to.
But I would like to limit that, because the dissemination into high school students is less of an impact for us.
It is more important to use it as a test session.
So, we should focus, [PERSON1], on the [PROJECT2] Clearest voice, and keeping the organizers happy so that we can do the data gathering there.
And do whatever they want us to do in exchange for that, and we need to check their plenary program, and what type of subtitling would be useful for that plenary program.
so that would make it a test session for us, and as for our own presence at this fair, I don't think it's too important.
So, if we are asked, if we are really expected to be there and present, then okay, but if not, then I think it's definitely good for us just to be behind the curtain and behind the scenes and do our job there.
(PERSON1) Yeah, I haven't tried to do the registration yet for that, but I think that last time, it was compulsory to have the booth.
(PERSON2) Yes. So, discuss with them what is needed so that they are happy, and they allow us to do the Clearest voice, which is the most important thing.
The test session is less of an urge.
And the booth is just something that we really could avoid, if possible.
I would have preferred them to join the sessions earlier than doing things like that.
So, we really need to practice these preparations.
With the online world, it seems that you simply j p into the session, and the work is done.
But that is not the case.
It always takes 30 minutes to get it running and properly connected.
So, we need to be there earlier.
And if some session that we are doing starts at nine, but the organizers meet at a quarter to nine.
Then we have to come at a quarter past eight already, so that we have the 30 minutes extra to make sure that everything is running and chase people.
So, this is a remark for everybody that for the management to work, please also anticipate what management might suddenly ask you to do, and that would help a little.
Another message that is very important is the recording of these important sessions.
I don't know if you have responded, I had not seen anyone providing any- any updates to the document.
Maybe I forgot to tell all of you.
I had a document about the experience from [PROJECT4]and [PROJECT5] 2020.
And the first point in this experience is that we were very bad at recording these sessions.
So, it's important for the purposes of further evaluation or analysis of what went wrong to have good recordings of these sessions.
And one aspect is to get the consents, to actually be allowed to do the recording.
And even if we try to get the consents in retrospect or whatever.
Then there is the technical aspect of the- of the recording.
And we have seen that this is so diverse and complex.
Yeah, [PERSON5] is sending that link.
I have sent it by email, I remember.
2 bad lemons in a row :(
I ordered from this company because I've bought it previous seasons and it worked great for us.
This season I bought the next size I needed.
One of the pajamas I received had a hole on the foot of the pajama.
I returned it and the company sent me a new one.
The replacement pajama my son wore one time, I put it in my washing machine just like always and the zipper broke off!
I'm so disappointed because I don't have time to be dealing with returns every few days and yet that is what is happening right now.
Just as described
This is a basic puffer coat.
If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations.
The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to "puff up" a bit.
I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me.
I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed.
However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine.
There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later.
The hood functions, but no ties on it.
The front zipper works.
There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room.
There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you).
There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT.
For the price, I think it is fine.
I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold.
I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign.
However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent).
Overall, I am pleased.
The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.
This is a very nice skirt.
The lacy pattern is classy and soft
This is a very nice skirt.
The lacy pattern is classy and soft.
It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool.
This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into.
I think this could be flattering on anyone.
I'm 5'5" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down.
Didn't work with my 1999 Buick LeSabre
Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed.
However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car.
The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob.
This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it.
There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.
Good Price for Replacement
The grill of my car was ripped off by a large something flying down the interstate so I needed a replacement.
I was afraid after reading some reviews that this wouldn't fit, but it was perfect!
I own a 2013 Corolla LE.
I didn't put it on myself--I had a guy at a body shop do it for me--but it looked really easy.
It just snapped right on in less than 5 minutes.
I gave it a 4 star for the sturdiness because it does seem pretty flimsy (time and flying debris will tell), but over all I'm very satisfied that my car no longer has a gaping maw on the front now and that the price was reasonable.
Needs improvement
Super awesome light My 5 year old absolutely loved this light It didn’t last long he got it for his birthday in January it’s February already has trouble with the buttons and doesn’t run bright with plug in eats up batteries even tried recharging batteries Super cool but needs improvement
Musical Start
The piano is great starters!
It finds your child’s inner artistic ability and musical talent.
It develops a good hand-eye coordination.
The piano isn’t only a play toy, but it actually works and allows your child to play music at an early age.
If you want your child to be a future pianist, you should try this product out!
Very worth the money!
I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes.
The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw.
I was pretty taken aback.
I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago.
Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week.
My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.
Someone screwed up the formula??
This is so weird.
In normal light it looks like I have a pink and an orange but under UV light they are the same!
I drew a pink line using a paint stick from another brand so you can see what pink should look like and know it's not just my camera.
Pink is my most used color so I'm a bit upset about this.
Red, orange, and pink are basically all orange.
No point in calling them red or pink.
The white isn't as bright as I would have hoped.
The rest of the colors are all great and I like how easily these paints wash off.
I just wits there were a pink.
I guess the purple will suffice.
works for the most part
I had bleached my whole head and then dyed over it with a black box dye a few months ago.
I then went and had highlights put in all over my head.
A few weeks later I put blue/green Arctic Fox hair dye on my hair and it would not fade out.
I used this stuff with Olaplex No. 3 and it lightened TREMENDOUSLY all over, removing the green and blue parts as well as lifting the dark box dye.
However, after a day I noticed a green tint to my hair.
Every day it gets worse and I have used the color extractor twice now, with the same results.
My hair is also getting darker where the box dye was.
This is a great product it just doesn't seem to last.
don't believe the hype
Too many five-star reviews on this novel need to be tempered by some more realistic assessments.
I tried reading it but I just found the language flat.
the "freshwater" metaphor and the many descriptions of the womb like a river and the baby like a fish seemed forced, hackneyed, and contrived.
I skipped ahead and it looked like all I was going to find was a campus drama.
I give this book 10 stars!
Excellent read!!
I absolutely loved the book!!
I’ve adopted 4 Siamese cats from Siri over the years and everyone of them were absolute loves.
Once you start to read this book, it’s hard to put down.
Funny, witty and very entertaining!!
Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!
I really Like this ring light!
It is wonderful for the price and it gets the job done!
The only issue is the light bulb heats up too fast and the light goes out, so I have to turn it off wait for a while then turn it back on.
I don't think that is supposed to happen...I don't know if I have a defective light or what, but it is a very nice ring light besides the overheating.
Confusing storyline
The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot.
Also the title doesn’t fit the story.
The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened.
I was confused at times and had to go back and re read a lot to make sure I didn’t miss anything.
Loved Collins...
It took a while to warm up to Grady
3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one.
It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her.
Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together.
Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed.
Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around.
While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves.
I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself?
To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms?
Was he delusional?!
Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc.
She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward.
I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent.
I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that.
Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her?
Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two.
She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened.
There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding.
He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end.
I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character.
The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part?
I adored, hence my rating.
If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.
He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors.
Regarding his portrayal of Churchill
Mr. Oldman has played and created many, different characters.
It is very difficult to tell it is him.
He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors.
Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done.
The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages...
The scenery and costumes were excellent.
Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position.
Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times
Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth!
I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017.
At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel.
I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel.
I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system.
March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect.
Every time I try, I get the error message.
Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit.
I followed the YouTube setup video with no success.
When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth).
Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone.
This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone!
I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection.
Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication.
I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.
Good, but would like to find something better
After a lot of research, I started using this product many years ago.
It had the least amount of harmful ingredients, and still worked okay.
However, it dries up so quickly that you end up using so much lube, which ends up costing a lot of money, as well as being too disruptive during sex.
I've just been too lazy to look for a new product, but will start looking for one that is both harmless, works well, and not too costly.
The battery life is terrible on the one I bought on Amazon.
Still can’t believe Logitech discontinued this remote, nothing else comes close in comparison.
I absolutely LOVE this Harmony remote, this is my 4th one.
Dog chewed up the first one, husband kneeled on the screen of the second one, and the third ones still working but there’s an elbow mark in the middle of the touch screen also courtesy of the hubby...bought this one as a back up and the screens great but the battery it came with holds a charge maybe for a couple days.
My original (3rd one) keeps a charge for weeks at a time and I use my remote for everything.
Broke in less than a week
I like the product it’s a nice size and color!
Unfortunately only had it a week and opened the one door and it cracked the top of the wood piece!
I’m really disappointed!
It’s all assembled and I don’t have the box anymore so how could I even think about sending it back?!
My husband did try and fix it with wood glue but sadly that didn’t work either!
The door popped right out again!!
Not too easy to assemble plus....
It’s a nice looking piece of furniture when assembled, but assembly was difficult.
Some of the letter markings were incorrectly marked so I had to try and figure out on my own The screws they supplied to attach the floor and side panels all cracked.
I had to go out and purchase corner brackets to make sure they stayed together.
Also the glass panel doors are out of line and don’t match evenly.
This alignment prevents one of the doors from staying closed as the magnet to keep the door closed is out of line.
Still haven’t figured out to align them.
BAD CODE PRINTED ON THE TOP OF THE POD
I purchased these in February.
Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine.
I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem.
Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box.
I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each.
I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message.
I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine.
It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue.
Very disappointing since my return window has expired.
UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money.
Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!
Sweetener on the go.
Such a convenience!
It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets!
I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend’s house.
While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea.
Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!
Doesn't actually do any air "cleaning"
Bought this as a humidifier, the "air cleaning" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something.
As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size.
The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks.
Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up.
It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type).
It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled.
However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great.
I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly.
My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here.
As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier.
tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.
I guess it was easier to break than they thought.
I am giving this product a 3 star do to the fact when I got it in it was broken already inside.
Once I examined it I realized whoever put it in the box put it in there broken, This could have either been the manufacturers packers or for the manufacturers sake the problem could possibly be that a buyer returned the item and claimed they just didn't want it or didn't need it and Amazon possibly did not do a good enough quality check when it came back.
In all fairness the buyer couldn't have said it was broken because then Amazon wouldn't have taken it back which is good especially with this kind of product either way though I am the one who got stuck with someones negligence.
I did however get my money back so after thinking about it and discussing it with my spouse I have decided to give this buyer another chance.
With that said I will only update my rating to a higher star depending on how customer service handles this post (by at least addressing it) and if the item comes in great shape, actually has the opportunity to do what it does, and works well doing what it is supposed to do.
Easy to install?????
Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install.
I tried installing both "bells" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck.
I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells.
Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working.
After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase.
The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work.
It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly.
It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want.
One thing they ask in rating this bell is how "weatherproof" it is.
I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.
Lost package - Re-Charged me
Grew up with these and was psyched to purchase them for my son, but they lost the package of live caterpillars.
They told me they'd replace it and charge half the shipping this time.
After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount.
I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher.
I spent 30 minutes on the phone so I caved and just bought another set of caterpillars.
Whatever.
Works well after some headaches.
Had some problems getting it to work.
The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery.
When I replaced cable with my own was able to charge and then connect the device via bluetooth to a PC.
Had trouble finding the PC software but when I emailed their support they responded within a day with the correct download info.
PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case).
The accuracy and stability of the unit look very good for my application, however I was not able to connect to either an iPhone or iPad (tried several of each) via bluetooth.
Will have to hard-wire if I decide to use this device in my product.
... was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold
I asked the seller if the color was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold, darker.
Nothing close!
The set looks VERY cheap.
It's super shiny yellow with lots of CZs, even shinier.
Looks great on the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.
Loved the ring - but couldn't wear it all the time! :(
This ring was beautiful.
I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable!
The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time.
I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing.
Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time.
This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry.
I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me.
:( Too bad because I really did love it!
So if you are purchasing this ring with the intent to wear it only occasionally, I say go for it!!
You won't be disappointed!
buy the Pampered Chef...
I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage.
I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies.
I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products.
Not this one.
At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working.
I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat.
So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop.
It's totally worth it!
Will not buy Mr. Coffee again
It was a fine coffee maker for a while, but there were always issues with it.
If you got water between the black plastic and metal on the carafe, it would leak and drain the water for days.
Then our plastic lever broke which allows the coffee to flow through the filter and into the carafe.
I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house.
It's great at making coffee and keeping it hot, but there are too many other issues with it to invest in it at the current price.
Must buy!!
I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great!
The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain.
I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars!
It was easy to clean and all came in wrapped individually which I found to be really organised and it calmed my soul lol love, love, LOVE the color and I would definitely buy this again for myself or for a loved one!
Might be good on a pole, but NOT as a hanging baffle or weather shield.
Shame on Audubon.
The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and "Make sure it is securely in place."
HOW???
It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind.
You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it.
It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug.
It is a complete PITA.
I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards.
(Let's face it; there's nothing like this which will actually "baffle" squirrels!)
I love many of the features of these lights
I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window.
I love many of the features of these lights.
Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow.
The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants.
I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights.
The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only.
I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself.
I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants.
The lights are small!
When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.
BEWARE...SMELL IS VERY BAD...CARD SLOTS TOO BIG!
When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD.
At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell.
It never went away, so I had to return it.
PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big.
The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out.
THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.
It’s very small..
Received the travel money belt and it a lot smaller than the pictures shows.
I wished I did not buy it and will still have to look for something larger.
Good umbrella, would buy it again if I had to
First off, I have to say the color is loveeeee.
A lot of things I order in purple always come too light, too kiddish, too weird, too neon-ish, what have you.
But this purple was deep and lush and I love it, the umbrella is sturdy and really good quality.
Probably best umbrella I’ve had.
Comes with a cover and while it may not have much functional use, it really keeps it looking sharp.
Packaging is terrible - received 3 damaged guitars
Very nice looking guitar.
Too bad the company does not know how to protect their product.
Don’t bother trying to receive one that is not damaged.
We returned 2 because of damages in shipping and the the 3rd one was damaged also.
Gave up.
They ship it in the soft thin case with one sheet of brown paper in a cardboard box.
No padding at all.
Cool concept!
Just needs some more improvements to make it a really awesome product
Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing.
I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests.
I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch.
It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone.
For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder.
Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out.
There's no music in the mic itself though.
It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic.
Or you can even sync your Spotify app.
Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately.
The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!)
and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room.
Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic.
If you've figured this out, I'd love to know!
2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky.
I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker.
3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting.
If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.
Ribbed off by Vision Supplies
October 2017 purchased four (4) cartridges from Vision Supplies - Amazon Marketplace, so I would have when needed and to save shipping cost.
Used two over the last couple of years, about one a year, and they worked okay.
Tried to use one last week, almost empty after printing 20 labels, but in last one ran out after 40 pages.
The plastic a missing on both.
Told warranty expired!!!!
Who would check every single cartridge when received????
BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm sorry, what?
My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk.
I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable.
You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell?
Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this.
You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell.
My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries.
I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough.
I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients.
I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.
Drops internet
I bought this modem/router about two years ago.
At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I’ve had problems with it dropping the internet.
This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired.
The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset.
This was happening once or twice a day.
Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level.
Same problem.
The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem.
Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions.
I had to do a factory reset to restore this.
I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences.
I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router.
It’s fantastic.
I’v Had it for over a week with no problems.
It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris.
I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast.
If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router.
Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.
but it happens enough to be annoying.
On a positive note
1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box.
The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on.
Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point.
The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times...
They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying.
On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop.
Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.
Ok case with serious limitations
This case is ok, but not exceptional - a 3.5 or 4 max.
The issue is there are fewer cases available for the Tab A 10.1 w S pen.
Of those the Gumdrop is about the best, but it has some serious issues.
The case rubber (silicone, whatever) is very smooth and slick, and doesn't give you a lot of confidence when hold the Tab with one hand.
The Tab A is heavy so if your laying down watching a video the case slips in your hand so you have to make frequent adjustments.
I had to remove the clear plastic shield that covers the screen because it impaired the touch screen operation.
This affected the strength of the 1-piece plastic frame the surrounds the Tab A, so now the rubber outer cover feels really flexible and flimsy.
Lastly, they made it difficult to get to the S pen.
The S pen is in the back bottom right hand corner of the Tab A, and they made the little rubber flap that protects corner swing backwards for access to the S pen.
This means in order to get the S pen out, the flap has to swing out 180 degrees.
This is really awkward and hard to do with one hand.
This case does a good job protecting my Tab A, but with these serious design flaws I can't recommend it unless you have an S pen, then you don't have much choice.
Everything I needed
This product is really slick - one stop shopping for all my connectivity needs.
I love just throwing this and my laptops tiny power adapter in my go bag and being prepared to work on a big 4k display or grab photos from my camera.
The only odd thing I experienced (and I’ve experienced this on all 4 usb-c hubs I’ve tried from different brands) is that mac’s apparently can’t tell the difference between multiples of the same monitor (so my mac outputs the same video to all identical monitors connected to the hub whether by HDMI and/or VGA).
But if I use 2 separate hubs/adapters or 2 different models of monitor then the mac properly outputs to the displays individually.
Ok, needs some improvement.
A decent training tool but it really needs to have some sort of Safety Lock over the shock button( been pressed more on accident when it's in my pocket then I've actually intended to use it) my dogs even accidentally zapped herself after stepping on the remote.
Also if your dog likes to roll around in raccoon poop like mine does it is such a pain in the butt to clean.
As the fecal matter gets in between the cracks of the device requiring you to disassemble the entire thing to clean it properly and get the smell out.
Also the range is a bit inconsistent.
I've noticed you almost need line of sight for it to work.
And there have been times where it has not functioned at all even though I'm only 30 feet away from my dog.
Being rechargeable is certainly a nice feature and the charge does last for a good while.
I only need to charge mine about once every two weeks.
You get what you pay for.
Horrible product, misrepresented
I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it.
First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual.
Second, it doesn't come with a charger.
Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer.
Fine, we have lots of those around.
When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out.
I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges.
Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed.
Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning.
I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later.
Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...
Great backpack but overkill on the straps
This backpack looks good and performs well.
It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days.
The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps.
There’s more straps on this bag than I can count.
I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag.
Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college.
There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided.
The flag also is a great finish to it
My dog hasnt destroyed it yet
Have had probs with Hockey Balls.
My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float.
That is until she chews them to bits.
Tried several, even the "hot weather" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others.
Until these showed up.
These have stood the test.
My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews.
Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog.
Thumbs up from Daisy and I.
This product is hazardous to children.
This is a huge health hazard to your baby.
We checked the battery after a couple weeks of use and saw that water went into the compartment where the batteries go.
The batteries themselves had rotted and a black liquid was coming out of them.
Looking at the design, it appears that theres no way the battery enclosure could be waterproof meaning not only did water go into the compartment during bathtime, some of that toxic material came out as well.
Please do not buy this product.
I’m shocked that it was allowed to go to market despite such an obvious flaw.
overheating issues and hard time connecting controller
Im giving it 3 stars for now, i don't want leave a bad review for the seller unless he deserves it but this drone overheats a lot.
Im not sure if i should contact the seller or dji tello themselves but ill probably try both just to see what they say.
I like the drone is a cool little toy that fly's better than some bigger older drones and some of my bigger drones feel more like a toy than this one.
However its the only drone i have ever had overheating issues with and it actually takes the fun out of flying im going to assume for now that its a manufacturing issue which they need to address asap if they want there product to be successful.
I really hope the seller did not send me a use drone as i paid for a new one.
I will give the sellers props for delivery as it arrive 1 day after purchase.
I will update date my review after contacting seller and dji tello.
I only have good things to say about this gift bag
I only have good things to say about this gift bag set.
I was able to wrap all of my Christmas gifts with the bags, gift wrap and tissue paper.
The product is great quality and the different size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for every gift!
I highly recommend it.
The seller is absolutely sweet and attentive.
He reached out to me after my purchase to make sure I was happy with my product.
5 stars all the way around!
The physics are terrible and the people that created the game won't do anything about it
Don't buy this game the physics are terrible and I am so mad at this game because probably there are about 40 hackers on every single game and the game.
Don't doesn't even do anything about it you know they just let the hackers do whatever they want and then they do know that the game is terrible but they're doing absolutely nothing about it and the game keeps on doing updates about their characters really what they should be updating is the physics because it's terrible don't buy this game the physics are terrible and mechanics are terrible the people that obviously the people that built this game was high or something because it's one of the worst games I've honestly ever played in my life I would rather play Pixel Games in this crap it's one of the worst games don't buy
Not like other tomb raider games
From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games.
Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren’t smart in knowing what direction you’re trying to take.
Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways.
Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense.
I have not enjoyed this game.
I do not plan on finishing it.
The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.
Ergonomic and affordable, but not very tolerant of constant use
It has a slimmer design shape that fits better in the hands, there are no sharp corners to snag on and with the power cord as a permanent attachment, it's far less prone to damage than the original XB1 controller.
The downsides are: 1) The vibration effect that is triggered in action gaming feels much weaker.
2) The controller's directional joystick and buttons wear out very quickly.
We are very heavy handed and tend to wear out 2-3 controllers per year.
So for us, making investments in controllers yearly means we have to be picky and prudent about what we purchase.
The controller could do with more durable springs; after a couple months, buttons that are used the most stop responding and the right joystick loses it's centering, IE- makes map screens zoom in and characters walk forwards without even touching the controls.
You get what you pay for
I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic.
It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap.
For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me.
I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it.
I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that.
However, it you can overlook that, then it might be right for you.
It was packaged well and did arrive quickly.
Nothing like the previous Stylo phones, MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.
I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus.
Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it.
Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and "in the loop" and I did.
Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves.
When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that.
This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful.
I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account.
I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone.
I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit.
I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone.
Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST.
On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.
My favorite Obama quote: “Michael and I also want to… uh… acknowledge… uh… uh… uh… your son Jack, who deployed today.”
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.
I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best games ever that I have played!
But I have some problems…
I’d always heard of Mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple of months ago, and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists right now.
Anyway, those were just my thoughts.
Happy New Year’s everyone!
I hope the new year treats you well.
Now for this one, it’s kind of hard, because the enemies are so cool for this game, but... If I had to choose, I’d say I like the clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not the only enemy in the game that doesn’t have a single other variation from what I remember.
Honestly, I wasn’t going to make one, but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I disagree with a lot of others’ lists.
Not to say that my list is right, because this is all subjective anyway, which is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
Yay!
In my opinion, Lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind I’ve only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of episode 3).
Unlike her father, Lily tries to work with Lee and for the most part the group.
She does what she has to.
She is a bit of a bitch, because she has to.
I only have 1 problem with Lily.
She killed Carly.
If you could get Ben to confess…
Yes, I got spoiled on that and a few other things.
Ben is useless.
He is what looks like a college student, yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7.
Please don’t downvote me into oblivion if I missed something.
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats.
So 4 isn’t really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kind of sucks in my opinion.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who has lived both as a woman and as a man.
(Not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
So that’s kind of neat in my opinion.
I don’t think he did the role justice.
I feel before Neo figured it out, the way he was speaking was ok, but after… in my opinion, he should have gone full Hugo Weaving speech.
I just wanted to share my opinion not being a United fan, on the game against Burnley.
(Not that many of you will care).
McTominay - sheesh, what a guy.
I thought that Shaw was solid.
Now you’ve got two good left backs in good form.
Also I wanted to say AWB had a much better game, I thought.
After the shitty games and Dalot playing well I personally thought AWB improved a lot.
Haha.
Oh my god, it’s terribly funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can only drop at 4-6,
Yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues, but for me I can live with those issues but not this.
Please change!
It’s kind of an odd question in my opinion, but I have a ball python who I just got to eat frozen/thawed for the first time (yay!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I’ve tried frozen/thawed large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
It could be a fluke though.
I know it’s like a meme or something of “Dark Souls player complains about the combat” or something similar, but I just don’t get the combat.
I can do DS3 Deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately.
I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.
Oh my God!
Why do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they don’t have any idea of how a torrent even works (it’s so damn easy though!).
Comments like “The link doesn’t work”, rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
You’re just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤 Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So I get tipped on the app, they gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the application after?
What the fuck is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before, but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was less than the app tip...
If you are tipping both, tip both.
Not going to lie, Teamfight Tactics is a good mode, but it’s like Hearthstone a good game to play on your phone, not something to grind out all day all night, like what the fuck?
It’s not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on, prep up and alt tab until it’s next time you can do anything).
Any thoughts?
I know it’s a scientific things and all, but some of the posts there are just too much.
Learning dream languages?
What the fuck?
And some bloke is saying “I tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didn’t lucid dream?!” every few hours.
Maybe the posts are just getting a little too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like “Dear lord, what the fuck is happening, ooh”.
So I am a first time cup user, and I got the Saalt cup at Target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today, and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold + 17 year-old virgin = ow).
I got it in with the 7-fold, and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how the fuck am I supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails?
In one way, it kind of helped me find the cup lowkey grip, but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping.
I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes.
Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop).
Then I walked back and forgot my groceries.
I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill.
I live on a hill. Down. In the middle, really.
I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco.
So I walked back and got them.
No crime round these parts.
Not much, anyway.
I didn’t think about nails...
Is he going to tell her?
If so how would that conversation go down?!
Okay, what the fuck! Arlo now knows Sera (I don’t know how to spell her full name) is John’s weakness.
First of all, we’ve seen they are greedy as fuck (OK, not as much other mobile studios, but still).
Second, the game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high-end phones).
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
What the fuck are you Yanks on?

I’m never moving to canada.
Sometimes it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me the fuck out and gives me nods similar to codeine.
Why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with whether or not a woman looks at me and thinks I’m ugly.
If that happens, I get anxious from it.
But if a women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks I’m decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
What the fuck is going on?
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisible, even if they don’t detect you, they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I should’ve just grabbed a submachine gun and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many tries, most of them being on his second phase.
His 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7th place on the last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead of 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Because I have less than 3000 points.
(I need 55 Magaki frags and I get 50 - just feel my suffering)
Also in another event with gamer764 I have around 8000 points and got 4th place and got rewards for 4th place, not for 1st.
What is it with needing 7k points or more?
Are the developers too greedy?
I hope the title makes sense.
I have a list of names “john.baker” (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 columns “john” and “baker”.
Thanks!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were going to see each other, and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday, and so I canceled it, and now she won’t stop saying sorry that’s not what she meant.
What the fuck do I do?
I told her I was going on another one next month (lie) to make her feel better, but I didn’t.
But I don’t necessarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks!
Okay, so I’ve got less than a chapter left in Gardens of the Moon and I still can’t understand what the fuck Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I’m missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots.
You all are whack.
What the fuck! I posted a literal anime foot and still didn’t even make most controversial post of the day, let alone of all time.
So huh, you can’t alpha Karthus ult?
What the fuck is this bullshit?
It would be very helpful if all of you original posters out there actually said what the fuck it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it!
Such as “now I understand why this [brand name] thing has everyone going crazy”…
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn’t mean much to me.
If it’s too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever at the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the “DFW teams are cursed” camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me too much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential what the fuck transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a PC, but in the meantime I’m using a crappy 13-year-old PC.
I got money for Rust, bought it and it took 4 hours to download, 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server.
After I hit a tree with my rock, my game crashed.
At this time it was 12:47 am and I just said fuck it and went to bed ready for a whole lot of shit today.
EM opens the door: May I help you?
Me: Yes! Why did you give your kid permission to enter my house without my permission?
EM: GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.
GT pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
My girlfriend’s face just turned red, because the treasure he found was her dildo.
My girlfriend snatches that out of GT’s hand.
GF: This isn’t meant for kids.
GT: But it’s mine - I found it and finders keepers.
EM: Give him back his treasure.
Me: Why the fuck are you not watching your son, EM, because he has embarrassed my girlfriend and entered my home without permission.
I have to break up the format “xxx.yyy” into two separate columns “xxx” and “yyy”.
Stop!
Me: Yes, ma’am.
EM: What are you listening to?
Me: Better Off Dead from Josh A.
EM: What?!
EK: mom, stop!
Me: Bett-
EM: I heard you. What is that cover? *points to album cover*
Me: Oh, I think that’s a reference to cu-
EM: *cuts me off again* to satanic ritual.
Me: No, not at all.
EK: Mom, please stop!
EM: No, EK, this is a bad man.
EM (to me): Now give me your phone.
It was at this moment I knew this was a entitled parent.
Me: No.
EM: But my EK needs it. He’s got his degree.
EK: Mom, I’m 10.
Me: *coughs* Damn!
EM: How dare you swear in front of my son?
Yes, she said that damn was a cuss.
Me: Damn is not a cuss word.
She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot and cold.
Now she’s on to another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state.
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago, we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind of disrespectful to the new boyfriend, huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd.
However, I will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her, but I can’t think of a reason why I should…
After going “uh no?”, she sends me a picture of said candle holder from her kitchen.
I of course go “what the fuck, you’re home?”, and it turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So I’m beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
TLDR: sickly narcisstic mom went into hospital for 3 days.
I find out she’s home because of a candle holder.
It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is that I let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message I sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful because of a song I made that I was sharing.
I was very flirtatious, maybe more so than I was with my girlfriend when I was first talking to her, and that has been echoing in my girlfriend’s mind.
It’s been extremely difficult for her.
We have two dogs now.
I was hoping us having two puppies to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again, because we have them to bond over, but she still can’t say “I love you too”.
She doesn’t accept when I try to give her compliments, because I’ve said rude things in the past when I used to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games, but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you, but I don’t see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trimming my nails, wearing Versace Crystal Noir and other fragrances etc., which I believe is the reason why most girls, even if they’re taken, at least are willing to have a conversation with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self-development, and even though I’ve been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, I never let it get me down and I’m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women, even though I may not have Hollywood good looks or charisma like Will Smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and I wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :-)
She’s 18 inches long and weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
I’m just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champion every 4-5 days and she’s already longer than some males get, so I’m curious!
The anime is about a main character that’s in a game, but she doesn’t realise it, but the system says she’s dead and etc.
I would like to watch the rest of it, so please help me.
Looking for an anime.
I don’t know if to others it’s strange, but to me it was.
I got Covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so I had to tell my mum.
I could’ve just lied and said it was because of sharing cups or kissing a girl, since I’m bi-sexual, but I knew my parents would be accepting...
So I told them as it was.
My mum was very disappointed, because she thought she knew me well, and though I told her everything, but now she couldn’t trust me anymore, because blah blah blah…
Basically, he was very disappointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that I didn’t feel like telling her, because it’s private to me... until today.
She doesn’t really trust me like before, but she’s ok, lol.
Today it’s my birthday, so I’m sharing my “strange” coming out story.
I am confused.
What’s going on, lol?
This is my first time with SFU e-mail.
After the semester I haven’t touched anything school-related until today heh, so I don’t know how to fix this.
So me and my friend started playing Valorant again and want us to learn communications such as heaven and all of that.
Now I know what heaven is, but I don’t know others, and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If you’re still confused, I’ll give a scenario: “I hit the Jett, she’s in heaven”, like the location.
She’s an awesome cook, does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but she’s not a good cook either, lol.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well.
She can’t be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or it’s a guy)
She’s all nice and sweet to everyone else, but she’s just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong (not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it., which is wrong.
When she is there, she doesn’t do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren’t there.
The worst part about it is that people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The “false advertising” on the A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill, where it says multiple buffs can’t co-exist.
Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this is all dumb and also kills a lot of people’s excitement.
I don’t like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star, lol.
It’s just like Zhongli.
He was fine, but everyone freaked, because he wasn’t doing enough to dumpster content and was balanced.
I’ve seen lots of people in the fandom make rude or racist comments about Liberty and it’s disgusting.
Please leave her alone.
And you do realize she’s black?
Stop making fun of the actors’ ethnic features.
It’s honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general.
It’s not even funny.
Honestly, it’s just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And it’s not even just Liberty. I’ve seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmy’s hair.
(Also moderators, please don’t take this down.
I really want people to see it, and I have done nothing wrong.
I’ve been having some of my posts randomly deleted for no reason)
(As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guacamole.)
She then told me we gave her less meat, when I brought back the same plate without guacamole.
She’s home for the first time!
She’s finally back!
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my puppy in her crate at night, because if I don’t she will poop on the floor.
So there’s already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then I have work, which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my Corgi in my bathroom at this time, because if I don’t, she will reek havoc unsupervised.
Am I the asshole for starting a fight with an old friend (strong swearing)?
Even better for me it would be:
It would be an unbelievable loss to let a broken and thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest apologies for bumping straight into a noble that half-marched in his drunken stupor down the sidewalk, straight out of a liquor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the main street makes in a month, I was invited to finish the wasted goods, lest they spoil any further.
“Yes sir! May the heavens cry before your merciful heart!”
“Now get lost! This is no place for disease-ridden vermin like you.”
“Of course my lord!”
I ran back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and further out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on Snapchat with my friend.
Me and my friend were arguing as a “joke” and then she said she preferred older guys, and my friend was (M14), and I said I’m a year older than you, and she says “what I mean by older guys, I mean aged 17” and it hurt my heart.
TLDR: My crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and I’m 16 and she’s 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here, but I don’t know if I am the butthole or entitled one this story.
This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.
I sent a direct message to the artist I wanted, but nothing for 2 months.
Like yeah, I understand they are booked for summer tattoos, but at least say “Hey I am booked for the rest of ____”.
But I was like “ok, well I am going to look at another artist’s work from this shop that does small tattoos.”
Same thing happens: no answer.
So me and my brother decide “ok, let’s go to the shop and ask, then we will at least get a answer”.
We go, and this young girl attends to us. Let’s call her Brenda.
I told her everything.
Brenda said “well you can do the tattoo with me”.
I said “I’ll be back. I’ll think about it”.
I got back in the car and scrolled through her work.
It was good work, so I went back and told her “yeah let’s do this”.
I signed everything.
She didn’t even ask for ID, which I found weird, because I had gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on.
I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.
She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.
I was like “ok, great, thanks!”
4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.
The right side of the heart was smaller then the other side, and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again.
So I reset it, and yeah oops, I was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn’t dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry, and like through text she kind of sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if she’s mad, and like she said she’s only a bit let down.
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me, and like I apologized to her and she said its alright.
Then I just told her I’m going to sleep, and she just left my message on delivered and, like, she didn’t reply until today.
How to tell whether she’s mad at me or just annoyed, because right now I’m really confused?
Would I be the asshole if I was just a bigger sarcastic asshole to another asshole?
Her tumors are beginning to open through her skin, she won’t jump, painkillers don’t help, she ate a lot yesterday but won’t eat or drink today, she hid most the day, but... it’s hard, because she’s alert.
It feels wrong, because she looks at me like “I love you.
I’m happy you’re here with me.”
But the vet said she wasn’t even supposed to live this long, and the tumors will only get worse, and even if we had done chemotherapy, it would have only prolonged it.
My friend told my girlfriend something.
She then broke up with me.
I don’t know what to do now, because she and the ex-friend were the only people that I had.
What should I do to try and regain my relationship, because she’s helped me through a lot over our 2 years of dating?
TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me because of something someone said, and I want to regain my relationship with my girlfriend.
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee, because she’s a person of color with tattoos and “fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up, because I need to protect my staff, but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex loves kids.
She was playing Captain Save a Hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman’s situation with this girl’s “crazy” baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in each other’s life.
It hasn’t even been two months!
I’m so hurt.
She never wanted to build a life with me.
I knew she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, as soon as he saw that I was weeping, answered,  “Come with me.”
Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.
Entering, he led me with him on the bounds of a great circle itself encircling a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land covered with lava pyramids, with sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life save for those imprisoned in it, who, though they surrounded us, dared not approach for fear of the master.
As my ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, cries, and explosions that made the eternal air tremble, caused by slaughter, starvation, withering, and frief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, of men, women, and children.
They’ve grown out to the point they look kind of awkward, and she’s saying I should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something I’d like better?
Aah!
She said she might have some clothes that fit me.
I’m dying!
She’s so supportive and nice, oh my God!
So, it’s 0:34 the first of January while posting this, and my sister (F14) just ruined my New Year by calling my mum fat and telling her she’s a drinker when she poured herself a glass of champagne, which she only does on her birthday on Christmas Eve and on New year.
Now my parents are pissed off, my grandparents are pissed off, and my sister thinks she was funny.
The same thing happened on Christmas Eve, and now the whole feeling of New Year is gone and I hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sorry for my spelling.
Screw INTJ’s.
Why have they got to be good at everything?
It was a mistake getting the booster the day before New Year’s.
I feel like absolute dog water.
Literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and I almost cried 🙏
I’m so happy, bro.
She’s so cool.
I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :-)
Also, happy New Year’s Eve and happy New Year everyone!
First of all, the satisfaction I get from saying I am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
A high I’ll never come off of.
Second of all, a customer comes in for the second time, mad because I didn’t do copies from a book because of copyright.
She goes “well, I called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
And I’m like ??, ma’am it’s in our policy.
I don’t care what customer service says.
She keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy”.
Like, lol, not when you act rude like that.
Our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and she’s such a cuddly, loving, little girl and I love her cuddles every night and in the morning.
I’m just scared that she isn’t going to be like that after she gets fixed.
Am I overthinking it?
Do you think since she’s in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she’ll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I don’t fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently she’s been asking me if I’ll fart in front of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and it’s weird she’s never heard me do it.
I can’t believe she saying I’m depressed looking while she’s such a shy girl and weird thinking she’s not.
So delusional.
I hate it, but they are my only friends.
She’s calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to D2 after several year, now I’m wondering:
Where do you guys sell or buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or is there a website that’s more efficient?
My friends are mean and delusional.
One is immature and shy and always pulling me down.
The other is fine, just jealous, and it’s getting on my nerves.
What to do?
This is a setup I can live with.
My boyfriend’s and my fear however is that in a few years when we’re ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own boyfriend.
I’m very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow any more pushing of the boundaries.
What do I do here?
Boundary Issues with my boyfriend’s alter.
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was up-front when we met and said she’s shit at texting, and has apologised when we were speaking for slow replies, something to which I said “don’t worry, I know you’re busy!”
The conversation seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation.
However, I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread), but she’s viewed my story and posted a story since.
It was New Year’s Eve.
So I was all ready for the New Year actually thinking positive and the changes I’m going to make, etc.
Then I see he’s posted a picture of them both that she’s taken saying “love of my life”.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face!
Ex’s boyfriend posted a picture of them :-(
Every time I ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even though she’s older, what the fuck?) and that I shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her.
She drains the life out of me.
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently I’ve been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, I could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brought herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to separate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later, we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great.
I’m so happy.
In our anniversary month, what do I see on his phone Snapchat?
I look at it again, I see Jane, but this time I can look at their conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So I just got my first bearded dragon.
He’s only a month old, and like most new owners, I’m worried about if he or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day, but so far I’ve only been able to feed him about 6-7 crickets.
I’ve tried feeding him some vegetables too, but the guy doesn’t show any interest in them.
Is there anything I’m doing wrong or is he just fine and I’m overly worried?
Then I found out about this really cool website called Complex.
They’re sort of like journalism but better, since they’re all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through Complex.
Before, I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic, but Travis Scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
Now I like Tame Impala, and I’ve started dressing weirder, I bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully I’ll wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromises himself/herself on social media?
Is it just me cringing at the Twitter posts by Albatross?
Everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
He’s making it seem like XVG is a sinking ship at the moment, and it’s doing fine.
So I have this friend in real life.
Man, the dude is known everywhere.
He’s got a solid reputation on the streets, in the jails. Everywhere this guy goes, everyone knows him.
He was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on Reddit, because I feel like I’m not really known.
How do you get hella karma?
I’m 21, he’s about to be 23.
My issue is that he seems to have no ambition anymore.
He doesn’t work and doesn’t make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an EMT.
He failed it the first time by 2 points, and I think he fears failure so he doesn’t really want to try anything anymore.
He’s been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
I’ve gotten Super Smough about 5 times, but I always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear I’m far enough away, but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
I’m using a 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helms and naked (even with tattered armor it doesn’t seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know by throwing myself at them enough times I’ll get them, but it’s slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do, but I seem to always get caught in a dumb combination or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or notice the letter I put in there, and now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you you read this sentence wrong too?
Well, now that I have your attention!
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :-)
19/F Aw shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time.
If I just want to make Draven my 1 carry, how should I do it?
I know he’s a good unit, but what items can turn him into a god?
I tried healing sword and rapid fire cannon, but I get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character.
However, his shield’s gun is overpowered and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets that’s fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate, because it got absorbed.
I don’t know about other players’ opinions, but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so he’s not overpowered enough to counter everything.
Tell me what you people think.
I didn’t think anything of it, so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him, the entitled kid started screaming “Mommy, he stole my cookies!”
At first I was startled.
I started to get nervous, and I froze.
Then entitled parent walks up and starts yelling “Give those cookies back to my daughter! Give them back!”
And I did not know what to say at first, but then something came to mind: just say “but I didn’t.”
But the way I said it was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That’s when my dad noticed (he’s old — sad he didn’t realise a little bit earlier)
He called a manager to the scene, and the manager told us to continue and he’ll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We’re both xxx majors (I’m a dual xxx and yyy major while she’s a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn’t say I’m smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I’m a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (she will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
It’s not until my next billing cycle that I noticed something was off.
I was a bit lower than normal and I keep a very close eye on my expenses.
I looked over my bank statements and there it was:
My new Prime bill.
I was super confused and got hold of Amazon’s customer support.
They helped me as much as they could, but because I was receiving my service through the phone company, I would have to go though them and figure out the problem.
The next day that I had off, I walked in and talked to a very sweet girl, who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kind of talked in circles for a bit as I tried to explain what the Amazon customer service told me.
We looked me up in their system and there I was: 2 lines, but no Prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date I opened my first line and then the second.
Both dates added up to what I had told her before.
She stared at the computer screen for a while with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tomorrow I’m no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach out all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered, it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance, and he messaged me on Friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said I didn’t change anything.
After that part of the conversation ended, I asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
He said that he’s good when he doesn’t think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him, etc.
Day 1 of no contact starts tomorrow.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster.
We used my name and I’ll credit his Instagram below.
He’s a good guy.
I’m glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and our story.
Would you guys like either homemade lore or not?
I couldn’t post this on the Fallout Reddit for some reason.
It wouldn’t let me put the photo.
I hope it’s good, guys!
Is it even possible for ITSOKTOCRY to blow up outside of the 3 songs he’s had do extremely well?
Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for a while, and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much I despise griefers, because they don’t just destroy something in a game, they destroy hours of work, and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying I’m mean if I don’t go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non-stop how I’m “mean” or a “bad person”, because I’m busy doing something so I can’t go give him his shit.
Well, I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I don’t see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy.
We do get slightly tipsy, you know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a Facebook message saying he’s ready for her to leave (she’d been there 2 hours at this point) and then he starts passive-aggressive cleaning in front of us.
He’s going through a divorce so he keeps telling me that’s taking all his money.
I didn’t give him a title as I didn’t even get one when I bought it.
It was salvaged from some guys at a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale, but I’ve long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do you think it’s not worth it?
Also, if I did want to how, would I?
So I just told this guy in my class, who was also weird as fuck and gave it to him saying “oof, I sat on it. It broke. Do you just want it?”
He’s like “no, ew”.
I have OCD and immediately got ashamed and was like “lol, why’s it gross?
It’s the same as a whole one (and along that line), like, lol, why?”, and he was like “ok, oof, it’s not” and I’m like “lol, why did you say that?”
I was saying it jokingly, but I’m afraid I looked weird.
Like what the fuck?
Why’s she upset or playfully upset that I don’t want it.
My human staff comes home tasting of sausages and cheese.
I think she has another fluff she is making treats for.
Should I be sad or angry?
What does your human taste of when they come home?
I can tell where your human has been and what they do by taste when they come back?
Anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday I finally mustered up the courage to message him.
Me: Hey, how’s everything?
Him: It’s been a long time.
Me: Sorry about last year.
I was super awkward around you, lol.
Him: lol, no, don’t worry about it.
*drum roll please*
Me: To be honest, I liked you blah blah blah…
Him: Haha, you could’ve just told me!
Next time you see me just say hi.
Do you still go to <school>?
I’m not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn’t sit well with me.
Hey guys, I just wanted to share this helpful application with you all :-D.
It’s not that I am trying to promote this application or something.
It really helped me a lot.
That’s why I thought it might even help you guys out.
I’ve seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team OVRs, and many are thinking to buy players, but can’t decide which will boost their team OVRs the most.
This application helps to calculate the OVR of your team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people (F2P players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team OVR since it will result in a huge loss of coins (because of 10% EA tax).
What’s the recommended amount of dedicated RAM I should have to server?
If you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.
You should be asleep.
Go to bed, I say.
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Star Butterfly.
She had blond hair, blue eyes and a super cute and colorful dress.
And she had a magic wand!
One day she got kicked out of Mewny (her home dimension) by her mean mom >:-( just because she made a mistake.
So she had to go to Earth.
On Earth, there was a boy named Marco Diaz.
He liked safety and he was super handsome.
Everybody at school was in love with him!
(Except for that idiot Jackie)
So anyway, Star came to the principal’s office.
He was like “Star, this is Marco. He’s your guide.”
Star looked at Marco and she was shocked.
“Wow, you’re so hot.”
“lol, thank you” he said, blushing, and he winked.
“Let me show you around the school.”
“Ok”, said Star.
So they walked around school and they became friends.
“Ok, since you’re my best friend now, I should probably tell you who I am”, said Star.
“I’m a magic princess”.
Then she took out her wand and created 667 laser puppies!
I have a question for this Reddit.
Can you provide honest answers?
I currently have a custom build PC with i7 3770k 32g@1666 RAM and single GTX 1080 GPU.
Should I get a second one for 650 euros or wait for what upcoming years will bring?
GTX 1080 SLI or save money for 11th generation Nvidia xx80 TI GPU?
I know a lot about Jailbreak.
Should I make a Jailbreak?
How many likes can a thoughtless post get as long as I like Telecaster? :l.
If you don’t upvote post you hate Telecasters and should die.
Thanks, ok.
I love Telecasters.
We should rename August to October, because he wasn’t released in August.
I’m out, boys :-)
I bought GTA4 for Steam PC and it won’t work.
It worked fine for a small year on Windows 7, and now my PC has Windows 10 and it won’t work.
I made Social Club and Games for Windows Live accounts, but it won’t work even with accounts.
It won’t work even for single player.
It won’t work after the people on screen wait in the loading screen.
Then suddenly when the game should start, it just closes the window and that’s it.
So how make it work ?
How do we get them to know they should use it?
The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse...
I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty.
I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens.
I want to own freedom...
How do we change the landscape?
What are your thoughts?
Sorry for my English being bad.
I should buy up that limited time bike for Halloween before it disappears next week.
Inside your body, deep beneath your skin, muscles, and not beneath your organs, lurks 1 (one) skeleton.
Spooky!
But wait, it gets worse.
The skeleton inside you doesn’t even pay rent!
He/she lives in your body so he/she should pay rent!
They freeload off you and don’t even do shit for you.
So you should evict your spooky boy.
Happy Halloween!
Edit: I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it has!
Thanks for the 6 upvotes!
Just small information, I’m 5’9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k, but I really can’t hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical “you should be good, but you’re not, so I’m going to give you unrealistic goals”, or should I be at 1:49?
My head hurts when I go krumping heads with other boys!
Green lighting things go all over the place too!
What should I do, doctors?!
Right, so I’ve fixed my headaches!
I’ve had to throw up some burny green stuff!
The boss says I should do that more on the battle, the place we’ve been fighting in!
I’ve got a metal stick for my trouble too!
This poem went as follows:
> My name is frog,
> I like to play,
> Out in the rain,
> All night and day.
> My skin is green,
> My face is coy,
> You look and say,
> Here comes that boy.
This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Aren’t you all tired of seeing at least the first two jumping into battle and wiping out your whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying that if they weren’t here then, well, the game would be balanced.
Well, I beg to differ, because there’s Akai with his insane disruption and Diggie with his timely ult or maybe even Irithel might be banned because of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly, the king and queen of this game are Lancelot and his beloved Fanny.
You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is.
She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo. You be a good girl!”
She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak.
Haha!
Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what?
Haha!
She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl!
You left the steak alone!”
And that is the story of me being a good girl.
Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt.
She says she is dumb not to think of that.
Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers.
Now I obviously can’t get out and shut it on the main road, so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I’ve quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothing’s happened.
My bed smells like disease.
I should probably wash it.
Please send me some tips and stuff on what to teach him.
Currently he’s doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns, because that’s the only gun he gets kills from.
I already taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
By the way, this is coming from an Iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say I should be silver and some even say platinum, because I carried a gold player).
Do you know how some motherfuckers exist?
They literally get close to you, then all of a sudden you have problems, and even though you apologize again and again and again, no it’s never enough for them.
I was in a Google Meet, but I told them I’d be back in 10.
I forgot my phone so I went to get it, and guess what, them speaking about you and backstabbing you.
You seriously don’t know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
Maybe I am overthinking, but I’d rather die alone than live among these kind of people.
Maybe I should just ignore them?
Or should I give them another chance?
Or maybe I am just weird, lol.
l have developed feelings for my best friend.
Now, the question is: should l tell her how l feel about her?
Will this affect our relationship that we have?
How will she take it?
I’ve been waiting for two years now, savings from then and I barely made 200 USD until now.
I’m still studying, and gaming is my dream… and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness from life… to be honest…
What should I get?
A monitor or a GPU…?
Some of you are so lucky to get a GPU for free on here… lol…
Am I the asshole? Me (31F) asked my kids dad (43M) to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in the kids’ room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not meant to lift too much or stretch but felt OK and thought I could do it alone.
I can’t.
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of the walls where I can’t reach.
He said yes and today came to do it.
After a bit, he said he was done and leaving.
I gave him £20 and said how grateful I am for the help.
I checked the room once he left...
Both kids’ beds were full of torn off wallpaper, drawers cracked where he stood on them.
I’ve still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent the last 45 minutes picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds.
Am I the asshole if I confront him about the mess or should I let it go and not bother asking in future?
My boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when I ask dumb questions (for example, I didn’t know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard? Just fill it”.
So I tried to do it but I failed.
Later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?”
Then when I do it myself and don’t ask him he goes “why don’t you ask me? I can teach you or help you”, but I refrain from asking, because he gets frustrated.
The last couple of calls had arguments, as he got mad, because I beat his ass in video games (even though gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked about him to lots of my real life friends, and they all ask why I continue to be his friend, and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only people who actively tries to interact with him online.
Yeah I know, my shoes don’t match.
They match the graffiti though!
I’m trying a lot of different styles, so let me know what I should change.
Hat: Sicko by Ian Conner
Shoes: Nike
Everything else is thrifted.
Ok, so I swallowed a small piece of box (?) tape as I was trying to bite it off with my teeth, and then I feel it in my ear 😭 not ear but that hole in my throat that leads to the ear. It’s just stuck there, oh my God 😭😭😭
What should I do, lol?
I don’t remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida, there’s a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100 times longer than when it’s not making a sound.
I’d describe it as that trademark desert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff, and … it’s just dude what…? Heck, it’s weird.
So maybe it’s both a sort of a paradox (life is), but I just want to know, honestly, did anyone else feel it?
I want a logical explanation please, and if one doesn’t exist, well I mean, because long before… I was “of age” so to speak… for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate, because I don’t drink, but I’ve…hmm… I’m an adult, let’s put it like that.
There’s other stuff out there, but long before that, me and my family saw a UFO.
Even my stepdad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been, and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall and, like… it doesn’t really scare me, because I think it’s the way life is.
Things change.
They don’t always have to make sense, and others say that too.
Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling:
> The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.
And so the North Wind was obliged to confer that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm autumn moon.
Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you yet again, creating chaos.
Who would win?
Please give a detailed explanation.
Ares (Greek mythology) vs. Mars (Roman mythology) vs. Svetovid (Slavic mythology) vs. Odin (Norse mythology) vs. The Big Bang (Atheistic mythology).
I am very ready.
I am very good.
I would like to apply for village idiot.
Should I get Horizon Zero Dawn or ELEX, because they are the same price right now, so what should I buy?
I’m just looking for reason.
By the way, I like open world a lot and shooters, e.g. Skyrim, Battlefield, COD, Ark Survival Evolved.
So any ideas on what I should be?
By the way, I would prefer them really quick.
Thanks in advance.
Thanks for the suggestions guys.
We are going to try to get the AK-477, because someone said it would help, but where do we find it?!
Please help with it.
We can’t do it alone :-)
I reside in Hyderabad, India, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in computer science.
I am a Canadian citizen, but for enrolment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam.
Now, the doubt that has arisen is… would my admission be considered international or domestic?
On a side note, how hard is it to be admitted to UoT’s computer science program?
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
I would prefer a hardcore clan with a plan. With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal or target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It’s not a necessity, but it would be nice.
PM me if you’re interested!
By the way, it’s my first post on this subreddit, so I might not have gotten it all down correct.
Locusts, grasshoppers, etc. can shut the hell up.
I’ve literally heard people tell me they learnt then forgot the entire Japanese language through anime.
I live in a house with a single mother whose first language is Thai and I barely heard English until I was like 4.
She would speak in Thai to me yet I don’t know any Thai.
You can’t learn Japanese though anime.
In fact I watched anime in Thai dubbed as a child.
I don’t fucking know shit.
Fools thinking they are out here saying “konnichiwa” in style, I’m contacting the authorities.
Here’s a question for you.
So you know the Panzer, Blue Gitz, the Tau or whatever?
So I, being a Mek, notice that they’ve got tanks and stuff that are flying, right, but they’ve not go the flames coming from whatever thrusters keep them in the air.
And they don’t make the beautiful roar that thrusters make.
I figure some commando would want a flying truck that doesn’t make a noise.
It’s a good market strategy.
Anyway, the question: “how do I krump gravity without a sound?”
Construction: teleport to house, for when they work on making player-owned houses useful, this would be godly to have.
Heck! Even now, player-owned houses has a permanent dummy for adrenaline building, prayer altar, and if they make it like Old School RuneScape, where you can teleport outside any player-owned house portal, this cape would be used a lot.
Hitpoints: Heal from regeneration ability increased, current perk I doubt would be used at either bossing or slayer.
This one is used at slayer at least.
I got one of my annual minds.com token ads in my mail today (I of course unsubscribed as soon as I found the option) and thought “hey, what the heck, let’s make a visit on the supposedly “alternative Facebook” that I just recently got denied for having a “non-believable name” and waiting further ID specification before I can use it again.”
And so I did and found out on the 2nd or 3rd post that The AJ Show has been blocked on YouTube,
I’m not a fan of rightwing stuff and was actually the reason I stopped watching it 2 years ago, though the small fragrance of freedom was that hard to find among the 90% national-capitalism the site has to offer, but anyhow, I got the idea of a non-censoring video site like LiveLeak but much more simple and less “newsy” that anyone can post on. No content would be removed ❤️
Hi guys.
I’m at 1500 hours right now, and my instructor still doesn’t let me solo.
I think I’m doing my manoeuvres ok, but the instructor says I still need more practice. I’ve tried my manoeuvres on a flight simulator, and my friend captain says that I should stop sending him videos of me playing GTA on my computer at 1 in the morning, although I trained hard on my flight manoeuvres.
What should I do?
I’m literally crying and shaking right now.
My friend would never do that :-(
Why don’t they make like Sesame Street for the kids, yo?
Like, it is very educational, I think kids would learn a lot from it.
I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras.
I have some questions and hope someone can help answer.
1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc.
Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about?
2. Is there enough parking for the second car?
3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to?
4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ?
It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place...
I appreciate any advice I get.
Bones says something like “switchblade on my waist don’t test”, and it was old young teenage bones, and the beat was hella mellow.
I would really appreciate this.
Finally it’s giving me an internet connection, but the only problem is, it’s so slow.
It’s capable of loading like Google, but anything else just times out.
And for some reason I can’t access my router admin page.
Really weird.
It’s just a white screen or it times out loading it, or the page becomes unresponsive!
Help would be appreciated, thank you!
Hey all, so today I was in the group chat with friends, and like four of them were roasting the fuck out of me, and at first it was funny, then my ego and self-respect got crippled after building it up for a couple days.
Haha, fun.
Yes, I know I am lonely and won’t get a girlfriend, but you don’t need to be jerk like that, haha.
I’ve searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
They could even go woah eee ahh ahh/oh eee ahh.
The possibilities are endless and I know it’s hard.
I’m just wondering if anyone knows it, thanks!
Hi there, it’s good to see you again!
*sits down*
How have you been?
*cuts a potato with my sacrificial dagger*
Wow, that’s great to hear.
*adds 12kg of salt*
Hm, there we go.
*throws a handful over my left shoulder for the devil*
Ok good, let’s eat.
*removes a small flask from my jacket and pours blood from it onto my plate in a small thick puddle*
Haha, that’s the good stuff right there.
*chomp chomp*
Do you want some? No?
Ok good *eats a spoonful of salt*
Oh! This is crunchy.
*chews and spits out bones*
Huh *licks lips*
Welp, that was wonderful, I’m pooped.
*gets up*
Thanks for having me over!
*transforms into a bat and flies away*
I’m feeling sad, but it’s okay I guess. Because medicines will help help us all.
Thank you, have a good morning and good night and good evening Truman show, haha.
Just kidding.
It’s going to be just as shitty if not worse than last year.
All these skin mods and such, how’s it being done?
I’d like to try it.
Is it player-side only?
Mods? How are people modding Battlefront 2 or is it Photoshop?
Hi, I was wondering whether or not it is worth dropping some money on pets.
Like, I saw how much some people can spend on them to get good results (like T4), and I wouldn’t want to spend that much :-D.
Currently, I have 5 T1 pets, and I wouldn’t mind seeing some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping “just” $100 would be worth it.
Is it worth dropping $100 on pets?
Towards the end of senior year and that summer, I don’t know what happened, but I got a hot body and my face was all “girl, you’ve been through some shit. Have a gift”, so now I’m pretty.
I just made a post on a different subreddit about having a nice date today, which is nice, but I am very hesitant on making friends and stuff because of the last two years.
So like, after my glow up or whatever, more people started talking to me, yeah.
And a lot of boys did too!
I never really had very many friends, so this was a huge yay!
The first boy I hung out with was really nice, but then we got high and I did very regrettable things I do not like.
Well, that boy was super happy and told lots of boys.
I don’t want to jinx it and call them out by name, but I’m talking with a company and I’m hoping it works out!
I’m excited about all things I’ll be able to do with these free promo products to help other people and possibly get them off some or all of their Rx drugs!
I’m excited for myself, because I have a bunch of medical issues that I do not use Rx drugs for and the other stuff I buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others, and it will help this company as well.
I’m ready, I’m ready!
I’m hella excited!
I might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do: my plant’s now way too small for its age in my opinion and has started to grow pistils.
Should I chop and restart or…?
I will be posting more here once I get… comfortable again.
(Self-love is important!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through - will get to them when I can :-)
In the meantime, Happy New Year!
P.S. I don’t have a Snapchat and don’t take any money, I just like to show off, you know, closet slut things :-) lol
Talk to you later, everyone!
He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.
I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No. You’re fucked up now.
What’s going on?”
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says “good lord, what the fuck happened?
I’ve got to garden.
Talk to you later”.
He read my reply, which said “I’m so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it, and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated”.
I just don’t know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him, and he will always be my first, and I’ll always talk to him and care for him, but I don’t want to be held in limbo.
I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know whenever I say “talk to you later” or “good night” or whatever I want to add an “I love you”. Just casually. To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day, just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten-fold.
I know sometimes I daydream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
It makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
To be honest, I kind of hope it is, because I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof, is it hitting me hard!
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I (I will takes days or a week to respond), but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to at the moment.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick “talk to you later” either to be honest.
Finally they seem to want to engage with me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then on the day.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on, and it’s not like we’re really talking, so I just block them.
I don’t know, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival.
I’m still “Ocean Serene”, but maybe I’m... I don’t know, that’s a tough thing to say, I never thought that my girlfriend was just a random.
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said a lot of things, I’m gonna agree that if I change, the world changes.
The advice you get, it’s always iffy.
I want to speak for everyone, but at the same time I can only speak for myself.
Also, I went to get some rum and coke.
I got coke and a few other people saw it, so they bought some coke… erm, I hope my friends are ok (that’s all you weirdos I’m talking about).
Random story I know.
To be honest, I’m not ok, but I’m surviving like usual.
Actually I’m all just a bit right and fine. Talk to you later.
Talk to you later.
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, it’s 8 hours to [redacted], 7 to [redacted].
Not a big deal.
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles, an hour’s drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] I suppose [redacted] or [redacted]’s wife ratted me out.
Maybe I should block them too.
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house, and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you, and we can see how well that went.
[me] Shit. Betrayal.
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self-gratification.
I was in a toxic relationship for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our relationship, we were great.
One day, both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
I’m going to admit that sometimes when I feel jealous, I just want her to reassure me like how I reassure her that it’s all good, but she will only reassure me once and then said “bye” or “talk to you later”.
Most of the time in an argument, it’s always my fault.
She won’t admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight won’t continue anymore.
And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”
And he said “Yeah, well I’ve got to go. I’m doing something”, and I was going to type “alright, talk to you later”, but I realized we aren’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the conversation started.
But once he said he’s doing something, my heart dropped.
Like, what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him, but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doens’t like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now, I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he wants to do that.
If he doesn’t want to talk to me, he can just fucking tell me.
I don’t know what else to put besides that I hate the current circumstance of  life I live in.
I’m going to give a little insight tomorrow.
Ok, I lied.
I have to reveal my age tomorrow, because if I don’t, it’ll mess up the story.
Um, I don’t know what to type so I’ll type a worry I have.
Um, I don’t think I’ll get the tape gun in time.
Ok bye, talk to you later everyone.
She said something like “but I want to make sure that we go as a friend?” thing and I was like “okay, I know”, and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said “of course I like my long time boyfriend”.
Yeah, whatever, right, haha.
And here’s my question...
Yesterday when I was at work, she messaged me saying something like “how’s your work doing?”, and I kind of replied to her with a cold tone saying “I’m at work, talk to you later”, and then she, kind of upset: “Okay, I mean I understand you are at work so busy, but you didn’t cut me off like this before; so I kind of get it that you don’t want to talk anymore like before.
Got it!
Bye!”
How do you get destiny delicacies?
I’ve seen a few people have them, but I’ve never got one.
I don’t know where you get them.
If anyone knows, it would be a lot of help :-)
And my machine fucking freezes up.
It’s been happening for like 2 days now...
This machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3D scanner, but 4 browser tabs on Reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% of my damn memory and 60% of my CPU power and freezes the whole damn thing up.
Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint! Seriously, what the fuck are you developers doing?
Stop, please!
If you think it’s rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying “got to go, I’ll talk to you later”, then it’s also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one-off.
Things happen.
Maybe something came up and you got distracted, etc.
But every single person ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It’s really not that hard to just say “got to go, I’ll text you later” or “so-and-so just got home, talk to you later”.
Even just “bye” or “be right back” or something!
Today I got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if I did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn’t want to ignore them just to talk to me.
I said it wouldn’t be a problem if he had just said something like “I can’t talk right now” or “I’m with my friends, talk to you later” or just literally anything.
He then said I was overthinking stuff and I should “chill out”, so I left it at that.
So am I the asshole and overthinking things?
Am I the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend after he ignored me for a few days?
So I would usually post this on r/keto, but that subreddit is so intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But, like, a girl’s got to rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
I have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere, I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, calories please”.
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their “no cheat days” mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten-free dairy-free carbohydrate dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
As far I as I know, the concept of mini-album is only around in K-pop (maybe I-pop?).
I’m always disappointed when a long-awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5-song album.
I can tolerate a debut album, since you really don’t have a lot of material, but if you’re SNSD or something and you come out with mini after a years long hiatus like Mr.Mr, it’s kind of insulting.
I don’t know what to say, lol.
I’m pretty funny, not only because I manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often, but also because I’m just fucking hilarious to be honest.
I’m from Yorkshire, and that probably makes me cooler than you, because the North is just superior, and I’m ready to die on this hill, but I guess we can be mates.
I would really like some of those.
Ok, I’m running out of people to laugh at my jokes.
17M from the UK,
Please be able to hold a conversation, lol.
I don’t know what kind of dog this was, but it was so ugly.
My god, who would own such a thing?
Dogs with wrinkles like Pugs, Shar Peis (I don’t know how to spell it), Bulldogs, Boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all; I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally been told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness and over the nose, they can’t breathe)
And yes, I know I’m going to get shit on by all the fucking neckbeards on Reddit that just adore their snot nose little Pug.
I don’t even care.
I’m so tired of people and their dogs.
Every time I listen to him, shit makes so much sense, even though I don’t know what he is talking about.
That leads me to believe that either that guy is a genius who can articulate what’s going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something.
I mean what should I listen to if I really want to find out the truth, if Schiff is just “biased toward gold”, and that’s the reason why he is so hard on the current economy, etc.
Are boobs nice? Because, I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before.
Then he checks the oil level, saying that the oil also smells like gasoline, that gasoline and oil are mixing up together.
He opens one spark plug, sees the massive leak in there literally full up.
Let me say, oil smells like gasoline.
I didn’t smell that one.
That’s what the worker told me.
Then he call his boss, and the boss says it is not gasoline, it is just oil, “that shit smells like gasoline” 🤦🏾‍♂️
Even the worker confirmed that I’m not crazy, but ay, maybe I am.
And his worker told me he was going to seal the black thing that goes on top of the spark plug that covers it.
Sorry, my English is not that amazing.
He said he was putting a seal after draining the oil as he mentioned.
As oil drained, the oil sealed the thing so oil doesn’t drip out of it and doesn’t drip to the floor.
But it didn’t help me find the cause of why oil is getting into the spark plug, because a seal on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️
He tells me if the problem keeps on, it is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way too much oil and is causing the oil leak, that if the problems persist I will have to remove it.
Sorry for the long paragraph, but I need advice.
I need help to be honest.
My rabbit didn’t eat or drink, so I went to check him.
It’s been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food, I don’t know.
(He has constipation so I’m going to check if he poops.)
How do I sleep if I have to check on my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is going to become chaotic, lol.
I assume the time has already passed for this, but, I don’t know, I figured I may as well ask.
I kind of forgot I even had those tickets until they announced they’d be touring again today.
Now, my aunts (grandma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated grandma both before and after she passed.
When my grandma first started getting sick, my sister wasn’t the best, because she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but grandma was also scared of Covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job I couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back and forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
Would I be the asshole if I didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So I met this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dating.
Last night, everything was all right, she was happy said “good night” and “I love you” like every night.
And the next morning when I texted her good morning, she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad as fuck all day because of me but didn’t want to say why.
I don’t know what I did.
I did nothing.
What should I do?
How can I contact her?
Should I give her space?
My girlfriend blocked me, and I don’t know why.
Mine’s ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in which I have an F.
This is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I’ve done but are nowhere in the books,
This kind of snuck up on me, because I thought they were done and filed, only to check my grades and find out they weren’t.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you are going to say “I know right, I only have an 89, why couldn’t she round up? Fuck my life)
I’m going to be honest, that’s not very helpful right now.
So first off, Bard top.
What a pick, I know right?
Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like.
*my core is static/ie/RFC.
Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way.
I like to safely clear and lay out poke.
Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer.
Giving some more tank…
Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain.
I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade.
This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great.
If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy.
I’m tet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years, we’re both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It’s driving me crazy, how to deal with it?
This wouldn’t be an issue if all your servers asked at the beginning “do you guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.”
Also, why restaurants have to be set up like that? Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Hey guys, Bard main.
I just joined Reddit after finding out there are other off-meta Bards!
So I main him top.
Yes, it’s scary, but I do.
So I’ve been getting a lot of questions about my builds from friends and happy on-lookers lately!
I thought I’d share my builds!
I’m 16 years old, 5’9.
I’m new to basketball and I’d like to ask for drills I can do by myself so I can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I don’t have a decent shot nor a decent handle,
I could barely reach the backboard plus I have no friends so don’t even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why I wanted to be good at it so bad is because I just want people to know me as somebody, because right now I’m a nobody,
I want to be somebody.
P.S. I’ve never played an actual basketball ever in my life… I know, right?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising, you know) but pretty chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when I want to be), goofy, a little chaotic, big overthinker kind of deal.
Enneagram type 4, because apparently that matters (just kidding!).
I’m honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love... you get the gist :-)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist, so a program with medical school prerequisites would be preferable.
Plus, I plan to take my medical school abroad (wow, big dreams much?
I doubt I’d get in, but it wouldn’t hurt to try though).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me.
I’d be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh, and location too.
I’m short, so if my classes are far, I might as well rollerskate my way through campus, just kidding.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, you know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would’ve prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do.
The player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now, but I don’t know if I want to pursue her.
It’s complicated.
Right now its summer break, so I’m going to wait until school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person, because they don’t talk to me online, lol.
I don’t know how long this series will go, but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I don’t know how long this is going to take but probably quite a while.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I don’t have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say that if you’re a kid, like an elementary school kid and you’re here, where the fuck are your parents?
lol, never mind, fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Because I got them and no one to give them too, lmao, just kidding,  unless...
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium Sprite and a McDouble?
So I don’t know why I got on everyone’s nerves about the separate checks…
Hey, hi!
Haha... I’m new here, I didn’t know this existed until now.
I am extremely shy and don’t know what I’m doing here typing this, haha.
But hey, first time for everything right?
If we don’t click and you lose interest, then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry, lmao.
I don’t expect to get any messages, but hey, it’s worth a try.
P.S. I don’t know how to write these properly, so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format, oh my.
Oh and if I don’t reply soon, it might mean I’m asleep or playing DnD, hehe.
Never mind.
My internet is down right now.
Fuck.
Well I’m going to see if I can buy some stuff off Steam now...
Let’s hope there are still some good sales.
Okay, so I was a total noob and erased my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was going to use, but I sent Monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
Or how do you open the .key file?
Edit: never mind, I’m a complete noob.
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive Monero wallet seeds with a .keyfile?
user765123: No, I just had the “is now playing” thing show up.
A: I know.
A: Well, here we go.
A: “easily disturbed”, lol
A: Momma, help me.
A: Help me.
A: What’s the canon name?
user765123: ?
A: my name.
A: What’s the canon one?
user765123: There is none, pick whatever name you want.
A: Oh.
A: Am I a girl?
user765123: Male.
A: Argh.
<talking about their name here>
user765123: That seems like a good name.
user765123: lol
A: >:-)
user765123: (not that it really matters. I just used my real life name)
Comment
So I can guess your gender based on your post history.
Never mind… let me guess your gender instead.
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the professor is October 18.
(Edit: never mind, this part isn’t true, please disregard).
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is February 9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the professor that I’m dropping the course?
Do I also have to get permission?
I’m planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits by the way.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I really wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what?!” really loudly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “never mind”, because I felt like I was in the motherfucking spotlight.
But every time, my narcissistic mom says that it can’t be true, because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
“It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?”
Um, I don’t know, maybe it’s because we’re different people with different bodies?
To be honest, has anyone ever experienced fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn’t die and manage to kill a least one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch, but rampage didn’t pop his ult yet.
😲 What the fuck?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky as fuck fighter, and a carry that solos everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1
When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also.
I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in...
Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
Like now I feel guilty for smiling.
Never mind the fake ones shit, but fuck.
Haha. Ugh.
Why am I still alive?
lol, why the fuck does smiling hurt?
Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me.
I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible.
He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever.
I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions.
And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had.
I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting.
But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedely keep eating my food.
I do that for maybe 3 seconds.
Then I look back up.
Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds.
Edit: Yes, I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen. Useful, I know.
But ugh. They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
By the way, there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: never mind. I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance. Oops, now I’m not getting any MP!
Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!”
The message repeats every time I hit enter.
What the fuck!
I’m not cheating.
Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player.
10/10 I’m never playing again.
Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens.
I’m going to skip the Oscar-bait shit like The Post, because there’s only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Democrats making movies about how (extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) “politics used to be more polite. We need a return to the discourse.”
I’m sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas, but I’m just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns at the moment, but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior offensive line I think is a major problem, but there is no Nelson-like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there, that’s really the only situation where I absolutely stay put.
2 months ago, I bought a cheap ’95 Nissan truck.
I was only locally driving, so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn’t put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm.
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd only when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can’t rev it past 3k in my driveway without feeling like I’m going to break something,
I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it.
It’ll hit close to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule out what could be causing this power-sap, i.e. is it the air or fuel or a clogged cat or exhaust, etc. or something entirely different?
I ruled out “different”, I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone else’s narcissistic mom treat you like you’re overreacting about your period pains?
Hey! I read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangerous.
Is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2-month Boston Terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.
My friends think she said that because she was with her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up, etc.
Others think it’s a way for her to be evil, like think of me, because I’m never coming to get that charm.
I think it’s some type of hoover, good or bad.
Any insight is appreciated.
If you’re a woman, please tell me your perspective.
So confused, but she is clearly with someone else, and why couldn’t she call me back and why didn’t she respond to my text messages?
She could’ve said “I’m with my boyfriend, please don’t call me”, but she didn’t.
Just a side note: my boyfriend and I are buying a house.
We will be moving out in 2 months.
Once the papers are all finalized.
I have an Australian Shepherd, 9 months.
My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) got her at 3 months.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with, a black Labrador and a small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a Rat Terrier.
Their play style is boxing.
And one of my room mates (25M) has a Beagle.
He doesn’t like to play much.
In fact, he seems kind of scared too.
I know all of these things about my dog.
I know that it doesn’t matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise, doesn’t matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business.
What matters is that my dog is nervous.
So when I hold my hand out and tell you, “no, he’s not sitting or lying down because he’s calmly waiting for you to say hi, it’s because he’s nervous and insecure”,  I don’t mean it as a joke, and it’s not an invitation for you to say, “aw, well my dog/child is very friendly, so let me approach!”
I don’t care if your dog/child is friendly or “dog savvy”.
I don’t care if your dog “is just a puppy”.
(why the hell is that even relevant?
Is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies?).
I don’t care if your child is capable of not screeching “oh my God, a puppy”.
Can you, you know, do something about your child? And also your dog?
But with less than 3 months to go for that, I feel I’m not ready yet, but having never taken it, I have nothing to compare it to besides colleagues’ advice.
Without knowing what I know, they can’t know if I’m actually ready yet, but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this bad and it would be awesome to be done 6 months from my introductory exam.
I’m close... I just don’t know if I’m 2 months study close.
Some certified advice.
(M/5’10”/26/165-195lbs) 2 months progress, am I gaining too much weight?
I passed my FAA PPL written!
I know this sounds weird, but here’s my issue.
About 4 months ago, I had an 3700X which died after start, crashing when I tried to play games, and a day later not booting.
I sent to RMA, they confirmed the CPU was dead and gave my money back after 2 months.
After that I got an 3800X.
As soon as I tried, I got the boot code 7b, everything powered up but no reboots or video signal.
I sent to RMA this time with the store.
After 1 month they confirmed the CPU was faulty and sent me a new one.
I got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom (T) has always been the type where her feelings matter first and only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone else’s fault entirely.
For example: I needed someone to babysit our then 2-month-old for 3-4 hours.
Dad’s work had someone who had Covid.
We opted out of them watching our son and asked my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her before I set it all up, because I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its my fault and she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her days after the incident, because she didn’t call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing,
T promptly got off the phone.
I never got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to T’s narcissism.
I don’t expect an apology from T, because she never has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5 months, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2 months, he’s co-slept with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I’ve been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get a 2-month baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (currently replacing pacifier every hour).
First time mother to a sweet 2-month-old girl, and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
First time mother struggling with sleeps.
So I already have an orange golden chinchilla (Toto, 2 months old) and we have had Toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got Terri (2-month Himalayan Ragdoll) to keep each other company.
It’s only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor.
Just always going “brr rrr rrr”.
I’m not sure if she has a blocked nose, because Toto never made this kind of sound...
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
I can’t play until tomorrow but would like to know, so I can make money hunting or robbing everything and everyone.
How much do pelts sell for online?
Alright everyone, I think I mis-tagged this earlier, so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily with a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, and lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running (I have no issue with being over 12 feet from other people - I usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then I have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually I’m quietly confident going into these games but with injuries, players missing etc., I’m kind of happy if we get a draw.
I know they’re utter piss and paper-wise, we should be wiping the floor with them, but I’m just not feeling the 2/3-nil vibe at the moment!
Anyone want to talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
This is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait never mind, shit meme.
I was 6 and playing Lego Rock Band,
I decided to ask for the Buddy Holly pack.
My parents (despite being in their 40’s) said “how the shit do you know that?”
I never realised that my parents got into Weezer.
So that’s how I got into Weezer.
I genuinely don’t understand how “toxic” behavior is more punished than literally int or troll.
Well, I’ve had an account which always received those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until I got in a bad streak of losses in ranked, and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior.... And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in-game chat for toxic behavior after a report doesn’t understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait until the morning, but then I said “never mind, I just realized it’s almost 2.
I’ll just wait”.
And then he asked what would happen if I ate it right now and I said nothing.
It’s just too late.
Now he’s telling me to just say “fuck it” and just eat the cereal.
So inspiring, but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :-(
Before I realized it was 2.
Help, lol, oh wait, I can just Google it.
Never mind, lol
How to delete a subreddit.
I know your skin isn’t perfect or you’re insecure about your nose or looks.
But those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You’re beautiful, because you’re you.
Rant over.
Actually, never mind.
God, why did you give me this huge ass nose?
I’m too ugly to even rant on Snapchat, so I do it on Reddit instead.
Ok, it’s over now. Hopefully.
Can I get an RIP in the chat boys?
I was trying to go to sleep, because I couldn’t, when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked, but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says, because she only said my name in all caps and then a “never mind”.
Fuck.
I just realized I’m complaining over a 5-minute fix…
I had never heard of this “influencer” before and consider myself pretty internet savvy.
I then lost interest in her, because her Instagram wasn’t that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread, and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out, and then I took a great interest in checking in on her, because I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while:
How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her lots of money, because she claims to not be able to afford food or rent or whatever, when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers, which aren’t cheap.
I don’t like him or anything, but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my boyfriend with him.
I wouldn’t do that to him of course, but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
Me: I’m highkey liking boys more right now.
lol, this is no culture.
I’m still trying to fucking finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.
And it’s my actual birthday tomorrow, lol.
This is not meant as a rant.
It’s only just informing Oro mains that they look noobs whenever they play Oro.
Never mind, I guess this is a rant.
Never mind, it’s back up.
That’s like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying “ah, never mind, I want to eat somewhere else” as soon as they’re bringing the food out.
I played a game as Rengar and I was 6/2 and got solo killed by Anvia who didn’t have Rod of Ages or Tear finished yet.
I looked over at the replay 100 times and all I can think to my self is, if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did, the Anivia will win CNA.
Someone please explain why the fuck an Anivia is strong than a Rengar in a 1v1 when the Rengar has a gold lead?
Actually, never mind. I don’t care.
I’m just quitting this brain dead game.
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage and both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds and says “never mind”, so I just gave her mine and went on with my day.
I’m so sick of hearing the same beats of Mexican music, ahh!
Edit: I lied: the party started at 8 am and the music stopped just now at 7:30 pm.
God, if I have to go through this every weekend, I’ll just kill myself.
Edit 2: lol, 10 minutes later, never mind, the music started again.
What the fuck!
Edit 3: It started raining, so the party ended haha!
People go in the dark alone.
No one could be that stupid!
If there’s a ghost in the house, why the hell would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a little too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they’re screwed.
4. The fuck are you splitting up for?!
There’s always this one guy in horror movies that’s like: “Guys, there’s a crazy ass killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed”!
That’s exactly what the killer wants!
Basically, I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again because my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her), and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this Reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh never mind, he’s good” and “P90 is broken. I’m quitting the game”.
lol, never mind, I’m still here. I can’t sleep.
lmao, it’s just me, never mind.
Just what the title says.
Do you pick up insects and spiders with your bare hands?
I’m deathly afraid of insects and spiders, so I don’t know what to do.
I want to kill them before they get away.
Play a scuffed 24-hour WOW livestream filled with condescending undertones, belittling, and shitty half-assed ill-prepared gameplay. Throw begging, depression and sob stories on top of it and call it couples stream.
An Altarian virus, anything is possible.
In fact, that day on Onias Three, you were infected with the cell of its hosts ten days ago.
You have been in a coma, delirious.
Your fever broke this morning.
I don’t have one, because I’m 17 and haven’t gotten around to it (and no, I’m not driving, because I’m terrified) and that I haven’t gotten my gender marker changed, so no updated documents at all.
I have a passport from a while ago from before transitioning, so that doesn’t have an updated name either.
So I have no idea what to do, because I’m going to an event with them on the 14th.
If it helps, my dad’s a flight attendant (has been for like ever).
Should I cancel?
There is always next year, but, like, I’m lonely in real life, because my boyfriend is an hour away, and as much as I love my other real life buddies, I’d like a breath of fresh air :-(
I don’t know if I will.
If I do, I will be in my mid 30’s, because I want to live life my way.
But I need to have sex to have kids and that isn’t going to happen (because honestly “me too”).
I have to go camping for a scuba certification.
There is a grill and they will eat burgers.
But I am on a vegetarian diet.
(I eat some animal products but much less than I did before.
I eat 80% vegetarian)
I got pretty close with an equalizer with a little low end and high end shaved off, going into a soft clipper.
The equalizer before it makes it Slam.
I was going to try distortion and a limiter after, when I get off work.
(The limiter was highly suggested in the last post, so hopefully that’ll do the trick) I’m just looking for advice!
What should I do from here?
Someone please let me know.
You can easily get an infinite powerlock in longer fights.
I have a 4/40 Dr Octopus, and I see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and SPS, so not bad in damage either (like vision).
A very viable option for AW attack. and also arenas, as you don’t have to bait out in those small fights, because you never let them reach SP3 before you finish it.
Get ready boys.
Pogo will not open for me.
It keeps saying this device is blah blah blah… you guys know what I’m talking about.
Anyway, to fix this, I am on Android 6.0 before the security update and I have root with Magisk 16.0.
Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise, what with having a storyline that doesn’t come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and necessary amount of seriousness and comedy.
The characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert, Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events don’t always have to rely on Neptune’s presence.
Great bait, mate. I relate, straight appreciate, and congratulate.
I rate this bait an 8/8.
Please no hate,
I’m straight irate.
Create more,
Can’t wait.
We should conversate.
I won’t berate.
My number is 8888888,
I’ve taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take no more.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: Meh, ok, that’s fine.
They then use shit like A subtract 1 through A subtract 20 for variables.
In fact, I have a linear algebra book that did this... A’s for everything.
The pages were just matrices filled with A’s.
Just draw a weird shape or something - anything but that shit!
Scariest thing ever mate.
Well, well, here we are again, frustrated, angry in front of my phone.
What a neat way to start isn’t it?
All of you readers are my therapy and I don’t owe you a cent.
Perfect, right?
If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all because of your short attention span, so let’s keep it short (what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying “keep it short - I’m a genius aren’t I?”)
Well I tried explaining to my buddies that porn is kind of shabby, and yeah just bad, and you know who listened…
Hey, I just want to know what games I can run on this PC and which not.
I was a spy, and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told the jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, Mafia and Serial Killer had made their kills.
I proudly said: “I was attacked while in jail!”
Wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and asks me “You were attacked while you were in jail?” and I answer “yes mate”.
He then tells me that what I am saying is bullshit, because Serial Killer and Mafia have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously?!
Like, I don’t really care what mean, shit people on the internet say.
But when I got nobody in real life, all I have is the internet, and it does kind of hurt a bit when I just want to vent my problems.
And I’d be fine if it got maybe a single upvote and no comments, and I’d be fine.
But instead, it’s full of people saying
Oh boy, you are too dumb for the movie, boy.
The director was like “shit, it’s about the hidden meanings you have to find, boy, like you know it doesn’t spoon-feed you the film, you know?”
Like shit, why does it have to explain, mate.
Just imagine what happened, you know?
It’s not like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has, you know?
Yet when fully charged for the first 30-60 minutes, it’s always on!
Which is beautiful!
Lastly, if I do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping), the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off.
What the fuck, mate?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone, or is it just me?
In searching Google, I cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues, I am really enjoying the mod.
It’s just a fucking ball ache every single time I want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before I can puff...
Every time I log on, I want to chill away from keyword NMZ, and play Xbox and be fat, right, but lately I log on, play RS away from keyword for like 20 seconds and I get logged out, and it’s fucking annoying.
Is it my internet connection or is it the servers or what?
It’s pissing me off, mate.
Next we have my statistics class, and I didn’t realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework; and so my grade was a 70 something, and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my band class is basically easy A as it’s show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert, and so I passed that. Good game, easy, mate.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do not go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like “what the fuck, mate?” and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after, I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there.
Did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This year’s rookie game is actually going to be real exciting.
What line-ups do you want to see?
I love this show, but sadly I’m near to finishing it already.
What is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story?
I never watch movies or… so sorry about my lack of vocabulary on this though, is this called dystopian?
Well I’m really lost, but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy!
Has it happened to anyone else?
It happened to me a number of times.
So if you’re on leg 2, you have to win 10 consecutive games for the XP and coins, 10 stamina for 40 tickets.
Get the fuck out of here, EA!
Her: Oh, where’s this ice luge, haha?
Me: Probably my friend’s hotel room or wherever he can find a place for it.
Me: I came to <insert city> with my fraternity and a sorority – that’s why he’s getting it.
Her: Gotcha!
Her: What fraternity and sorority I’m in xxx.
Me: yyy. sorority is zzz.
Me: You’re interesting though.
I want to hang out with you.
When this week?
Her: Uh, maybe Friday?
Me: Ah, yes.
Me: Friday.
*one day later*
Me: <girl’s name>, we’re hanging out tomorrow, right?
I don’t like when people type huge paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me about their problems.
I don’t like when people mumble on the phone or if they ramble on, and it’s all about them.
But now it just doesn’t make sense. You only get 1 ticket per match, and if you are lucky, you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the one thing free-to-play was always able to do because of the low cost of entrance and the rewards were good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you don’t like him, use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you don’t like the new WT, then don’t play it.
Closed tech support?
It’s, 1:30am and you’re a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
What the literal fuck?
Was your heating bill too much this month so you can’t make your rent?
You mismanaged bunch of fools.
So, long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall ’22 semester, and I’m on the waitlist since April.
Housing isn’t guaranteed when you’re not a freshman, and my income isn’t enough for rent so…
There’s a possibility, I might be homeless.
My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No fucking competition.
Most men this day are thirsty as fuck.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half-assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains, they grab and grunt at everything with two legs.
And I mean that literally.
But – that’s good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24M), an accountant at a traveling company.
We ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today I called one of our agents and a girl picked up.
She was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts, and she said “yes, I will be at your company at 21:00”.
I said “ok, and at 21:00, she came by and asked who is the accountant”.
I said “I am, please follow me to the room”.
She came and I asked her how much did she bring.
She said “I have $1300 with me”, which will not cover all of their debts by the way, so I brought a receipt and wrote down the amount and the company name and then I asked her for her name.
She smiled and looked at me and said my name.
So none of my friends are answering me 😭😭
So, it’s time to make some new ones!
I’m in the mood to call, so let me know if you’re down!
Looking to talk to people around my age.
I’ve posted before so you can check out my profile for more info.
I’m a little lazy right now 🥴
Anyways, let me know what your favorite type of music is 🙃
I had been wearing Lane Bryants Lounge Bras the past four-ish years, and so this was the first time in a very long time that I wore a bra with wire.
So come Monday, I wore my new bra with wire that fit perfectly at the store, but after a few hours it felt so uncomfortable!
I am worried I wasted my money… :-(
I’m so miserable and seriously just want to cancel my trip but don’t want to disappoint my husband.
He’s been looking forward to a vacation for so long.
I’m dreading the plane ride so bad!
Luckily the flare is a bit higher and not right where I make contact when sitting, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.
I’m going to be walking around in 40 degree weather with a big angry boil on my ass.
God help me 😫
Hey, there.
I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of “you” or “your”, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
Just type out the word.
It isn’t hard.
Hi guys, I was drinking with my friends from the US and my boyfriend and everyone’s fallen asleep, and I want to play some truth or dare or drink, so if you have Discord or Kik, just message me, owo
So I just had my baby with the man of my dreams 4 months ago :-) and it felt like I was living my fairytale life.
I was in my exact vision I had, but then, long story short, postpartum with new emotions had me pull a crazy move and I checked his phone about a month ago now, only to find out he was meeting up with a  chick, doing favors for her, spending time in her room and texting a lot, all while I was pregnant.
Now he and her both say they are just friends and never hooked up (yes, I contacted her number), lol, but I don’t want to lose my man, though I also saw he has dating profiles and he says he doesn’t do it all the time.
And he won’t do it anymore.
I don’t want my baby’s parents to split, plus I love him and want our vision to carry on.
But how?
Please help.
Can I? Or should I trust him again ?
Day 17 of posting Corgi stuff (sorry for not posting for so long)
I have insomnia and I can’t sleep at night, and it’s just like I have so many ideas at night that just so many ideas keeping my up at night.
Please tell me how sometimes I can get better sleep.
Because of that, I almost failed school and because of skipped lessons, and people tell me to listen, but just, like, I talk with somebody, and then I just think of something.
I forgot what I was about to say, and I had a math tutor, but iI couldn’t focus and just also my mind is like chaos people.
Tell me.
Oh, I don’t want to take medication and I’m sensitive to medicine.
Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that.
She probably already has one also.
A real digital movie camera costs so damn much.
So I opted for an analog one.
Now, 8mm/Super 8 have an affordable price, 16mm doesn’t cost much, and 35mm costs a lot, so I think I’m going for a Super 8.
But then how does it work?
lol, I mean, I buy her a Super 8, but I should also buy her a video recorder, and some VHS… things like that.
I don’t know how it works.
Please can someone explain to me what should I do.
How do you guys do it?
It’s so scary, but I want to last forever with him, and I know I can’t tell the future, but we’ve been through so much together.
How do you guys keep it going through all the obstacles life throws at you... how?
Do you want to run some Minecraft? XD
I’m bored and my friends are busy or out right now, so...
I finished the game for the first time today.
What a wonderful and amazing game.
It hits right in the feels and fucks your mind up at times.
My ending was sad.
Kara and Alice die (I am bad at controls), North dies, Hank dies, Marcus is successful, but I let Connor kill him, because I guess I was doing kind of a role-play where Connor is the villain and the outcome is realistic.
I will try to open other openings.
But yes, the game was so good.
Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!
Maybe a little earlier, I don’t know, because I’m usually at work, but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mb/s range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more people are at home I’m going to see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60…
I am an aspiring doctor/medical student, and so seeing a lot of medicine-related subjects as early in our first semester I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!
I passed for UPLB BS Biology!
To be honest though, this wasn’t my priority program, so of course I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be a scholar, but I was also worried, because I’m not really as interested in Biology as invested I already was in Physical Therapy.
Sure, I could learn to love Biology, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year, but that’s not certain.
I will play with anyone on 2K21.
I’m an 87 over 3 level scorer. As one that will play with anyone, REP and OVR don’t matter.
I have no one to play with most of the time, and no randoms want to play with me.
Please play with me.
I promise I won’t sell.
I can shoot.
I have an 81 three, but I can shoot.
I’m a shooting guard.
I need someone who knows how to land planes on PC to help me.
That’s all.
I just need you to land the plane.
I know how to do the rest of the mission, but the plane has been messing me up for hours.
Please help as soon as possible.
My discord is SingSong254.
Contact me there, then I’ll give you my Ubisoft account information.
Thanks.
Help, I need someone who knows how to fly planes well on PC to join me.
Let’s fucking go!
What’s up guys?
I drop around 30 kills a game right now, and I’m trying to get out of low ranks and get into Platinum.
If you’re good at the game but simply don’t have a Stack, add me on Discord and we can rank up together.
Just to clarify, when I say “anything” I mean anything within the FM’s current power.
So no answers like “remove the nukes” or “boot the royals”.
We cannot do that (not yet at least…).
You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.
What do you do?
Me and my real life friends need a team that we (or especially I) can VOD review in order to learn about tarping, switching layers and positioning.
I was thinking Wolf/Soldier/Wilkinson but I’m not sure if there are any better ones.
Preferably EU as we are EU, and some stuff happening is basically exclusive to EU, lol, but I guess it could be NAE as well.
Thank you!
Looking for someone to play with right now.
No toxics and no obnoxious people.
I don’t fuck with that.
18+ NAE.
I just play for fun.
You can be bad.
I don’t care about skills 😇
One word I simply can’t say properly is water...
It actually hurts my brain trying to add the T, and I sound American if I do or still say wut-ta.
I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to say, to be honest.
I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when you meet people who drop H’s and have glottal stops.
I’m curious how likely it is that a post on my personal space will be shown to people.
Please write  “+” in the comment if you see this.
So I got a Sky Q Mini Box for upstairs.
It doesn’t work.
I have to wait until late March for an engineer.
lol
So I will be starting a job next week and desperately need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
Looking for single bedroom flats or flat-shares is a legitimate issue as three letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
Vacuum won’t stop sucking. Please send help. Is it going to blow?
Basically, if you didn’t know what that is, it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Let’s eat granny” making it seem like someone’s going to eat their nan.
However, the other example says “Lets eat, granny”, implying a different meaning to the sentence.
A pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas, I guess.
I literally couldn’t have been more at fault
I just drove straight into this woman’s Golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it).
She seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it’s my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers as well, just very minor body work and paint, maybe a small dent.
What broadband do I get?
I’ve had Virgin for 8 years, and holy shit, is it slow for £40 monthly.
Is it the old router or do I just switch to a cheaper BT or whatever?
Jeans, T-shirt, steel-cap boots, boiler suit (lol), high vis, gloves, goggles, dust mask, ear protection.
Help. I’m melting…
Edit: the heat has got to my spelling ability first. The end is nigh.
I’m sure as eggs is eggs that I’m not the only one that goes to the gas pump, and I want say £10, 9 times out of 10 it will go £10.01.
Bloody things are rigged like a slot machine, I swear, lol.
lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn’t actually laugh to.
LOL - adults and people who don’t really know how the internet works use this
Lol - I’m not sure why this came up, but it’s likely an autocorrect, but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named.
LoL - Grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
It’s also confusing because of League of Legends.
loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with “spool”, but I think it’s the drawn-out “o”.
So yeah, I think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn’t exist.
lolll - when I hear her say “loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it. but I still think that’s “loool”,
You can’t repeatedly pronounce a consonant.
So, when is Big Ben going to bong again?
Hm, mandatory title.
But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Preferably under £50!
Also, does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming (that don’t require me to stand for lengths of time).
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what I do, I literally can’t keep the dust at bay for more than 24 hours, and I am losing my mind.
It’s 10pm, 28°C, and my bum is literally melting.
Saturday session three and chat.
If this bear isn’t named Beary McBearface, we have failed as a society.
It’s 32°C here inside my flat.
I have taken the t-shirt off and soaked it in cold water.
I’m wearing it.
What genius ways are you keeping cool whilst working from home or somewhere extremely hot with no AC?
Bloody lovely fucking weather, isn’t it?
16 hours in Wetherspoons.
Okay, so I went out with my girlfriend to go to 7-11 and I had my hair in my face, a hoodie, and a mask, and someone called me he/him.
Bruh, I’m so happy right now, what the fuck (I’m non-binary and use all pronouns, but nobody has ever used he/him for me and it feels really good)
To the neighbor that went out of their way just to check on me, I appreciate that.
I just wanted to say from one Gen Z to Millennials, good on you guys.
I hope you find what you’re looking for. It’s been fun being your little buddies in life.
If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet, everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really, to be honest.
Remember, there’s a lot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that doesn’t experience a lot of positive moments, this subreddit does make me smile :-)
Damn, some people need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet, Jesus!
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kind of a lot, lol), so I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I don’t see the need, because who the fuck cares?
But now it seems that you’re all making grits without the butter and making us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were preparing to tour more plantations than Carter’s got little pills but you done gone and brought up them “slave owners” now.
It isn’t amounting to anything more than a hill of beans!
If I had my druthers, I’d have just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt something decent about history.
All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
You get along now, do you hear?
How to go from number to date?
How do I break off a relationship with my “friend”?
Basically, I put my skate account in my Instagram biography, because I have no posts on my main, and I’m kind of insecure about my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless, and people won’t expect me to be like shredded or some shit if they add me), and today I got 3 followers (girls from different towns who don’t know me).
I’m really picky though, because I don’t want to have a relationship, unless I actually feel like I’d really like the person and be into them a lot, so I didn’t follow any of them back.
Bro, I’ve been added and un-added on Instagram so many times today that it’s kind of a confidence boost, lmao.
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from people who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers, smh…
I have nothing else to say, come at me angry people, lmao.
Hi guys, I’m a casual just-for-fun gamer, playing 5-6 games a week.
Yesterday it was just pure horror division 10…
I could not win 1 game out of 6…
Like, is everyone smurfing ?
Or what’s going on?
I know people want to play the objective.
I get that, but why do you need to shush or watch full replay or every cut scene?
So basically, for my A-levels I got 82 RP and wanted to go the NUS business administration but didn’t get in, though I’m quite sure my grade is good enough, and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago… *welp* :-(
I got into SMU business administration, but I still feel damn shit that I didn’t get into NUS, so help change my mind and convince me why SMU is better than NUS, especially for business :-/
I’m most scared that in the future when I’m working, people will look down on SMU like elitism discrimination all that, I don’t know, man.
Or will they pay less or not even hire me?
RIP, because SMU is kind of 2nd best and less well known.
I would really appreciate if you all could help me out, especially those who are currently at university or have already left.
Thanks pals :-)
TLDR: the title.
Other vegans that you’re friends with tell you that they don’t tell other people that they’re vegan.
Like, they purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community, because they are probably the people that would be more gentle with their words, which is what some people need in order to listen.
I’m a very straightforward, no sugarcoating type of person, and although some people appreciate it, a lot more get upset and start trying to put words in my mouth and twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like €300 worth of fake internet points, like, what the fuck are you doing, honestly? lol
Why would you give awards to people? lol
I just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre-googling and confirmed the time that I’ll be there.
If she gives any further resistance, I think I’ll just next her, ignore her, not respond to her, agree with her that she can’t handle the place, or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first freaking date.
Yes, I agree things like Tumblr made-up identities are weird, and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted, calling people snowflakes is just weak.
Give yourself a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without any unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series! Props to you!
The New Year’s Eve Raticate with a hat.
I haven’t found him anywhere yet.
Does anyone want to raid?
I need a few people quick.
Stop.
I think what I am trying to say… this game is not hard.
Don’t make it hard yourself.
The main objective, as I understood, is to get the dragon, and don’t die before that.
Even better if you outfarm your opponent.
Just don’t die.
And trades in lane… if you see the enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights, but he was out of town.
So we couldn’t do that, and now he’s back in town, and I asked him what he’s doing on New Year’s Eve and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers from our work.
And like, he didn’t offer an invite, and then he said if he cancels with them, would I like to come over, and I just said I don’t know what I’m doing yet, so I don’t know.
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There are going to be people on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid.
Hey, the regulars!
I just wanted to say that I love the group channel, it’s amazing, and love your own channels as well.
I love all your videos, and I have a suggestion for a video for the channel:
Do a Minecraft build battle and whoever loses there, the other people get to write something on their Twitter, lol.
I hope you like my idea and can use it for a video.
I have a group chat.
It’s on Discord for people who are bored or want to chat about anything.
We already have some people who chat and stuff about anything.
It’s chill, edgy, and if you want to join, comment and I’ll direct message you the link.
I just kind of realized that I’ve never had New Year’s Eve plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that…
I recently realized that I still don’t have enough friends to have one for my 21st coming up…
I don’t know why I didn’t clue into this though.
Like, I never thought about how people have traditions for this night, besides my sister, who goes out to her friends’ every year.
It’s funny that Covid isn’t affecting my New Year at all…
Is anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway, I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight, lol.
Hello, I’m looking for people to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
Just please be aware that I’m not very good at upholding conversations. uwu F/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the Word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the “aaa” word, and I want to yank four words without selecting the spaces after “ddd”:  > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like, I see videos on YouTube on it.
But like, I can’t see any mention on the design notes, etc.
Where do people get the information from?
DM me to debate.
Please be well learned in your belief.
I want DMs, because it’ll get deep and I can’t reply to 300 people like that.
Also, I need 500 characters so here come the blah blahs.
I’m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I’m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl, but I am saying that they won’t like to do it, because they are humans with their own choices, and not agreeing to be a girl isn’t making them a women anti.
Like, how many guys around you would be willing to be turned into Disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time but how much time?
And maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
But knowing this isn’t making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they are asked to do all this.
I wouldn’t like it if you tried to make me a man and wanted me to dance in front of so many people, even though I am a tomboy.
Is anyone missing me?
If you miss a Reddit friend, read this.
It could be me!
So I just hopped on PC from PS4, not even 2.5k games played there.
I played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a keyboard and mouse, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with people 2000 kills and predators even.
Yet I haven’t even a hundred games played and about 80 kills with all characters.
I’m not really having fun anymore.
I can’t improve if I get shit on every game.
I see a lot of people on here who seem hella sad, so if you’re really sad, I’m up for a chat.
So yeah if you are up for a chat, or long-term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so.
So I always see people talk about sending designs and edits to Affinity, but how do I do that?
I’ve worked at OD for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it.
Like not even the print suppliers.
We do every type of editing in store and I hate it.
Like we’re out here doing stuff that I’m pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to Affinity based on what I see on here.
But yeah, is more of this information on the store portal or where can I learn more?
I’m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last-minute, rude customers :-)
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k, and I was like “Hell no, that’s not worth 100k”, like bruh.
Why do people find the new set expensive?
I know the girl I posted about is a troll people, but oh well, she’s got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down.
It is the bar with the team composition and the status of each character that is used to follow “report team” (like in the actual World Cup).
It can be tweaked down to not reveal too much information about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier, and you won’t have to use tab.
Hit me up with a chat message.
Tell me about yourself and we can go from there.
I don’t understand how people can build what they do...
I love building but I guess my creativity isn’t well tuned as a lot of people’s is, and it bothers me that I can’t build amazing stuff.
I know I could if had the creative side, ugh!
I just tend to give up after a while and settle for simple crap to pass for ok.
I care about how I affect people a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in conversations with big groups of people, which is related to ADHD.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kind of stand-offish to people I don’t know.
I’ll try to act like I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me but drunk people will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all are ADHD things though, because of rejection sensitive dysphoria.
I’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent.
I can have a really, really, really flirty personality at times.
I remember in high school, my friend’s mom said I had the “personality”, so I’d probably be the first to have a boyfriend.
But when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds her accountable, she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects anyone/everyone who doesn’t agree with her and screams about how she doesn’t care.
Or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck”.
She’ll never take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite.
All the things she screams at people to not do to her, she turns around and does the exact same rude, petty shit to anyone/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her.
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts just like my mom, and my mom can’t stand it/accept that
So she becomes downright nasty.
In class, I’ve usually been really quiet, but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click with in class and be really, really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen B, feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk though.
I’ve always been a smiley, happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have ADHD.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really, really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk - I heard people with ADHD are both.
Could I be ISTP?
Help type me please.
I don’t know if people would even want to.
I just want to know if that’s allowed, and if not, where would be a good place to post that.
(I’ve watched Dragonmar and other people’s videos but that would be hard to be a me-specific video on there)
Like in a good way though.
Some people are just indescribable.
I haven’t done this before, but I’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like…interests :-)
We can definitely talk about anime (especially romance - I’m a sucker for it), we can talk about games and go into detail about lore and stuff, creepy stories go hard, and really I’m just down for anything :-)
I’m not gonna be weird so long as you’re not weird.
Any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah… if I didn’t do this right let me know :-)
Oh and I’ll absolutely talk more on Snap.
The part I’m humming is like “word word word wo-o-o-ord” twice.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like “fly-y-y-yyy.”
I’m pretty sure it’s a popular song; I’ve heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah, to be honest it is.
I care about a lot of people and I can’t just... make people be happy.
But like… I want to :-(
I just want to make everybody I care about happy.
Like, is that too much to ask?
I think that some people here are AI or something.
smh, don’t even try.
I can do that by myself 🤠
Hey, F/19, bored as fuck.
I enjoy talking to new people.
Hit me up!
I started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90’s.
She said everyone was watching wrestling back then, and it was a cool thing.
Now no one gives a shit 😭 (I don’t really blame them sometimes).
I asked her “why do you think people stopped liking it”, and she said “because it’s garbage.
It’s come on Fox on Fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hits, I change the channel”.
I had to include that in there, because she’s so funny 😂😂😂
Anyways…
Hey, I can’t fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting.
Hit me up if you think we could hit it off well.
I hope we have a great time, future chat buddy ;-) 😁
It’s kind of weird, I’m not going to lie.
These motherfuckers can outrun, outswim or outstam (through venom) anything that tries to get them.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
I just finished the show so I’m a little behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much, lol.
Also by sidestory I mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
My favorite Obama quote: “Michael and I also want to… uh… acknowledge… uh… uh… uh… your son Jack, who deployed today.”
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc.
I’m having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best games ever that I have played!
But I have some problems…
I’d always heard of Mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple of months ago, and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists right now.
Anyway, those were just my thoughts.
Happy New Year’s everyone!
I hope the new year treats you well.
Now for this one, it’s kind of hard, because the enemies are so cool for this game, but...
If I had to choose, I’d say I like the clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not the only enemy in the game that doesn’t have a single other variation from what I remember.
Honestly, I wasn’t going to make one, but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I disagree with a lot of others’ lists.
Not to say that my list is right, because this is all subjective anyway, which is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
Yay!
In my opinion, Lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind I’ve only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of episode 3).
Unlike her father, Lily tries to work with Lee and for the most part the group.
She does what she has to.
She is a bit of a bitch, because she has to.
I only have 1 problem with Lily.
She killed Carly.
If you could get Ben to confess… Yes, I got spoiled on that and a few other things.
Ben is useless.
He is what looks like a college student, yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7.
Please don’t downvote me into oblivion if I missed something.
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats.
So 4 isn’t really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kind of sucks in my opinion.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who has lived both as a woman and as a man.
(Not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
So that’s kind of neat in my opinion.
I don’t think he did the role justice.
I feel before Neo figured it out, the way he was speaking was ok, but after… in my opinion, he should have gone full Hugo Weaving speech.
I just wanted to share my opinion not being a United fan, on the game against Burnley.
(Not that many of you will care).
McTominay - sheesh, what a guy.
I thought that Shaw was solid.
Now you’ve got two good left backs in good form.
Also I wanted to say AWB had a much better game, I thought.
After the shitty games and Dalot playing well I personally thought AWB improved a lot.
Haha. Oh my god, it’s terribly funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can only drop at 4-6, Yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues, but for me I can live with those issues but not this.
Please change!
It’s kind of an odd question in my opinion, but I have a ball python who I just got to eat frozen/thawed for the first time (yay!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I’ve tried frozen/thawed large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
It could be a fluke though.
I know it’s like a meme or something of “Dark Souls player complains about the combat” or something similar, but I just don’t get the combat.
I can do DS3 Deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately.
I know it’s not a difficult game, but hear me out real quick if you know the game.
Oh my God!
Why do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they don’t have any idea of how a torrent even works (it’s so damn easy though!).
Comments like “The link doesn’t work”, rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
You’re just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤 Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So I get tipped on the app, they gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the application after?
What the fuck is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before, but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was less than the app tip...
If you are tipping both, tip both.
Not going to lie, Teamfight Tactics is a good mode, but it’s like Hearthstone a good game to play on your phone, not something to grind out all day all night, like what the fuck?
It’s not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on, prep up and alt tab until it’s next time you can do anything).
Any thoughts?
I know it’s a scientific things and all, but some of the posts there are just too much.
Learning dream languages?
What the fuck?
And some bloke is saying “I tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didn’t lucid dream?!” every few hours.
Maybe the posts are just getting a little too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like “Dear lord, what the fuck is happening, ooh”.
So I am a first time cup user, and I got the Saalt cup at Target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today, and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold + 17 year-old virgin = ow).
I got it in with the 7-fold, and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how the fuck am I supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails?
In one way, it kind of helped me find the cup lowkey grip, but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping.
I’m down to my last dollars soon, and I can’t just eat beer and cigarettes.
Then I set them down so I didn’t have to carry them across the street to get beer (it’s cheaper at Adventure’s First Stop).
Then I walked back and forgot my groceries.
I walked all the way home and, ah shit, I’m getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill.
I live on a hill.
Down.
In the middle, really.
I imagine it’s like an amateur San Francisco.
So I walked back and got them.
No crime round these parts.
Not much, anyway.
I didn’t think about nails...
Is he going to tell her?
If so how would that conversation go down?!
Okay, what the fuck!
Arlo now knows Sera (I don’t know how to spell her full name) is John’s weakness.
First of all, we’ve seen they are greedy as fuck (OK, not as much other mobile studios, but still).
Second, the game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high-end phones).
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
What the fuck are you Yanks on?
See also: (on an article about how it’s “40 degrees in some parts of Europe”) > what the fuck, lol, that’s not hot at all.
Put on a jacket, dummies!
(“[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16°C”) > Oh my God, that’s really cold.
I’m never moving to canada.
Sometimes it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me the fuck out and gives me nods similar to codeine.
Why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with whether or not a woman looks at me and thinks I’m ugly.
If that happens, I get anxious from it.
But if a women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks I’m decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
What the fuck is going on?
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisible, even if they don’t detect you, they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I should’ve just grabbed a submachine gun and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many tries, most of them being on his second phase.
His 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7th place on the last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead of 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Because I have less than 3000 points.
(I need 55 Magaki frags and I get 50 - just feel my suffering)
Also in another event with gamer764 I have around 8000 points and got 4th place and got rewards for 4th place, not for 1st.
What is it with needing 7k points or more?
Are the developers too greedy?
I hope the title makes sense.
I have a list of names “john.baker” (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 columns “john” and “baker”.
Thanks!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were going to see each other, and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday, and so I canceled it, and now she won’t stop saying sorry that’s not what she meant.
What the fuck do I do?
I told her I was going on another one next month (lie) to make her feel better, but I didn’t.
But I don’t necessarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks!
Okay, so I’ve got less than a chapter left in Gardens of the Moon and I still can’t understand what the fuck Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I’m missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots.
You all are whack.
What the fuck!
I posted a literal anime foot and still didn’t even make most controversial post of the day, let alone of all time.
So huh, you can’t alpha Karthus ult? What the fuck is this bullshit?
It would be very helpful if all of you original posters out there actually said what the fuck it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it! Such as “now I understand why this [brand name] thing has everyone going crazy”…
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn’t mean much to me.
If it’s too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever at the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the “DFW teams are cursed” camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me too much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential what the fuck transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a PC, but in the meantime I’m using a crappy 13-year-old PC.
I got money for Rust, bought it and it took 4 hours to download, 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server.
After I hit a tree with my rock, my game crashed.
At this time it was 12:47 am and I just said fuck it and went to bed ready for a whole lot of shit today.
EM opens the door: May I help you?
Me:
Yes!
Why did you give your kid permission to enter my house without my permission?
EM:
GT just wanted Smores and to find treasure.
GT pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.
My girlfriend’s face just turned red, because the treasure he found was her dildo.
My girlfriend snatches that out of GT’s hand.
GF:
This isn’t meant for kids.
GT:
But it’s mine - I found it and finders keepers.
EM: Give him back his treasure.
Me:
Why the fuck are you not watching your son, EM, because he has embarrassed my girlfriend and entered my home without permission.
I have to break up the format “xxx.yyy” into two separate columns “xxx” and “yyy”.
Stop!
Me:
Yes, ma’am.
EM:
What are you listening to?
Me: Better Off Dead from Josh A.
EM: What?!
EK: mom, stop!
Me: Bett-
EM:
I heard you.
What is that cover?
*points to album cover*
Me:
Oh, I think that’s a reference to cu-
EM: *cuts me off again* to satanic ritual.
Me: No, not at all.
EK: Mom, please stop!
EM:
No, EK, this is a bad man.
EM (to me): Now give me your phone.
It was at this moment I knew this was a entitled parent.
Me:
No.
EM:
But my EK needs it.
He’s got his degree.
EK: Mom, I’m 10.
Me:
*coughs* Damn!
EM:
How dare you swear in front of my son?
Yes, she said that damn was a cuss.
Me:
Damn is not a cuss word.
She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot and cold.
Now she’s on to another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state.
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago, we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind of disrespectful to the new boyfriend, huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd.
However, I will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her, but I can’t think of a reason why I should…
After going “uh no?”, she sends me a picture of said candle holder from her kitchen.
I of course go “what the fuck, you’re home?”, and it turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So I’m beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
TLDR: sickly narcisstic mom went into hospital for 3 days.
I find out she’s home because of a candle holder.
It’s been a few years and I don’t care to look back so long as we can be happy together, but it’s really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is that I let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message I sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful because of a song I made that I was sharing.
I was very flirtatious, maybe more so than I was with my girlfriend when I was first talking to her, and that has been echoing in my girlfriend’s mind.
It’s been extremely difficult for her.
We have two dogs now.
I was hoping us having two puppies to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again, because we have them to bond over, but she still can’t say “I love you too”.
She doesn’t accept when I try to give her compliments, because I’ve said rude things in the past when I used to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games, but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you, but I don’t see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trimming my nails, wearing Versace Crystal Noir and other fragrances etc., which I believe is the reason why most girls, even if they’re taken, at least are willing to have a conversation with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self-development, and even though I’ve been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, I never let it get me down and I’m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women, even though I may not have Hollywood good looks or charisma like Will Smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and I wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :-)
She’s 18 inches long and weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
I’m just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champion every 4-5 days and she’s already longer than some males get, so I’m curious!
The anime is about a main character that’s in a game, but she doesn’t realise it, but the system says she’s dead and etc.
I would like to watch the rest of it, so please help me.
Looking for an anime.
I don’t know if to others it’s strange, but to me it was.
I got Covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so I had to tell my mum.
I could’ve just lied and said it was because of sharing cups or kissing a girl, since I’m bi-sexual, but I knew my parents would be accepting...
So I told them as it was.
My mum was very disappointed, because she thought she knew me well, and though I told her everything, but now she couldn’t trust me anymore, because blah blah blah…
Basically, he was very disappointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that I didn’t feel like telling her, because it’s private to me... until today.
She doesn’t really trust me like before, but she’s ok, lol.
Today it’s my birthday, so I’m sharing my “strange” coming out story.
I am confused. What’s going on, lol?
This is my first time with SFU e-mail.
After the semester I haven’t touched anything school-related until today heh, so I don’t know how to fix this.
So me and my friend started playing Valorant again and want us to learn communications such as heaven and all of that.
Now I know what heaven is, but I don’t know others, and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If you’re still confused, I’ll give a scenario: “I hit the Jett, she’s in heaven”, like the location.
She’s an awesome cook, does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but she’s not a good cook either, lol.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well.
She can’t be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or it’s a guy)
She’s all nice and sweet to everyone else, but she’s just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong (not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it., which is wrong.
When she is there, she doesn’t do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren’t there.
The worst part about it is that people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The “false advertising” on the A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill, where it says multiple buffs can’t co-exist.
Maybe I’m the only one, but I think this is all dumb and also kills a lot of people’s excitement.
I don’t like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star, lol.
It’s just like Zhongli.
He was fine, but everyone freaked, because he wasn’t doing enough to dumpster content and was balanced.
I’ve seen lots of people in the fandom make rude or racist comments about Liberty and it’s disgusting.
Please leave her alone.
And you do realize she’s black?
Stop making fun of the actors’ ethnic features.
It’s honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general.
It’s not even funny.
Honestly, it’s just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And it’s not even just Liberty.
I’ve seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmy’s hair.
(Also moderators, please don’t take this down.
I really want people to see it, and I have done nothing wrong.
I’ve been having some of my posts randomly deleted for no reason)
(As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guacamole.)
She then told me we gave her less meat, when I brought back the same plate without guacamole.
She’s home for the first time!
She’s finally back!
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my puppy in her crate at night, because if I don’t she will poop on the floor.
So there’s already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then I have work, which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my Corgi in my bathroom at this time, because if I don’t, she will reek havoc unsupervised.
Am I the asshole for starting a fight with an old friend (strong swearing)?
Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbelievable loss to let a broken and thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest apologies for bumping straight into a noble that half-marched in his drunken stupor down the sidewalk, straight out of a liquor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the main street makes in a month, I was invited to finish the wasted goods, lest they spoil any further.
“Yes sir!
May the heavens cry before your merciful heart!”
“Now get lost!
This is no place for disease-ridden vermin like you.”
“Of course my lord!”
I ran back down the alley I squirmed my way out of.
Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went.
Further and further out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on Snapchat with my friend.
Me and my friend were arguing as a “joke” and then she said she preferred older guys, and my friend was (M14), and I said I’m a year older than you, and she says “what I mean by older guys, I mean aged 17” and it hurt my heart.
TLDR: My crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and I’m 16 and she’s 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here, but I don’t know if I am the butthole or entitled one this story.
This is short, but I was expecting to get a tattoo for my 18th birthday like any 18-year-old, but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to.
I sent a direct message to the artist I wanted, but nothing for 2 months.
Like yeah, I understand they are booked for summer tattoos, but at least say “Hey I am booked for the rest of ____”.
But I was like “ok, well I am going to look at another artist’s work from this shop that does small tattoos.”
Same thing happens: no answer.
So me and my brother decide “ok, let’s go to the shop and ask, then we will at least get a answer”.
We go, and this young girl attends to us.
Let’s call her Brenda.
I told her everything.
Brenda said “well you can do the tattoo with me”.
I said “I’ll be back.
I’ll think about it”.
I got back in the car and scrolled through her work.
It was good work, so I went back and told her “yeah let’s do this”.
I signed everything.
She didn’t even ask for ID, which I found weird, because I had gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on.
I brushed it off, since she’s new and all.
She worked on me for an hour, told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her.
I was like “ok, great, thanks!”
4 weeks passed and there were a lot of mistakes made, because I got a small tattoo heartbeat with a “;” in the middle, but the period on top was a small heart.
The right side of the heart was smaller then the other side, and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again.
So I reset it, and yeah oops, I was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn’t dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry, and like through text she kind of sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if she’s mad, and like she said she’s only a bit let down.
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me, and like I apologized to her and she said its alright.
Then I just told her I’m going to sleep, and she just left my message on delivered and, like, she didn’t reply until today.
How to tell whether she’s mad at me or just annoyed, because right now I’m really confused?
Would I be the asshole if I was just a bigger sarcastic asshole to another asshole?
Her tumors are beginning to open through her skin, she won’t jump, painkillers don’t help, she ate a lot yesterday but won’t eat or drink today, she hid most the day, but... it’s hard, because she’s alert.
It feels wrong, because she looks at me like “I love you.
I’m happy you’re here with me.”
But the vet said she wasn’t even supposed to live this long, and the tumors will only get worse, and even if we had done chemotherapy, it would have only prolonged it.
My friend told my girlfriend something.
She then broke up with me.
I don’t know what to do now, because she and the ex-friend were the only people that I had.
What should I do to try and regain my relationship, because she’s helped me through a lot over our 2 years of dating?
TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me because of something someone said, and I want to regain my relationship with my girlfriend.
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee, because she’s a person of color with tattoos and “fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up, because I need to protect my staff, but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex loves kids.
She was playing Captain Save a Hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman’s situation with this girl’s “crazy” baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in each other’s life.
It hasn’t even been two months!
I’m so hurt.
She never wanted to build a life with me.
I knew she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, as soon as he saw that I was weeping, answered, “Come with me.”
Onward he moved, I close his steps pursued.
Entering, he led me with him on the bounds of a great circle itself encircling a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land covered with lava pyramids, with sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life save for those imprisoned in it, who, though they surrounded us, dared not approach for fear of the master.
As my ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, cries, and explosions that made the eternal air tremble, caused by slaughter, starvation, withering, and frief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, of men, women, and children.
They’ve grown out to the point they look kind of awkward, and she’s saying I should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something I’d like better?
Aah!
She said she might have some clothes that fit me.
I’m dying!
She’s so supportive and nice, oh my God!
So, it’s 0:34 the first of January while posting this, and my sister (F14) just ruined my New Year by calling my mum fat and telling her she’s a drinker when she poured herself a glass of champagne, which she only does on her birthday on Christmas Eve and on New year.
Now my parents are pissed off, my grandparents are pissed off, and my sister thinks she was funny.
The same thing happened on Christmas Eve, and now the whole feeling of New Year is gone and I hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sorry for my spelling.
Screw INTJ’s. Why have they got to be good at everything?
It was a mistake getting the booster the day before New Year’s.
I feel like absolute dog water.
Literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and I almost cried 🙏 I’m so happy, bro.
She’s so cool.
I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :-)
Also, happy New Year’s Eve and happy New Year everyone!
First of all, the satisfaction I get from saying I am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
A high I’ll never come off of.
Second of all, a customer comes in for the second time, mad because I didn’t do copies from a book because of copyright.
She goes “well, I called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
And I’m like ??, ma’am it’s in our policy.
I don’t care what customer service says.
She keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy”.
Like, lol, not when you act rude like that.
Our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and she’s such a cuddly, loving, little girl and I love her cuddles every night and in the morning.
I’m just scared that she isn’t going to be like that after she gets fixed.
Am I overthinking it?
Do you think since she’s in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she’ll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I don’t fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently she’s been asking me if I’ll fart in front of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and it’s weird she’s never heard me do it.
I can’t believe she saying I’m depressed looking while she’s such a shy girl and weird thinking she’s not.
So delusional.
I hate it, but they are my only friends.
She’s calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to D2 after several year, now I’m wondering: Where do you guys sell or buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or is there a website that’s more efficient?
My friends are mean and delusional.
One is immature and shy and always pulling me down.
The other is fine, just jealous, and it’s getting on my nerves.
What to do?
This is a setup I can live with.
My boyfriend’s and my fear however is that in a few years when we’re ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own boyfriend.
I’m very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow any more pushing of the boundaries.
What do I do here?
Boundary Issues with my boyfriend’s alter.
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was up-front when we met and said she’s shit at texting, and has apologised when we were speaking for slow replies, something to which I said “don’t worry, I know you’re busy!”
The conversation seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation.
However, I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread), but she’s viewed my story and posted a story since.
It was New Year’s Eve.
So I was all ready for the New Year actually thinking positive and the changes I’m going to make, etc.
Then I see he’s posted a picture of them both that she’s taken saying “love of my life”.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face!
Ex’s boyfriend posted a picture of them :-(
Every time I ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even though she’s older, what the fuck?) and that I shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her.
She drains the life out of me.
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently I’ve been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, I could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brought herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to separate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later, we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great.
I’m so happy.
In our anniversary month, what do I see on his phone Snapchat?
I look at it again, I see Jane, but this time I can look at their conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So I just got my first bearded dragon.
He’s only a month old, and like most new owners, I’m worried about if he or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day, but so far I’ve only been able to feed him about 6-7 crickets.
I’ve tried feeding him some vegetables too, but the guy doesn’t show any interest in them.
Is there anything I’m doing wrong or is he just fine and I’m overly worried?
Then I found out about this really cool website called Complex.
They’re sort of like journalism but better, since they’re all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through Complex.
Before, I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic, but Travis Scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
Now I like Tame Impala, and I’ve started dressing weirder, I bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully I’ll wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromises himself/herself on social media?
Is it just me cringing at the Twitter posts by Albatross?
Everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
He’s making it seem like XVG is a sinking ship at the moment, and it’s doing fine.
So I have this friend in real life.
Man, the dude is known everywhere.
He’s got a solid reputation on the streets, in the jails.
Everywhere this guy goes, everyone knows him.
He was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on Reddit, because I feel like I’m not really known.
How do you get hella karma?
I’m 21, he’s about to be 23.
My issue is that he seems to have no ambition anymore.
He doesn’t work and doesn’t make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an EMT.
He failed it the first time by 2 points, and I think he fears failure so he doesn’t really want to try anything anymore.
He’s been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
I’ve gotten Super Smough about 5 times, but I always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear I’m far enough away, but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
I’m using a 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helms and naked (even with tattered armor it doesn’t seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know by throwing myself at them enough times I’ll get them, but it’s slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do, but I seem to always get caught in a dumb combination or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or notice the letter I put in there, and now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you you read this sentence wrong too?
Well, now that I have your attention!
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :-)
19/F Aw shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time.
If I just want to make Draven my 1 carry, how should I do it?
I know he’s a good unit, but what items can turn him into a god?
I tried healing sword and rapid fire cannon, but I get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character.
However, his shield’s gun is overpowered and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets that’s fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate, because it got absorbed.
I don’t know about other players’ opinions, but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so he’s not overpowered enough to counter everything.
Tell me what you people think.
I didn’t think anything of it, so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him, the entitled kid started screaming “Mommy, he stole my cookies!”
At first I was startled.
I started to get nervous, and I froze.
Then entitled parent walks up and starts yelling “Give those cookies back to my daughter!
Give them back!”
And I did not know what to say at first, but then something came to mind: just say “but I didn’t.”
But the way I said it was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That’s when my dad noticed (he’s old — sad he didn’t realise a little bit earlier) He called a manager to the scene, and the manager told us to continue and he’ll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We’re both xxx majors (I’m a dual xxx and yyy major while she’s a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn’t say I’m smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I’m a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (she will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
It’s not until my next billing cycle that I noticed something was off.
I was a bit lower than normal and I keep a very close eye on my expenses.
I looked over my bank statements and there it was: My new Prime bill.
I was super confused and got hold of Amazon’s customer support.
They helped me as much as they could, but because I was receiving my service through the phone company, I would have to go though them and figure out the problem.
The next day that I had off, I walked in and talked to a very sweet girl, who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kind of talked in circles for a bit as I tried to explain what the Amazon customer service told me.
We looked me up in their system and there I was: 2 lines, but no Prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date I opened my first line and then the second.
Both dates added up to what I had told her before.
She stared at the computer screen for a while with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tomorrow I’m no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach out all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered, it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance, and he messaged me on Friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said I didn’t change anything.
After that part of the conversation ended, I asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
He said that he’s good when he doesn’t think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him, etc.
Day 1 of no contact starts tomorrow.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster.
We used my name and I’ll credit his Instagram below.
He’s a good guy.
I’m glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and our story.
Would you guys like either homemade lore or not?
I couldn’t post this on the Fallout Reddit for some reason.
It wouldn’t let me put the photo.
I hope it’s good, guys!
Is it even possible for ITSOKTOCRY to blow up outside of the 3 songs he’s had do extremely well? Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for a while, and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much I despise griefers, because they don’t just destroy something in a game, they destroy hours of work, and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying I’m mean if I don’t go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non-stop how I’m “mean” or a “bad person”, because I’m busy doing something so I can’t go give him his shit.
Well, I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I don’t see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy.
We do get slightly tipsy, you know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a Facebook message saying he’s ready for her to leave (she’d been there 2 hours at this point) and then he starts passive-aggressive cleaning in front of us.
He’s going through a divorce so he keeps telling me that’s taking all his money.
I didn’t give him a title as I didn’t even get one when I bought it.
It was salvaged from some guys at a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale, but I’ve long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do you think it’s not worth it?
Also, if I did want to how, would I?
So I just told this guy in my class, who was also weird as fuck and gave it to him saying “oof, I sat on it.
It broke.
Do you just want it?”
He’s like “no, ew”.
I have OCD and immediately got ashamed and was like “lol, why’s it gross?
It’s the same as a whole one (and along that line), like, lol, why?”, and he was like “ok, oof, it’s not” and I’m like “lol, why did you say that?”
I was saying it jokingly, but I’m afraid I looked weird.
Like what the fuck?
Why’s she upset or playfully upset that I don’t want it.
My human staff comes home tasting of sausages and cheese.
I think she has another fluff she is making treats for.
Should I be sad or angry?
What does your human taste of when they come home?
I can tell where your human has been and what they do by taste when they come back?
Anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday I finally mustered up the courage to message him.
Me: Hey, how’s everything?
Him: It’s been a long time.
Me: Sorry about last year.
I was super awkward around you, lol.
Him: lol, no, don’t worry about it.
*drum roll please*
Me: To be honest, I liked you blah blah blah…
Him: Haha, you could’ve just told me!
Next time you see me just say hi.
Do you still go to <school>?
I’m not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn’t sit well with me.
Hey guys, I just wanted to share this helpful application with you all :-D.
It’s not that I am trying to promote this application or something.
It really helped me a lot.
That’s why I thought it might even help you guys out.
I’ve seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team OVRs, and many are thinking to buy players, but can’t decide which will boost their team OVRs the most.
This application helps to calculate the OVR of your team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people (F2P players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team OVR since it will result in a huge loss of coins (because of 10% EA tax).
What’s the recommended amount of dedicated RAM I should have to server?
If you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself.
You should be asleep.
Go to bed, I say.
Once upon a time, there was a girl named Star Butterfly.
She had blond hair, blue eyes and a super cute and colorful dress.
And she had a magic wand!
One day she got kicked out of Mewny (her home dimension) by her mean mom >:-( just because she made a mistake.
So she had to go to Earth.
On Earth, there was a boy named Marco Diaz.
He liked safety and he was super handsome.
Everybody at school was in love with him!
(Except for that idiot Jackie)
So anyway, Star came to the principal’s office.
He was like “Star, this is Marco.
He’s your guide.”
Star looked at Marco and she was shocked.
“Wow, you’re so hot.”
“lol, thank you” he said, blushing, and he winked.
“Let me show you around the school.”
“Ok”, said Star.
So they walked around school and they became friends.
“Ok, since you’re my best friend now, I should probably tell you who I am”, said Star.
“I’m a magic princess”.
Then she took out her wand and created 667 laser puppies!
I have a question for this Reddit.
Can you provide honest answers?
I currently have a custom build PC with i7 3770k 32g@1666 RAM and single GTX 1080 GPU.
Should I get a second one for 650 euros or wait for what upcoming years will bring?
GTX 1080 SLI or save money for 11th generation Nvidia xx80 TI GPU?
I know a lot about Jailbreak.
Should I make a Jailbreak?
How many likes can a thoughtless post get as long as I like Telecaster? :l.
If you don’t upvote post you hate Telecasters and should die.
Thanks, ok.
I love Telecasters.
We should rename August to October, because he wasn’t released in August.
I’m out, boys :-)
I bought GTA4 for Steam PC and it won’t work.
It worked fine for a small year on Windows 7, and now my PC has Windows 10 and it won’t work.
I made Social Club and Games for Windows Live accounts, but it won’t work even with accounts.
It won’t work even for single player.
It won’t work after the people on screen wait in the loading screen.
Then suddenly when the game should start, it just closes the window and that’s it.
So how make it work ?
How do we get them to know they should use it?
The only feasible situation I see is a complete and big economic collapse...
I want to use it, because I want to control my own destiny and not be robbed by the central banks or the government and I want to feel my own liberty.
I do not have even $1 in my bank account, because I don’t want to own debt tokens.
I want to own freedom...
How do we change the landscape?
What are your thoughts?
Sorry for my English being bad.
I should buy up that limited time bike for Halloween before it disappears next week.
Inside your body, deep beneath your skin, muscles, and not beneath your organs, lurks 1 (one) skeleton.
Spooky!
But wait, it gets worse.
The skeleton inside you doesn’t even pay rent!
He/she lives in your body so he/she should pay rent!
They freeload off you and don’t even do shit for you.
So you should evict your spooky boy.
Happy Halloween!
Edit: I didn’t expect this post to blow up like it has!
Thanks for the 6 upvotes!
Just small information, I’m 5’9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k, but I really can’t hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical “you should be good, but you’re not, so I’m going to give you unrealistic goals”, or should I be at 1:49?
My head hurts when I go krumping heads with other boys!
Green lighting things go all over the place too!
What should I do, doctors?!
Right, so I’ve fixed my headaches!
I’ve had to throw up some burny green stuff!
The boss says I should do that more on the battle, the place we’ve been fighting in!
I’ve got a metal stick for my trouble too!
This poem went as follows: > My name is frog, > I like to play, > Out in the rain, > All night and day.
> My skin is green, > My face is coy, > You look and say, > Here comes that boy.
This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Aren’t you all tired of seeing at least the first two jumping into battle and wiping out your whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying that if they weren’t here then, well, the game would be balanced.
Well, I beg to differ, because there’s Akai with his insane disruption and Diggie with his timely ult or maybe even Irithel might be banned because of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly, the king and queen of this game are Lancelot and his beloved Fanny.
You know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O decides to go to the gym to do a quick workout, whatever that is.
She says to me, “You leave the steak alone, doggo.
You be a good girl!”
She tied a plastic bag real tight around the steak.
Haha!
Then she goes into the gym, and when she come back many forevers later, guess what?
Haha!
She opens the tiny car and looks at me and looks at the steak bag… and she says, “Good Girl!
You left the steak alone!”
And that is the story of me being a good girl.
Mom-O says she should have brought the steak into the gym and left it on the bench next to her with her sweatshirt.
She says she is dumb not to think of that.
Maybe Mom-O will get smart in a few forevers.
Now I obviously can’t get out and shut it on the main road, so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I’ve quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothing’s happened.
My bed smells like disease.
I should probably wash it.
Please send me some tips and stuff on what to teach him.
Currently he’s doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns, because that’s the only gun he gets kills from.
I already taught him the basics like planting the spike and things like that.
By the way, this is coming from an Iron 3 player (hardstuck, friends say I should be silver and some even say platinum, because I carried a gold player).
Do you know how some motherfuckers exist?
They literally get close to you, then all of a sudden you have problems, and even though you apologize again and again and again, no it’s never enough for them.
I was in a Google Meet, but I told them I’d be back in 10.
I forgot my phone so I went to get it, and guess what, them speaking about you and backstabbing you.
You seriously don’t know what to do and whom to trust anymore.
Maybe I am overthinking, but I’d rather die alone than live among these kind of people.
Maybe I should just ignore them?
Or should I give them another chance?
Or maybe I am just weird, lol.
l have developed feelings for my best friend.
Now, the question is: should l tell her how l feel about her?
Will this affect our relationship that we have?
How will she take it?
I’ve been waiting for two years now, savings from then and I barely made 200 USD until now.
I’m still studying, and gaming is my dream… and these prices are giving me depression and hopelessness from life… to be honest…
What should I get?
A monitor or a GPU…?
Some of you are so lucky to get a GPU for free on here… lol…
Am I the asshole?
Me (31F) asked my kids dad (43M) to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in the kids’ room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not meant to lift too much or stretch but felt OK and thought I could do it alone.
I can’t.
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of the walls where I can’t reach.
He said yes and today came to do it.
After a bit, he said he was done and leaving.
I gave him £20 and said how grateful I am for the help.
I checked the room once he left...
Both kids’ beds were full of torn off wallpaper, drawers cracked where he stood on them.
I’ve still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent the last 45 minutes picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds.
Am I the asshole if I confront him about the mess or should I let it go and not bother asking in future?
My boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when I ask dumb questions (for example, I didn’t know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard?
Just fill it”.
So I tried to do it but I failed.
Later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?”
Then when I do it myself and don’t ask him he goes “why don’t you ask me?
I can teach you or help you”, but I refrain from asking, because he gets frustrated.
The last couple of calls had arguments, as he got mad, because I beat his ass in video games (even though gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked about him to lots of my real life friends, and they all ask why I continue to be his friend, and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only people who actively tries to interact with him online.
Yeah I know, my shoes don’t match.
They match the graffiti though!
I’m trying a lot of different styles, so let me know what I should change.
Hat: Sicko by Ian Conner
Shoes: Nike Everything else is thrifted.
Ok, so I swallowed a small piece of box (?) tape as I was trying to bite it off with my teeth, and then I feel it in my ear 😭 not ear but that hole in my throat that leads to the ear.
It’s just stuck there, oh my God 😭😭😭 What should I do, lol?
I don’t remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida, there’s a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100 times longer than when it’s not making a sound.
I’d describe it as that trademark desert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff, and … it’s just dude what…?
Heck, it’s weird.
So maybe it’s both a sort of a paradox (life is), but I just want to know, honestly, did anyone else feel it?
I want a logical explanation please, and if one doesn’t exist, well I mean, because long before…
I was “of age” so to speak… for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate, because I don’t drink, but I’ve…hmm…
I’m an adult, let’s put it like that.
There’s other stuff out there, but long before that, me and my family saw a UFO.
Even my stepdad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been, and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall and, like… it doesn’t really scare me, because I think it’s the way life is.
Things change.
They don’t always have to make sense, and others say that too.
Here is an example of two paragraphs written in the alternate spelling system and then in regular spelling: > The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.
Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt.
Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak.
And so the North Wind was obliged to confer that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
> That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm autumn moon.
Look out, I shout, for he’s foiled you yet again, creating chaos.
Who would win?
Please give a detailed explanation.
Ares (Greek mythology) vs. Mars (Roman mythology) vs. Svetovid (Slavic mythology) vs. Odin (Norse mythology) vs. The Big Bang (Atheistic mythology).
I am very ready.
I am very good.
I would like to apply for village idiot.
Should I get Horizon Zero Dawn or ELEX, because they are the same price right now, so what should I buy?
I’m just looking for reason.
By the way, I like open world a lot and shooters, e.g. Skyrim, Battlefield, COD, Ark Survival Evolved.
So any ideas on what I should be?
By the way, I would prefer them really quick.
Thanks in advance.
Thanks for the suggestions guys.
We are going to try to get the AK-477, because someone said it would help, but where do we find it?!
Please help with it.
We can’t do it alone :-)
I reside in Hyderabad, India, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in computer science.
I am a Canadian citizen, but for enrolment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam.
Now, the doubt that has arisen is… would my admission be considered international or domestic?
On a side note, how hard is it to be admitted to UoT’s computer science program?
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
I would prefer a hardcore clan with a plan.
With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal or target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It’s not a necessity, but it would be nice.
PM me if you’re interested!
By the way, it’s my first post on this subreddit, so I might not have gotten it all down correct.
Locusts, grasshoppers, etc. can shut the hell up.
I’ve literally heard people tell me they learnt then forgot the entire Japanese language through anime.
I live in a house with a single mother whose first language is Thai and I barely heard English until I was like 4.
She would speak in Thai to me yet I don’t know any Thai.
You can’t learn Japanese though anime.
In fact I watched anime in Thai dubbed as a child.
I don’t fucking know shit.
Fools thinking they are out here saying “konnichiwa” in style, I’m contacting the authorities.
Here’s a question for you.
So you know the Panzer, Blue Gitz, the Tau or whatever?
So I, being a Mek, notice that they’ve got tanks and stuff that are flying, right, but they’ve not go the flames coming from whatever thrusters keep them in the air.
And they don’t make the beautiful roar that thrusters make.
I figure some commando would want a flying truck that doesn’t make a noise.
It’s a good market strategy.
Anyway, the question: “how do I krump gravity without a sound?”
Construction: teleport to house, for when they work on making player-owned houses useful, this would be godly to have.
Heck!
Even now, player-owned houses has a permanent dummy for adrenaline building, prayer altar, and if they make it like Old School RuneScape, where you can teleport outside any player-owned house portal, this cape would be used a lot.
Hitpoints: Heal from regeneration ability increased, current perk I doubt would be used at either bossing or slayer.
This one is used at slayer at least.
I got one of my annual minds.com token ads in my mail today (I of course unsubscribed as soon as I found the option) and thought “hey, what the heck, let’s make a visit on the supposedly “alternative Facebook” that I just recently got denied for having a “non-believable name” and waiting further ID specification before I can use it again.”
And so I did and found out on the 2nd or 3rd post that The AJ Show has been blocked on YouTube, I’m not a fan of rightwing stuff and was actually the reason I stopped watching it 2 years ago, though the small fragrance of freedom was that hard to find among the 90% national-capitalism the site has to offer, but anyhow, I got the idea of a non-censoring video site like LiveLeak but much more simple and less “newsy” that anyone can post on.
No content would be removed ❤️
Hi guys.
I’m at 1500 hours right now, and my instructor still doesn’t let me solo.
I think I’m doing my manoeuvres ok, but the instructor says I still need more practice.
I’ve tried my manoeuvres on a flight simulator, and my friend captain says that I should stop sending him videos of me playing GTA on my computer at 1 in the morning, although I trained hard on my flight manoeuvres.
What should I do?
I’m literally crying and shaking right now.
My friend would never do that :-(
Why don’t they make like Sesame Street for the kids, yo?
Like, it is very educational, I think kids would learn a lot from it.
I’m kind of hoping to find a place that doesn’t charge those exorbitant commission and all the extras.
I have some questions and hope someone can help answer.
1. I saw some ads on Shooroq... no commission, etc.
Are there any hidden costs I need to be vary about?
2. Is there enough parking for the second car?
3. How much would the DEWA charges for a 1BHK come to?
4. Any other areas I should look for in Dubai that has reasonable rent ?
It’s a bit unnerving to manage expenses on 1 person’s salary in this place...
I appreciate any advice I get.
Bones says something like “switchblade on my waist don’t test”, and it was old young teenage bones, and the beat was hella mellow.
I would really appreciate this.
Finally it’s giving me an internet connection, but the only problem is, it’s so slow.
It’s capable of loading like Google, but anything else just times out.
And for some reason I can’t access my router admin page.
Really weird.
It’s just a white screen or it times out loading it, or the page becomes unresponsive!
Help would be appreciated, thank you!
Hey all, so today I was in the group chat with friends, and like four of them were roasting the fuck out of me, and at first it was funny, then my ego and self-respect got crippled after building it up for a couple days.
Haha, fun.
Yes, I know I am lonely and won’t get a girlfriend, but you don’t need to be jerk like that, haha.
I’ve searched far and wide across the internet with nothing to show for it.
They could even go woah eee ahh ahh/oh eee ahh.
The possibilities are endless and I know it’s hard.
I’m just wondering if anyone knows it, thanks!
Hi there, it’s good to see you again!
*sits down*
How have you been?
*cuts a potato with my sacrificial dagger*
Wow, that’s great to hear.
*adds 12kg of salt*
Hm, there we go.
*throws a handful over my left shoulder for the devil*
Ok good, let’s eat.
*removes a small flask from my jacket and pours blood from it onto my plate in a small thick puddle*
Haha, that’s the good stuff right there.
*chomp chomp
*
Do you want some?
No?
Ok good *eats a spoonful of salt*
Oh!
This is crunchy.
*chews and spits out bones*
Huh *licks lips*
Welp, that was wonderful, I’m pooped.
*gets up*
Thanks for having me over!
*transforms into a bat and flies away*
I’m feeling sad, but it’s okay I guess.
Because medicines will help help us all.
Thank you, have a good morning and good night and good evening Truman show, haha.
Just kidding.
It’s going to be just as shitty if not worse than last year.
All these skin mods and such, how’s it being done?
I’d like to try it.
Is it player-side only?
Mods?
How are people modding Battlefront 2 or is it Photoshop?
Hi, I was wondering whether or not it is worth dropping some money on pets.
Like, I saw how much some people can spend on them to get good results (like T4), and I wouldn’t want to spend that much :-D.
Currently, I have 5 T1 pets, and I wouldn’t mind seeing some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping “just” $100 would be worth it.
Is it worth dropping $100 on pets?
Towards the end of senior year and that summer, I don’t know what happened, but I got a hot body and my face was all “girl, you’ve been through some shit.
Have a gift”, so now I’m pretty.
I just made a post on a different subreddit about having a nice date today, which is nice, but I am very hesitant on making friends and stuff because of the last two years.
So like, after my glow up or whatever, more people started talking to me, yeah.
And a lot of boys did too!
I never really had very many friends, so this was a huge yay!
The first boy I hung out with was really nice, but then we got high and I did very regrettable things I do not like.
Well, that boy was super happy and told lots of boys.
I don’t want to jinx it and call them out by name, but I’m talking with a company and I’m hoping it works out!
I’m excited about all things I’ll be able to do with these free promo products to help other people and possibly get them off some or all of their Rx drugs!
I’m excited for myself, because I have a bunch of medical issues that I do not use Rx drugs for and the other stuff I buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others, and it will help this company as well.
I’m ready, I’m ready!
I’m hella excited! I might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do: my plant’s now way too small for its age in my opinion and has started to grow pistils.
Should I chop and restart or…?
I will be posting more here once I get… comfortable again.
(Self-love is important!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through - will get to them when I can :-)
In the meantime, Happy New Year!
P.S. I don’t have a Snapchat and don’t take any money, I just like to show off, you know, closet slut things :-)
lol
Talk to you later, everyone!
He said “shh, just kiss me you fool”.
I still love him and I cried so much on Valentine’s weekend (don’t judge, lmao), but I said “No.
You’re fucked up now.
What’s going on?”
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says “good lord, what the fuck happened?
I’ve got to garden.
Talk to you later”.
He read my reply, which said “I’m so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it, and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated”.
I just don’t know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him, and he will always be my first, and I’ll always talk to him and care for him, but I don’t want to be held in limbo.
I’m trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know whenever I say “talk to you later” or “good night” or whatever I want to add an “I love you”.
Just casually.
To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day, just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten-fold.
I know sometimes I daydream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
It makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
To be honest, I kind of hope it is, because I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof, is it hitting me hard!
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I (I will takes days or a week to respond), but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to at the moment.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick “talk to you later” either to be honest.
Finally they seem to want to engage with me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then on the day.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on, and it’s not like we’re really talking, so I just block them.
I don’t know, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival.
I’m still “Ocean Serene”, but maybe I’m...
I don’t know, that’s a tough thing to say, I never thought that my girlfriend was just a random.
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said a lot of things, I’m gonna agree that if I change, the world changes.
The advice you get, it’s always iffy.
I want to speak for everyone, but at the same time I can only speak for myself.
Also, I went to get some rum and coke.
I got coke and a few other people saw it, so they bought some coke…
erm, I hope my friends are ok (that’s all you weirdos I’m talking about).
Random story I know.
To be honest, I’m not ok, but I’m surviving like usual.
Actually I’m all just a bit right and fine.
Talk to you later.
Talk to you later.
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, it’s 8 hours to [redacted], 7 to [redacted].
Not a big deal.
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles, an hour’s drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol [me] I suppose [redacted] or [redacted]’s wife ratted me out.
Maybe I should block them too.
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house, and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you, and we can see how well that went.
[me] Shit.
Betrayal.
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self-gratification.
I was in a toxic relationship for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our relationship, we were great.
One day, both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
I’m going to admit that sometimes when I feel jealous, I just want her to reassure me like how I reassure her that it’s all good, but she will only reassure me once and then said “bye” or “talk to you later”.
Most of the time in an argument, it’s always my fault.
She won’t admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight won’t continue anymore.
And I said “But yeah yeah, you’re right.”
And he said “Yeah, well I’ve got to go.
I’m doing something”, and I was going to type “alright, talk to you later”, but I realized we aren’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe.
When the conversation started.
But once he said he’s doing something, my heart dropped.
Like, what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him, but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doens’t like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now, I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he wants to do that.
If he doesn’t want to talk to me, he can just fucking tell me.
I don’t know what else to put besides that I hate the current circumstance of life I live in.
I’m going to give a little insight tomorrow.
Ok, I lied.
I have to reveal my age tomorrow, because if I don’t, it’ll mess up the story.
Um, I don’t know what to type so I’ll type a worry I have.
Um, I don’t think I’ll get the tape gun in time.
Ok bye, talk to you later everyone.
She said something like “but I want to make sure that we go as a friend?” thing and I was like “okay, I know”, and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said “of course I like my long time boyfriend”.
Yeah, whatever, right, haha.
And here’s my question...
Yesterday when I was at work, she messaged me saying something like “how’s your work doing?”, and I kind of replied to her with a cold tone saying “I’m at work, talk to you later”, and
then she, kind of upset: “Okay, I mean I understand you are at work so busy, but you didn’t cut me off like this before; so I kind of get it that you don’t want to talk anymore like before.
Got it!
Bye!”
How do you get destiny delicacies?
I’ve seen a few people have them, but I’ve never got one.
I don’t know where you get them.
If anyone knows, it would be a lot of help :-)
And my machine fucking freezes up.
It’s been happening for like 2 days now...
This machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3D scanner, but 4 browser tabs on Reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% of my damn memory and 60% of my CPU power and freezes the whole damn thing up.
Hey!
Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint!
Seriously, what the fuck are you developers doing?
Stop, please!
If you think it’s rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying “got to go, I’ll talk to you later”, then it’s also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one-off.
Things happen.
Maybe something came up and you got distracted, etc.
But every single person ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It’s really not that hard to just say “got to go, I’ll text you later” or “so-and-so just got home, talk to you later”.
Even just “bye” or “be right back” or something!
Today I got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if I did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn’t want to ignore them just to talk to me.
I said it wouldn’t be a problem if he had just said something like “I can’t talk right now” or “I’m with my friends, talk to you later” or just literally anything.
He then said I was overthinking stuff and I should “chill out”, so I left it at that.
So am I the asshole and overthinking things
?
Am I the asshole for getting mad at my boyfriend after he ignored me for a few days?
So I would usually post this on r/keto, but that subreddit is so intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But, like, a girl’s got to rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
I have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere, I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, calories please”.
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their “no cheat days” mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten-free dairy-free carbohydrate dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
As far I as I know, the concept of mini-album is only around in K-pop (maybe I-pop?).
I’m always disappointed when a long-awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5-song album.
I can tolerate a debut album, since you really don’t have a lot of material, but if you’re SNSD or something and you come out with mini after a years long hiatus like Mr.Mr, it’s kind of insulting.
I don’t know what to say, lol.
I’m pretty funny, not only because I manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often, but also because I’m just fucking hilarious to be honest.
I’m from Yorkshire, and that probably makes me cooler than you, because the North is just superior, and I’m ready to die on this hill, but I guess we can be mates.
I would really like some of those.
Ok, I’m running out of people to laugh at my jokes.
17M from the UK, Please be able to hold a conversation, lol.
I don’t know what kind of dog this was, but it was so ugly.
My god, who would own such a thing?
Dogs with wrinkles like Pugs, Shar Peis (I don’t know how to spell it), Bulldogs, Boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all; I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally been told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness and over the nose, they can’t breathe)
And yes, I know I’m going to get shit on by all the fucking neckbeards on Reddit that just adore their snot nose little Pug.
I don’t even care.
I’m so tired of people and their dogs.
Every time I listen to him, shit makes so much sense, even though I don’t know what he is talking about.
That leads me to believe that either that guy is a genius who can articulate what’s going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something.
I mean what should I listen to if I really want to find out the truth, if Schiff is just “biased toward gold”, and that’s the reason why he is so hard on the current economy, etc.
Are boobs nice?
Because, I don’t know, I’ve never seen them before.
Then he checks the oil level, saying that the oil also smells like gasoline, that gasoline and oil are mixing up together.
He opens one spark plug, sees the massive leak in there literally full up.
Let me say, oil smells like gasoline.
I didn’t smell that one.
That’s what the worker told me.
Then he call his boss, and the boss says it is not gasoline, it is just oil, “that shit smells like gasoline” 🤦🏾‍♂️ Even the worker confirmed that I’m not crazy, but ay, maybe I am.
And his worker told me he was going to seal the black thing that goes on top of the spark plug that covers it.
Sorry, my English is not that amazing.
He said he was putting a seal after draining the oil as he mentioned.
As oil drained, the oil sealed the thing so oil doesn’t drip out of it and doesn’t drip to the floor.
But it didn’t help me find the cause of why oil is getting into the spark plug, because a seal on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️ He tells me if the problem keeps on, it is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way too much oil and is causing the oil leak, that if the problems persist I will have to remove it.
Sorry for the long paragraph, but I need advice.
I need help to be honest.
My rabbit didn’t eat or drink, so I went to check him.
It’s been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food, I don’t know.
(He has constipation so I’m going to check if he poops.)
How do I sleep if I have to check on my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is going to become chaotic, lol.
I assume the time has already passed for this, but, I don’t know, I figured I may as well ask.
I kind of forgot I even had those tickets until they announced they’d be touring again today.
Now, my aunts (grandma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated grandma both before and after she passed.
When my grandma first started getting sick, my sister wasn’t the best, because she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but grandma was also scared of Covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job I couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back and forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
Would I be the asshole if I didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So I met this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dating.
Last night, everything was all right, she was happy said “good night” and “I love you” like every night.
And the next morning when I texted her good morning, she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad as fuck all day because of me but didn’t want to say why.
I don’t know what I did.
I did nothing.
What should I do?
How can I contact her?
Should I give her space?
My girlfriend blocked me, and I don’t know why.
Mine’s ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in which I have an F.
This is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I’ve done but are nowhere in the books,
This kind of snuck up on me, because I thought they were done and filed, only to check my grades and find out they weren’t.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you are going to say “I know right, I only have an 89, why couldn’t she round up?
Fuck my life)
I’m going to be honest, that’s not very helpful right now.
So first off, Bard top.
What a pick, I know right?
Let’s drop down my main build, because it’s the best assassin play style I like.
*my core is static/ie/RFC.
Now, I tried many ways, and this is the best way.
I like to safely clear and lay out poke.
Now under certain occasions like against a Garen, I’d go what many would call Shotgun Bard, swapping out static for Runaan’s and if needed rapid firecannon for Phantom Dancer.
Giving some more tank…
Now, as for the other two, I actually leave them more optional picks in the ability power department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain.
I’d pick up Hextech Gunblade.
This item is phenomenal on Bard, and hits are great.
If you’re already carrying hard, I’d go something like Liandry’s, because with the lead, no one will catch you with this, and the chunk is just Bard crazy.
I’m tet to try Gunblade and Liandry’s together, but someday…
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years, we’re both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It’s driving me crazy, how to deal with it?
This wouldn’t be an issue if all your servers asked at the beginning “do you guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.”
Also, why restaurants have to be set up like that?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Why can’t you just get up to the cashier and pay for your fucking share of the food?
Hey guys, Bard main.
I just joined Reddit after finding out there are other off-meta Bards!
So I main him top.
Yes, it’s scary, but I do.
So I’ve been getting a lot of questions about my builds from friends and happy on-lookers lately!
I thought I’d share my builds!
I’m 16 years old, 5’9.
I’m new to basketball and I’d like to ask for drills I can do by myself so I can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I don’t have a decent shot nor a decent handle, I could barely reach the backboard plus I have no friends so don’t even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why I wanted to be good at it so bad is because I just want people to know me as somebody, because right now I’m a nobody, I want to be somebody.
P.S. I’ve never played an actual basketball ever in my life…
I know, right?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising, you know) but pretty chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when I want to be), goofy, a little chaotic, big overthinker kind of deal.
Enneagram type 4, because apparently that matters (just kidding!).
I’m honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love... you get the gist :-)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist, so a program with medical school prerequisites would be preferable.
Plus, I plan to take my medical school abroad (wow, big dreams much?
I doubt I’d get in, but it wouldn’t hurt to try though).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me.
I’d be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh, and location too.
I’m short, so if my classes are far, I might as well rollerskate my way through campus, just kidding.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, you know...
Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would’ve prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do.
The player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn’t played TLOU 1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now, but I don’t know if I want to pursue her.
It’s complicated.
Right now its summer break, so I’m going to wait until school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person, because they don’t talk to me online, lol.
I don’t know how long this series will go, but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I don’t know how long this is going to take but probably quite a while.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I don’t have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say that if you’re a kid, like an elementary school kid and you’re here, where the fuck are your parents? lol, never mind, fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Because I got them and no one to give them too, lmao, just kidding, unless...
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium Sprite and a McDouble?
So I don’t know why I got on everyone’s nerves about the separate checks…
Hey, hi!
Haha...
I’m new here, I didn’t know this existed until now.
I am extremely shy and don’t know what I’m doing here typing this, haha.
But hey, first time for everything right?
If we don’t click and you lose interest, then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry, lmao.
I don’t expect to get any messages, but hey, it’s worth a try.
P.S.
I don’t know how to write these properly, so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format, oh my.
Oh and if I don’t reply soon, it might mean I’m asleep or playing DnD, hehe.
Never mind.
My internet is down right now.
Fuck.
Well I’m going to see if I can buy some stuff off Steam now... Let’s hope there are still some good sales.
Okay, so I was a total noob and erased my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was going to use, but I sent Monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
Or how do you open the .key file?
Edit: never mind, I’m a complete noob.
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive Monero wallet seeds with a .keyfile?
user765123: No, I just had the “is now playing” thing show up.
A:
I know.
A:
Well, here we go.
A: “easily disturbed”, lol
A:
Momma, help me.
A:
Help me.
A:
What’s the canon name?
user765123: ?
A: my name.
A:
What’s the canon one?
user765123:
There is none, pick whatever name you want.
A:
Oh.
A:
Am I a girl?
user765123: Male.
A:
Argh.
<talking about their name here> user765123
:
That seems like a good name.
user765123:
lol A: >:-)
user765123:
(not that it really matters.
I just used my real life name)
Comment So I can guess your gender based on your post history.
Never mind… let me guess your gender instead.
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the professor is October 18.
(Edit: never mind, this part isn’t true, please disregard).
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is February 9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the professor that I’m dropping the course?
Do I also have to get permission?
I’m planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits by the way.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I really wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what?!” really loudly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “never mind”, because I felt like I was in the motherfucking spotlight.
But every time, my narcissistic mom says that it can’t be true, because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
“It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?”
Um, I don’t know, maybe it’s because we’re different people with different bodies?
To be honest, has anyone ever experienced fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn’t die and manage to kill a least one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch, but rampage didn’t pop his ult yet.
😲 What the fuck?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky as fuck fighter, and a carry that solos everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches, it drops down to between .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2 or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on, it stays down also.
I’m not positive, but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, there’s always the possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord, but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses, never mind the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in...
Oh, and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down, and I won’t leave my dog home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
Like now I feel guilty for smiling.
Never mind the fake ones shit, but fuck.
Haha.
Ugh.
Why am I still alive?
lol, why the fuck does smiling hurt?
Then I see a figure slowly walking towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
The moment I look up, Paul is looking straight at me, still walking towards me.
I don’t say anything or look back down, because, get this: he says the first he’s ever said to me in the sexiest, most hottest, attractive way possible.
He says “What’s up?” in this low, quieter voice but has the cutest but at the same time hottest smile ever.
I blow up inside and I smile back, not holding back my overjoyed emotions.
And I say “hi”, with the biggest smile I probably had.
I’m just praying to God now that I didn’t have nasty stuff in my teeth or that my face didn’t look disgusting.
But I look straight nail down at my food and pokerfacedely keep eating my food.
I do that for maybe 3 seconds.
Then I look back up.
Paul has just stated walking away, which means he was standing there looking at me or doing God knows what for 3 seconds.
Edit: Yes, I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen.
Useful, I know.
But ugh.
They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
By the way, there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit

:
never mind.
I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance.
Oops, now I’m not getting any MP!
Try to type in chat, “I will not cheat on this game!”
The message repeats every time I hit enter.
What the fuck!
I’m not cheating.
Anyway, I type those words into the chat (“I will not cheat on this game!”) and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Worst way to tell a player to turn off Adblock, but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player.
10/10 I’m never playing again.
Edit: never mind, anytime I type in the chat, the same shit happens.
I’m going to skip the Oscar-bait shit like The Post, because there’s only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Democrats making movies about how (extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) “politics used to be more polite.
We need a return to the discourse.”
I’m sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much better that he’s worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas, but I’m just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns at the moment, but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior offensive line I think is a major problem, but there is no Nelson-like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA, and the Iowa guy (I cannot spell his name) is good, but that’s still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there, that’s really the only situation where I absolutely stay put.
2 months ago, I bought a cheap ’95 Nissan truck.
I was only locally driving, so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn’t put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm.
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd only when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can’t rev it past 3k in my driveway without feeling like I’m going to break something, I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it.
It’ll hit close to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule out what could be causing this power-sap, i.e. is it the air or fuel or a clogged cat or exhaust, etc. or something entirely different?
I ruled out “different”, I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone else’s narcissistic mom treat you like you’re overreacting about your period pains?
Hey!
I read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangerous.
Is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2-month Boston Terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refused to poop anywhere except inside.
My friends think she said that because she was with her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up, etc.
Others think it’s a way for her to be evil, like think of me, because I’m never coming to get that charm.
I think it’s some type of hoover, good or bad.
Any insight is appreciated.
If you’re a woman, please tell me your perspective.
So confused, but she is clearly with someone else, and why couldn’t she call me back and why didn’t she respond to my text messages?
She could’ve said “I’m with my boyfriend, please don’t call me”, but she didn’t.
Just a side note: my boyfriend and I are buying a house.
We will be moving out in 2 months.
Once the papers are all finalized.
I have an Australian Shepherd, 9 months.
My boyfriend (24M) and I (25F) got her at 3 months.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with, a black Labrador and a small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a Rat Terrier.
Their play style is boxing.
And one of my room mates (25M) has a Beagle.
He doesn’t like to play much.
In fact, he seems kind of scared too.
I know all of these things about my dog.
I know that it doesn’t matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise, doesn’t matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business.
What matters is that my dog is nervous.
So when I hold my hand out and tell you, “no, he’s not sitting or lying down because he’s calmly waiting for you to say hi, it’s because he’s nervous and insecure”, I don’t mean it as a joke, and it’s not an invitation for you to say, “aw, well my dog/child is very friendly, so let me approach!”
I don’t care if your dog/child is friendly or “dog savvy”.
I don’t care if your dog “is just a puppy”.
(why the hell is that even relevant?
Is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies?).
I don’t care if your child is capable of not screeching “oh my God, a puppy”.
Can you, you know, do something about your child? And also your dog?
But with less than 3 months to go for that, I feel I’m not ready yet, but having never taken it, I have nothing to compare it to besides colleagues’ advice.
Without knowing what I know, they can’t know if I’m actually ready yet, but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this bad and it would be awesome to be done 6 months from my introductory exam.
I’m close...
I just don’t know if I’m 2 months study close.
Some certified advice.
(M/5’10”/26/165-195lbs) 2 months progress, am I gaining too much weight?
I passed my FAA PPL written!
I know this sounds weird, but here’s my issue.
About 4 months ago, I had an 3700X which died after start, crashing when I tried to play games, and a day later not booting.
I sent to RMA, they confirmed the CPU was dead and gave my money back after 2 months.
After that I got an 3800X.
As soon as I tried, I got the boot code 7b, everything powered up but no reboots or video signal.
I sent to RMA this time with the store.
After 1 month they confirmed the CPU was faulty and sent me a new one.
I got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom (T) has always been the type where her feelings matter first and only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone else’s fault entirely.
For example: I needed someone to babysit our then 2-month-old for 3-4 hours.
Dad’s work had someone who had Covid.
We opted out of them watching our son and asked my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her before I set it all up, because I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its my fault and she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her days after the incident, because she didn’t call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing, T promptly got off the phone.
I never got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to T’s narcissism.
I don’t expect an apology from T, because she never has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
Would I be the asshole for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5 months, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2 months, he’s co
-
slept with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I’ve been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get a 2-month baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (currently replacing pacifier every hour).
First time mother to a sweet 2-month-old girl, and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
First time mother struggling with sleeps.
So I already have an orange golden chinchilla (Toto, 2 months old) and we have had Toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got Terri (2-month Himalayan Ragdoll) to keep each other company.
It’s only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor.
Just always going “brr rrr rrr”.
I’m not sure if she has a blocked nose, because Toto never made this kind of sound...
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
I can’t play until tomorrow but would like to know, so I can make money hunting or robbing everything and everyone.
How much do pelts sell for online?
Alright everyone, I think I mis-tagged this earlier, so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily with a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, and lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running (I have no issue with being over 12 feet from other people - I usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then I have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually I’m quietly confident going into these games but with injuries, players missing etc., I’m kind of happy if we get a draw.
I know they’re utter piss and paper-wise, we should be wiping the floor with them, but I’m just not feeling the 2/3-nil vibe at the moment!
Anyone want to talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
This is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait never mind, shit meme.
I was 6 and playing Lego Rock Band, I decided to ask for the Buddy Holly pack.
My parents (despite being in their 40’s) said “how the shit do you know that?”
I never realised that my parents got into Weezer.
So that’s how I got into Weezer.
I genuinely don’t understand how “toxic” behavior is more punished than literally int or troll.
Well, I’ve had an account which always received those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until I got in a bad streak of losses in ranked, and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior....
And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in-game chat for toxic behavior after a report doesn’t understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait until the morning, but then I said “never mind, I just realized it’s almost 2.
I’ll just wait”.
And then he asked what would happen if I ate it right now and I said nothing.
It’s just too late.
Now he’s telling me to just say “fuck it” and just eat the cereal.
So inspiring, but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :-(
Before I realized it was 2.
Help, lol, oh wait, I can just Google it.
Never mind, lol
How to delete a subreddit.
I know your skin isn’t perfect or you’re insecure about your nose or looks.
But those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You’re beautiful, because you’re you.
Rant over.
Actually, never mind.
God, why did you give me this huge ass nose?
I’m too ugly to even rant on Snapchat, so I do it on Reddit instead.
Ok, it’s over now.
Hopefully.
Can I get an RIP in the chat boys?
I was trying to go to sleep, because I couldn’t, when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked, but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says, because she only said my name in all caps and then a “never mind”.
Fuck.
I just realized I’m complaining over a 5-minute fix…
I had never heard of this “influencer” before and consider myself pretty internet savvy.
I then lost interest in her, because her Instagram wasn’t that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread, and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out, and then I took a great interest in checking in on her, because I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while: How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her lots of money, because she claims to not be able to afford food or rent or whatever, when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers, which aren’t cheap.
I don’t like him or anything, but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my boyfriend with him.
I wouldn’t do that to him of course, but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?
Me: I’m highkey liking boys more right now.
lol, this is no culture.
I’m still trying to fucking finish this project while studying for a final on Wednesday.
And it’s my actual birthday tomorrow, lol.
This is not meant as a rant.
It’s only just informing Oro mains that they look noobs whenever they play Oro.
Never mind, I guess this is a rant.
Never mind, it’s back up.
That’s like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying “ah, never mind, I want to eat somewhere else” as soon as they’re bringing the food out.
I played a game as Rengar and I was 6/2 and got solo killed by Anvia who didn’t have Rod of Ages or Tear finished yet.
I looked over at the replay 100 times and all I can think to my self is, if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did, the Anivia will win CNA.
Someone please explain why the fuck an Anivia is strong than a Rengar in a 1v1 when the Rengar has a gold lead?
Actually, never mind.
I don’t care.
I’m just quitting this brain dead game.
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage and both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds and says “never mind”, so I just gave her mine and went on with my day.
I’m so sick of hearing the same beats of Mexican music, ahh!
Edit:
I lied: the party started at 8 am and the music stopped just now at 7:30 pm.
God, if I have to go through this every weekend, I’ll just kill myself.
Edit 2:
lol, 10 minutes later, never mind, the music started again.
What the fuck!
Edit 3:
It started raining, so the party ended haha!
People go in the dark alone.
No one could be that stupid!
If there’s a ghost in the house, why the hell would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a little too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they’re screwed.
4. The fuck are you splitting up for?!
There’s always this one guy in horror movies that’s like: “Guys, there’s a crazy ass killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed”!
That’s exactly what the killer wants!
Basically, I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again because my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her), and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this Reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh never mind, he’s good” and “P90 is broken.
I’m quitting the game”.
lol, never mind, I’m still here.
I can’t sleep.
lmao, it’s just me, never mind.
Just what the title says.
Do you pick up insects and spiders with your bare hands?
I’m deathly afraid of insects and spiders, so I don’t know what to do.
I want to kill them before they get away.
Play a scuffed 24-hour WOW livestream filled with condescending undertones, belittling, and shitty half-assed ill-prepared gameplay.
Throw begging, depression and sob stories on top of it and call it couples stream.
An Altarian virus, anything is possible.
In fact, that day on Onias Three, you were infected with the cell of its hosts ten days ago.
You have been in a coma, delirious.
Your fever broke this morning.
I don’t have one, because I’m 17 and haven’t gotten around to it (and no, I’m not driving, because I’m terrified) and that I haven’t gotten my gender marker changed, so no updated documents at all.
I have a passport from a while ago from before transitioning, so that doesn’t have an updated name either.
So I have no idea what to do, because I’m going to an event with them on the 14th.
If it helps, my dad’s a flight attendant (has been for like ever).
Should I cancel?
There is always next year, but, like, I’m lonely in real life, because my boyfriend is an hour away, and as much as I love my other real life buddies, I’d like a breath of fresh air :-(
I don’t know if I will.
If I do, I will be in my mid 30’s, because I want to live life my way.
But I need to have sex to have kids and that isn’t going to happen (because honestly “me too”).
I have to go camping for a scuba certification.
There is a grill and they will eat burgers.
But I am on a vegetarian diet.
(I eat some animal products but much less than I did before.
I eat 80% vegetarian)
I got pretty close with an equalizer with a little low end and high end shaved off, going into a soft clipper.
The equalizer before it makes it Slam.
I was going to try distortion and a limiter after, when I get off work.
(The limiter was highly suggested in the last post, so hopefully that’ll do the trick)
I’m just looking for advice!
What should I do from here? Someone please let me know.
You can easily get an infinite powerlock in longer fights.
I have a 4/40 Dr Octopus, and I see some pretty good numbers on critical hits and SPS, so not bad in damage either (like vision).
A very viable option for AW attack.
and also arenas, as you don’t have to bait out in those small fights, because you never let them reach SP3 before you finish it.
Get ready boys.
Pogo will not open for me.
It keeps saying this device is blah blah blah… you guys know what I’m talking about.
Anyway, to fix this, I am on Android 6.0 before the security update and I have root with Magisk 16.0.
Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise, what with having a storyline that doesn’t come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and necessary amount of seriousness and comedy.
The characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert, Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events don’t always have to rely on Neptune’s presence.
Great bait, mate.
I relate, straight appreciate, and congratulate.
I rate this bait an 8/8.
Please no hate, I’m straight irate.
Create more, Can’t wait.
We should conversate.
I won’t berate.
My number is 8888888,
I’ve taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take no more.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: Meh, ok, that’s fine.
They then use shit like A subtract 1 through A subtract 20 for variables.
In fact, I have a linear algebra book that did this... A’s for everything.
The pages were just matrices filled with A’s.
Just draw a weird shape or something - anything but that shit!
Scariest thing ever mate.
Well, well, here we are again, frustrated, angry in front of my phone.
What a neat way to start isn’t it?
All of you readers are my therapy and I don’t owe you a cent.
Perfect, right?
If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all because of your short attention span, so let’s keep it short (what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying “keep it short - I’m a genius aren’t I?”)
Well I tried explaining to my buddies that porn is kind of shabby, and yeah just bad, and you know who listened…
Hey, I just want to know what games I can run on this PC and which not.
I was a spy, and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told the jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, Mafia and Serial Killer had made their kills.
I proudly said: “I was attacked while in jail!”
Wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and asks me “You were attacked while you were in jail?” and I answer “yes mate”.
He then tells me that what I am saying is bullshit, because Serial Killer and Mafia have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously?!
Like, I don’t really care what mean, shit people on the internet say.
But when I got nobody in real life, all I have is the internet, and it does kind of hurt a bit when I just want to vent my problems.
And I’d be fine if it got maybe a single upvote and no comments, and I’d be fine.
But instead, it’s full of people saying
Oh boy, you are too dumb for the movie, boy.
The director was like “shit, it’s about the hidden meanings you have to find, boy, like you know it doesn’t spoon-feed you the film, you know?”
Like shit, why does it have to explain, mate.
Just imagine what happened, you know?
It’s not like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has, you know?
Yet when fully charged for the first 30-60 minutes, it’s always on!
Which is beautiful!
Lastly, if I do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping), the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off.
What the fuck, mate?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone, or is it just me?
In searching Google, I cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues, I am really enjoying the mod.
It’s just a fucking ball ache every single time I want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before I can puff...
Every time I log on, I want to chill away from keyword NMZ, and play Xbox and be fat, right, but lately I log on, play RS away from keyword for like 20 seconds and I get logged out, and it’s fucking annoying.
Is it my internet connection or is it the servers or what?
It’s pissing me off, mate.
Next we have my statistics class, and I didn’t realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework; and so my grade was a 70 something, and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my band class is basically easy A as it’s show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert, and so I passed that.
Good game, easy, mate.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do not go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like “what the fuck, mate?” and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after, I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there.
Did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This year’s rookie game is actually going to be real exciting. What line-ups do you want to see?
I love this show, but sadly I’m near to finishing it already.
What is this called and are there other movies or shows based on this really special kind of story?
I never watch movies or… so sorry about my lack of vocabulary on this though, is this called dystopian?
Well I’m really lost, but I just want some other stuff like this to watch, it’s crazy!
Has it happened to anyone else?
It happened to me a number of times.
So if you’re on leg 2, you have to win 10 consecutive games for the XP and coins, 10 stamina for 40 tickets.
Get the fuck out of here, EA!
Her: Oh, where’s this ice luge, haha?
Me: Probably my friend’s hotel room or wherever he can find a place for it.
Me:
I came to <insert city> with my fraternity and a sorority – that’s why he’s getting it.
Her: Gotcha!
Her: What fraternity and sorority I’m in xxx.
Me: yyy.
sorority is zzz.
Me: You’re interesting though.
I want to hang out with you.
When this week?
Her: Uh, maybe Friday?
Me: Ah, yes.
Me: Friday.
*one day later*
Me: <girl’s name>, we’re hanging out tomorrow, right?
I don’t like when people type huge paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me about their problems.
I don’t like when people mumble on the phone or if they ramble on, and it’s all about them.
But now it just doesn’t make sense.
You only get 1 ticket per match, and if you are lucky, you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the one thing free-to-play was always able to do because of the low cost of entrance and the rewards were good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you don’t like him, use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you don’t like the new WT, then don’t play it.
Closed tech support?
It’s, 1:30am and you’re a billion-dollar, global enterprise.
What the literal fuck?
Was your heating bill too much this month so you can’t make your rent?
You mismanaged bunch of fools.
So, long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall ’22 semester, and I’m on the waitlist since April.
Housing isn’t guaranteed when you’re not a freshman, and my income isn’t enough for rent so… There’s a possibility, I might be homeless.
My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No fucking competition.
Most men this day are thirsty as fuck.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half-assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains, they grab and grunt at everything with two legs.
And I mean that literally.
But – that’s good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24M), an accountant at a traveling company.
We ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today I called one of our agents and a girl picked up.
She was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts, and she said “yes, I will be at your company at 21:00”.
I said “ok, and at 21:00, she came by and asked who is the accountant”.
I said “I am, please follow me to the room”.
She came and I asked her how much did she bring.
She said “I have $1300 with me”, which will not cover all of their debts by the way, so I brought a receipt and wrote down the amount and the company name and then I asked her for her name.
She smiled and looked at me and said my name.
So none of my friends are answering me 😭😭 So, it’s time to make some new ones!
I’m in the mood to call, so let me know if you’re down!
Looking to talk to people around my age.
I’ve posted before so you can check out my profile for more info.
I’m a little lazy right now 🥴
Anyways, let me know what your favorite type of music is 🙃
I had been wearing Lane Bryants Lounge Bras the past four-ish years, and so this was the first time in a very long time that I wore a bra with wire.
So come Monday, I wore my new bra with wire that fit perfectly at the store, but after a few hours it felt so uncomfortable!
I am worried I wasted my money… :-(
I’m so miserable and seriously just want to cancel my trip but don’t want to disappoint my husband.
He’s been looking forward to a vacation for so long.
I’m dreading the plane ride so bad!
Luckily the flare is a bit higher and not right where I make contact when sitting, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.
I’m going to be walking around in 40 degree weather with a big angry boil on my ass.
God help me 😫
Hey, there.
I’m talking about “ppl” instead of people “u” or “ur” instead of “you” or “your”, “tho” instead of “though” and so on.
It’s getting old, and you look like an idiot when you spell like this.
Just type out the word.
It isn’t hard.
Hi guys, I was drinking with my friends from the US and my boyfriend and everyone’s fallen asleep, and I want to play some truth or dare or drink, so if you have Discord or Kik, just message me, owo
So I just had my baby with the man of my dreams 4 months ago :-) and it felt like I was living my fairytale life.
I was in my exact vision I had, but then, long story short, postpartum with new emotions had me pull a crazy move and I checked his phone about a month ago now, only to find out he was meeting up with a chick, doing favors for her, spending time in her room and texting a lot, all while I was pregnant.
Now he and her both say they are just friends and never hooked up (yes, I contacted her number), lol, but I don’t want to lose my man, though I also saw he has dating profiles and he says he doesn’t do it all the time.
And he won’t do it anymore.
I don’t want my baby’s parents to split, plus I love him and want our vision to carry on.
But how?
Please help.
Can I?
Or should I trust him again ?
Day 17 of posting Corgi stuff (sorry for not posting for so long)
I have insomnia and I can’t sleep at night, and it’s just like I have so many ideas at night that just so many ideas keeping my up at night.
Please tell me how sometimes I can get better sleep.
Because of that, I almost failed school and because of skipped lessons, and people tell me to listen, but just, like, I talk with somebody, and then I just think of something.
I forgot what I was about to say, and I had a math tutor, but iI couldn’t focus and just also my mind is like chaos people.
Tell me.
Oh, I don’t want to take medication and I’m sensitive to medicine.
Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that.
She probably already has one also.
A real digital movie camera costs so damn much.
So I opted for an analog one.
Now, 8mm/Super 8 have an affordable price, 16mm doesn’t cost much, and 35mm costs a lot, so I think I’m going for a Super 8.
But then how does it work?
lol, I mean, I buy her a Super 8, but I should also buy her a video recorder, and some VHS… things like that.
I don’t know how it works.
Please can someone explain to me what should I do.
How do you guys do it?
It’s so scary, but I want to last forever with him, and I know I can’t tell the future, but we’ve been through so much together.
How do you guys keep it going through all the obstacles life throws at you... how?
Do you want to run some Minecraft? XD
I’m bored and my friends are busy or out right now, so...
I finished the game for the first time today.
What a wonderful and amazing game.
It hits right in the feels and fucks your mind up at times.
My ending was sad.
Kara and Alice die (I am bad at controls), North dies, Hank dies, Marcus is successful, but I let Connor kill him, because I guess I was doing kind of a role-play where Connor is the villain and the outcome is realistic.
I will try to open other openings.
But yes, the game was so good.
Hi guys, this year was my third year at Glastonbury, and I loved it so much and hope you guys did too!
Maybe a little earlier, I don’t know, because I’m usually at work, but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mb/s range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more people are at home I’m going to see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60…
I am an aspiring doctor/medical student, and so seeing a lot of medicine-related subjects as early in our first semester I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!
I passed for UPLB BS Biology!
To be honest though, this wasn’t my priority program, so of course I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be a scholar, but I was also worried, because I’m not really as interested in Biology as invested I already was in Physical Therapy.
Sure, I could learn to love Biology, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year, but that’s not certain.
I will play with anyone on 2K21.
I’m an 87 over 3 level scorer.
As one that will play with anyone, REP and OVR don’t matter.
I have no one to play with most of the time, and no randoms want to play with me.
Please play with me.
I promise I won’t sell.
I can shoot.
I have an 81 three, but I can shoot.
I’m a shooting guard.
I need someone who knows how to land planes on PC to help me.
That’s all.
I just need you to land the plane.
I know how to do the rest of the mission, but the plane has been messing me up for hours.
Please help as soon as possible.
My discord is SingSong254.
Contact me there, then I’ll give you my Ubisoft account information.
Thanks.
Help, I need someone who knows how to fly planes well on PC to join me.
Let’s fucking go!
What’s up guys?
I drop around 30 kills a game right now, and I’m trying to get out of low ranks and get into Platinum.
If you’re good at the game but simply don’t have a Stack, add me on Discord and we can rank up together.
Just to clarify, when I say “anything” I mean anything within the FM’s current power.
So no answers like “remove the nukes” or “boot the royals”.
We cannot do that (not yet at least…).
You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.
What do you do?
Me and my real life friends need a team that we (or especially I) can VOD review in order to learn about tarping, switching layers and positioning.
I was thinking Wolf/Soldier/Wilkinson but I’m not sure if there are any better ones.
Preferably EU as we are EU, and some stuff happening is basically exclusive to EU, lol, but I guess it could be NAE as well.
Thank you!
Looking for someone to play with right now.
No toxics and no obnoxious people.
I don’t fuck with that.
18+ NAE.
I just play for fun.
You can be bad.
I don’t care about skills 😇
One word I simply can’t say properly is water...
It actually hurts my brain trying to add the T, and I sound American if I do or still say wut-ta.
I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to say, to be honest.
I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when you meet people who drop H’s and have glottal stops.
I’m curious how likely it is that a post on my personal space will be shown to people. Please write “+” in the comment if you see this.
So I got a Sky Q Mini Box for upstairs.
It doesn’t work.
I have to wait until late March for an engineer. lol
So I will be starting a job next week and desperately need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
Looking for single bedroom flats or flat-shares is a legitimate issue as three letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
Vacuum won’t stop sucking.
Please send help.
Is it going to blow?
Basically, if you didn’t know what that is, it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Let’s eat granny” making it seem like someone’s going to eat their nan.
However, the other example says “Lets eat, granny”, implying a different meaning to the sentence.
A pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas, I guess.
I literally couldn’t have been more at fault I just drove straight into this woman’s Golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it).
She seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it’s my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers as well, just very minor body work and paint, maybe a small dent.
What broadband do I get?
I’ve had Virgin for 8 years, and holy shit, is it slow for £40 monthly.
Is it the old router or do I just switch to a cheaper BT or whatever?
Jeans, T-shirt, steel-cap boots, boiler suit (lol), high vis, gloves, goggles, dust mask, ear protection.
Help.
I’m melting…
Edit: the heat has got to my spelling ability first.
The end is nigh.
I’m sure as eggs is eggs that I’m not the only one that goes to the gas pump, and I want say £10, 9 times out of 10 it will go £10.01.
Bloody things are rigged like a slot machine, I swear, lol.
lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn’t actually laugh to.
LOL - adults and people who don’t really know how the internet works use this
Lol - I’m not sure why this came up, but it’s likely an autocorrect, but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named.
LoL - Grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
It’s also confusing because of League of Legends.
loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with “spool”, but I think it’s the drawn-out “o”.
So yeah, I think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn’t exist.
lolll - when I hear her say “loool”, this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it.
but I still think that’s “loool”,
You can’t repeatedly pronounce a consonant.
So, when is Big Ben going to bong again?
Hm, mandatory title.
But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Preferably under £50!
Also, does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming (that don’t require me to stand for lengths of time).
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what I do, I literally can’t keep the dust at bay for more than 24 hours, and I am losing my mind.
It’s 10pm, 28°C, and my bum is literally melting.
Saturday session three and chat.
If this bear isn’t named Beary McBearface, we have failed as a society.
It’s 32°C here inside my flat.
I have taken the t-shirt off and soaked it in cold water.
I’m wearing it.
What genius ways are you keeping cool whilst working from home or somewhere extremely hot with no AC?
Bloody lovely fucking weather, isn’t it?
16 hours in Wetherspoons.
Okay, so I went out with my girlfriend to go to 7-11 and I had my hair in my face, a hoodie, and a mask, and someone called me he/him.
Bruh, I’m so happy right now, what the fuck (I’m non-binary and use all pronouns, but nobody has ever used he/him for me and it feels really good)
To the neighbor that went out of their way just to check on me, I appreciate that.
I just wanted to say from one Gen Z to Millennials, good on you guys.
I hope you find what you’re looking for.
It’s been fun being your little buddies in life.
If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet, everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really, to be honest.
Remember, there’s a lot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that doesn’t experience a lot of positive moments, this subreddit does make me smile :-)
Damn, some people need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet, Jesus!
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kind of a lot, lol), so I would really appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I don’t see the need, because who the fuck cares?
But now it seems that you’re all making grits without the butter and making us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were preparing to tour more plantations than Carter’s got little pills but you done gone and brought up them “slave owners” now.
It isn’t amounting to anything more than a hill of beans!
If I had my druthers, I’d have just taken my business over yonder to the white-friendly plantation and learnt something decent about history.
All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
You get along now, do you hear?
How to go from number to date?
How do I break off a relationship with my “friend”?
Basically, I put my skate account in my Instagram biography, because I have no posts on my main, and I’m kind of insecure about my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless, and people won’t expect me to be like shredded or some shit if they add me), and today I got 3 followers (girls from different towns who don’t know me).
I’m really picky though, because I don’t want to have a relationship, unless I actually feel like I’d really like the person and be into them a lot, so I didn’t follow any of them back.
Bro, I’ve been added and un-added on Instagram so many times today that it’s kind of a confidence boost, lmao.
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from people who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers, smh… I have nothing else to say, come at me angry people, lmao.
Hi guys, I’m a casual just-for-fun gamer, playing 5-6 games a week.
Yesterday it was just pure horror division 10…
I could not win 1 game out of 6…
Like, is everyone smurfing ? Or what’s going on?
I know people want to play the objective.
I get that, but why do you need to shush or watch full replay or every cut scene?
So basically, for my A-levels I got 82 RP and wanted to go the NUS business administration but didn’t get in, though I’m quite sure my grade is good enough, and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago…
*welp
* :-(
I got into SMU business administration, but I still feel damn shit that I didn’t get into NUS, so help change my mind and convince me why SMU is better than NUS, especially for business :-/
I’m most scared that in the future when I’m working, people will look down on SMU like elitism discrimination all that, I don’t know, man.
Or will they pay less or not even hire me?
RIP, because SMU is kind of 2nd best and less well known.
I would really appreciate if you all could help me out, especially those who are currently at university or have already left.
Thanks pals :-)
TLDR: the title.
Other vegans that you’re friends with tell you that they don’t tell other people that they’re vegan.
Like, they purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community, because they are probably the people that would be more gentle with their words, which is what some people need in order to listen.
I’m a very straightforward, no sugarcoating type of person, and although some people appreciate it, a lot more get upset and start trying to put words in my mouth and twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like €300 worth of fake internet points, like, what the fuck are you doing, honestly? lol
Why would you give awards to people? lol
I just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre-googling and confirmed the time that I’ll be there.
If she gives any further resistance, I think I’ll just next her, ignore her, not respond to her, agree with her that she can’t handle the place, or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first freaking date.
Yes, I agree things like Tumblr made-up identities are weird, and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted, calling people snowflakes is just weak.
Give yourself a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without any unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series!
Props to you!
The New Year’s Eve Raticate with a hat.
I haven’t found him anywhere yet.
Does anyone want to raid?
I need a few people quick.
Stop.
I think what I am trying to say… this game is not hard.
Don’t make it hard yourself.
The main objective, as I understood, is to get the dragon, and don’t die before that.
Even better if you outfarm your opponent.
Just don’t die.
And trades in lane… if you see the enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights, but he was out of town.
So we couldn’t do that, and now he’s back in town, and I asked him what he’s doing on New Year’s Eve and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers from our work.
And like, he didn’t offer an invite, and then he said if he cancels with them, would I like to come over, and I just said I don’t know what I’m doing yet, so I don’t know.
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There are going to be people on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid.
Hey, the regulars!
I just wanted to say that I love the group channel, it’s amazing, and love your own channels as well.
I love all your videos, and I have a suggestion for a video for the channel: Do a Minecraft build battle and whoever loses there, the other people get to write something on their Twitter, lol.
I hope you like my idea and can use it for a video.
I have a group chat.
It’s on Discord for people who are bored or want to chat about anything.
We already have some people who chat and stuff about anything.
It’s chill, edgy, and if you want to join, comment and I’ll direct message you the link.
I just kind of realized that I’ve never had New Year’s Eve plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that…
I recently realized that I still don’t have enough friends to have one for my 21st coming up…
I don’t know why I didn’t clue into this though.
Like, I never thought about how people have traditions for this night, besides my sister, who goes out to her friends’ every year.
It’s funny that Covid isn’t affecting my New Year at all…
Is anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway, I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight, lol.
Hello, I’m looking for people to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
Just please be aware that I’m not very good at upholding conversations.
uwu F/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the Word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the “aaa” word, and I want to yank four words without selecting the spaces after “ddd”: > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like, I see videos on YouTube on it.
But like, I can’t see any mention on the design notes, etc. Where do people get the information from?
DM me to debate.
Please be well learned in your belief.
I want DMs, because it’ll get deep and I can’t reply to 300 people like that.
Also, I need 500 characters so here come the blah blahs.
I’m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I’m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl, but I am saying that they won’t like to do it, because they are humans with their own choices, and not agreeing to be a girl isn’t making them a women anti.
Like, how many guys around you would be willing to be turned into Disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time but how much time?
And maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
But knowing this isn’t making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they are asked to do all this.
I wouldn’t like it if you tried to make me a man and wanted me to dance in front of so many people, even though I am a tomboy.
Is anyone missing me?
If you miss a Reddit friend, read this.
It could be me!
So I just hopped on PC from PS4, not even 2.5k games played there.
I played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a keyboard and mouse, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with people 2000 kills and predators even.
Yet I haven’t even a hundred games played and about 80 kills with all characters.
I’m not really having fun anymore.
I can’t improve if I get shit on every game.
I see a lot of people on here who seem hella sad, so if you’re really sad, I’m up for a chat.
So yeah if you are up for a chat, or long-term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so.
So I always see people talk about sending designs and edits to Affinity, but how do I do that?
I’ve worked at OD for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it.
Like not even the print suppliers.
We do every type of editing in store and I hate it.
Like we’re out here doing stuff that I’m pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to Affinity based on what I see on here.
But yeah, is more of this information on the store portal or where can I learn more?
I’m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last-minute, rude customers :-)
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k, and I was like “Hell no, that’s not worth 100k”, like bruh.
Why do people find the new set expensive?
I know the girl I posted about is a troll people, but oh well, she’s got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down.
It is the bar with the team composition and the status of each character that is used to follow “report team” (like in the actual World Cup).
It can be tweaked down to not reveal too much information about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier, and you won’t have to use tab.
Hit me up with a chat message.
Tell me about yourself and we can go from there.
I don’t understand how people can build what they do...
I love building but I guess my creativity isn’t well tuned as a lot of people’s is, and it bothers me that I can’t build amazing stuff.
I know I could if had the creative side, ugh!
I just tend to give up after a while and settle for simple crap to pass for ok.
I care about how I affect people a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in conversations with big groups of people, which is related to ADHD.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kind of stand-offish to people I don’t know.
I’ll try to act like I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me but drunk people will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all are ADHD things though, because of rejection sensitive dysphoria.
I’m a good listener.
A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent.
I can have a really, really, really flirty personality at times.
I remember in high school, my friend’s mom said I had the “personality”, so I’d probably be the first to have a boyfriend.
But when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds her accountable, she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects anyone/everyone who doesn’t agree with her and screams about how she doesn’t care.
Or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck”.
She’ll never take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite.
All the things she screams at people to not do to her, she turns around and does the exact same rude, petty shit to anyone/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her.
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts just like my mom, and my mom can’t stand it/accept that So she becomes downright nasty.
In class, I’ve usually been really quiet, but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click with in class and be really, really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen B, feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk though.
I’ve always been a smiley, happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have ADHD.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really, really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk - I heard people with ADHD are both.
Could I be ISTP?
Help type me please.
I don’t know if people would even want to.
I just want to know if that’s allowed, and if not, where would be a good place to post that.
(I’ve watched Dragonmar and other people’s videos but that would be hard to be a me-specific video on there)
Like in a good way though.
Some people are just indescribable.
I haven’t done this before, but I’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like…interests :-)
We can definitely talk about anime (especially romance - I’m a sucker for it), we can talk about games and go into detail about lore and stuff, creepy stories go hard, and really I’m just down for anything :-)
I’m not gonna be weird so long as you’re not weird.
Any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah… if I didn’t do this right let me know :-)
Oh and I’ll absolutely talk more on Snap.
The part I’m humming is like “word word word wo-o-o-ord” twice.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like “fly-y-y-yyy.”
I’m pretty sure it’s a popular song; I’ve heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah, to be honest it is.
I care about a lot of people and I can’t just... make people be happy.
But like… I want to :-(
I just want to make everybody I care about happy.
Like, is that too much to ask?
I think that some people here are AI or something.
smh, don’t even try.
I can do that by myself 🤠
Hey, F/19, bored as fuck.
I enjoy talking to new people.
Hit me up!
I started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90’s.
She said everyone was watching wrestling back then, and it was a cool thing.
Now no one gives a shit 😭 (I don’t really blame them sometimes).
I asked her “why do you think people stopped liking it”, and she said “because it’s garbage.
It’s come on Fox on Fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hits, I change the channel”.
I had to include that in there, because she’s so funny 😂😂😂
Anyways…
Hey, I can’t fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting.
Hit me up if you think we could hit it off well.
I hope we have a great time, future chat buddy ;-) 😁
It’s kind of weird, I’m not going to lie.
These motherfuckers can outrun, outswim or outstam (through venom) anything that tries to get them.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
I just finished the show so I’m a little behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much, lol.
Also by sidestory I mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
My favorite Obama quote: "Michael and I also wanna uh, acknowledge, uh.....yy...y.yy..uuuhhh..yyy....your son Jack, who deployed today."
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc
Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best game ever that I play!
But have some probs..
I’d always heard of mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple months ago and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists rn.
Anyways that was just my thoughts,
Happy new years everyone
hope the new year treats u well.
Now for this one it's kinda hard because the enemies are SOOO COOL for this game, but... If I had to choose, I'd say I like the Clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not THE only enemie in the game that doesn't have a single other Variation from what I remember.
Honestly I wasn't gonna make one but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I dsagree with a lot of others list,
not to say my list is right bc this is all subjective anyway which Is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!
YAYYYY
Imo lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind ive only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of ep 3)
unlike her father lily tries to work with lee and for the most part the group
she does what she has to
she is a bit of a bitch cause she has to
i only have 1 problem with lily
she killed carly
if you could get ben to confess
yes i got spoiled on that and a few other things
ben is useless
he is what looks like a collage student yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7
pls dont downvote me into oblivion if i missed something
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats
so 4 isn't really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kinda sucks IMO.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who lived both as a woman and as a man
(not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders)
so thats kinda neat imo
I don't think he did the role justice.
I feel before neo figured it out the way he was speaking was ok, but after...IMO he should of went full Hugo weaving speech.
Just wanted to share my opinion not being a united fan, on the game against burnley.
(not that many of you will care).
Mctominay sheeeeesh what a guy.
Thought that shaw was solid,
now youve got two good left backs in good form.
Also wanted to say awb had a muhc better game i thought.
AFter the shitty games and dalot playing well I personaly thought awb improved alot.
Hahaha.
OMG it's terribl-....yyy funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can ONLY drop at 4-6,
yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues but for me I can live with those issues but not this,
pls change
Kind of an odd question imo, but I have a bp who I just got to eat f/t for the first time (yay!!!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I've tried f/t large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
Could be a fluke though.
Ik it's like a meme or something of "dark souls player complains about the combat" or something similar, but I just don't get the combat.
I can do ds3 deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately,
ik not a difficult game but hear me out rq if you know the game.
OMG!
WHY do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they dont have ANY idea of how a torrent even works (its so damn easy though!)
comments like "The link doesnt work" Rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
Your just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So i get tipped on the app, gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the app after?
Wtf is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was LESS than the app tip...
If your are tipping both, TIP BOTH.
Ngl tft is a good mode ,but its like hs a good game to play on your phone not something to grind out all day all night like wtf ?
Its not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on prep up and alt tab until its next time u can do anyhing)
any thoughts?
i know its a scientific things and all but some of the post there is just too much.
learning dream languages???
wtf?
and some bloke is saying "i tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didnt lucid dream?!" every few hours.
maybe the post are just giving a litte too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like Dear lord wtf is happening ooooh
So I am I first time cup user and i got the saalt cup at target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold+17yovirgin=ow)
I got in in w/the 7 fold and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how tf am i supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails.
In one way, it kind of helped me ~find~ the cup lowkey grip but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping
I'm down to my last dollars soon and I can't just eat beer and cigarettes
then I set them down so I didn't have to carry them across the street to get beer (it's cheaper at Adventures First Stop)
then I walked back and forgot my groceries
walked all the way home and ah shit, I'm getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill
I live on a hill. down. the middle, really.
i imagine it's like an amateur San Fran
so I walked back and got them.
no crime round these parts.
not much, anyway.
Didn’t think about nails...
Is he gonna tell her?
If so how would that convo go down?!!!?
Okay wtf Arlo now knows sera ( idk how to spell her full name) is Johns weakness
First of all, we've seen they are greedy as f(OK, not as other mobile studios, but stiiiiiill)
Second, game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high end phones)
Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
Wtf are you yanks on
See also:
(on an article about how it's "40 degrees in some parts of Europe")
> wtf lol that's not hot at all
put on a jakcet dummies
("[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16C")
> zomg thats rly cold
im never moving to canada
Someines it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me tf out and gives me nods similar to codiene,
why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with wether or not a woman looks at me and thinks Im ugly,
if that happens I get anxious From it,
but ifva women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks im decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
WTF IS GOING ON
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisble, even if they don't detect you they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I shouldve just grabbed an smg and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many trys most of them being on his second phase,
his 3rd phase I beat first time.
I got 7 place on last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Becuz i have less than 3000 points.
(i need 55 magaki frags and i get 50, just feel my suffering)
Also in other event with gamer764 i have \~8000 points and got 4 place and got rewards for 4 place, not for 1,
whats need 7k points or more.
Are the developers too greedy?
Hope the title makes sense -
Have a list of names "john.baker" (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 colums "john" and "baker"
Thanks!!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were goin to see each other and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday and so I canceled it and now she won't stop saying sorry that's not what she meant.
Wtf do I do
I told her I was going on another one next month(lie) to make her feel better but I didn't.
But, I don't neccesarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks
Okay so I've got less than a chapter left in GotM and I still can't understand wtf Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I'm missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots
Yhall are whack
Wtf i posted a litteral anime foot and still didn't even make most controversial post of DAY. let alone all time
So huh you cant alpha karthus ult
wtf is this bs?
It would be very helpful all of you OP's out there actually said wtf it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it!
Such as "now I understand why this (brand name) thing has everyone going crazy"...
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn't mean much to me.
If it's too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever that the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the "DFW teams are cursed" camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me to much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential WTF transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a pc but in the mean time I use a crappy 13 year old pc
I got money for rust bought it and it took 4 hours to download 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server
after I hit a tree with my rock my game crashed

GF: This isn't meant for kids.
GT: But its mine I found it and finders keepers.

She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot n cold.
Now shes onto another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind if disrespectful to the new bf huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd,
however, i will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her but i cant think of a reason why i should…
After going "uhh no?" She sends me a picture of said candle holder.From her kitchen.
I of course go "wtf you're home??" and turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So Im beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
Tldr: sickly nmom went into hospital for 3 days,
I find out shes home because of a candle holder.
ts been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but its really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is i let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message i sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful bc of a song i made that i was sharing.
I was very flirtatious maybe more so than i was with my gf when i was first talking to her and that has been choing in my gfs mind.
Its been extremely difficult for her
we have two dogs now
i was hoping us having two pups to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again bc we have them to bond over but she still cant say "i love you too"
she doesnt accept when i try to give her compliments bc ive said rude things in the past when i use to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you but i dont see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trumming my nails, wearing versace crystal noir and ither fragrances etc. Which i believe is the reason why most girls even if theyre taken at least are willing to have a convo with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self development and even though ive been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, i never let it get me down and im so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women even though i may not have hollywood good looks or charidma like will smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and i wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :)
Shes 18 inches long & weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
Just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champ every 4-5 days and shes already longer than some males get so I'm curious!
the anime is about an mc thats in a game but she doesnt realise it but the system says shes dead and etc
i would like to wath the rest of it soo plz help me.
Lookking for a anime
Idk if to others its strange, but to me it was.
I got covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so i had to tell my mum.
I couldve just lied and say it was cuz of sharing cups or kissing a girl since in BI, but i knew my parents would be accepting...
so i told them as it was.
My mum was VERY dissapointed because she thought she new me well, and though i told her everything but now she couldnt trust me anymore cuz bla bla bla...
basically he was very dissapointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that i didnt feel like telling her because its private to me... till today
she doesnt really trust me like before, but shes ok lol.
Today its my birthday so im sharing my ''strange'' comming out story
I am confusion???
whats going on lol.
This is my first time with sfu mail,
after the sem I haven't touched anything school related until today heh, so idk how to fix this
So me and my friend started playing val again and want us to learn comms such as heaven and all of that,
now I know what heaven is but I don't know others and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If your still confused ill give a scenario "I hit the jett, shes in heaven" like the location.
Shes an awesome cook does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but shes not a good cook either LOL.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating well
she cant be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or its a guy)
She's all nice and sweet to everyone else but she's just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong(not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it. Which is wrong,
when she is there she doesn't do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren't there.
The worst part about it is people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The "false advertising" on thr A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill were it says multiple buffs cant co exist.
Maybe im the only one but i think this is all dumb and alsp kills a lot of peoples excitement.
I dont like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star lol.
Its just like zhongli.
He was fine but everyone freaked because he wasnt doing enough to dumster content and was balanced.
Ive seen lots of ppl in the fandom make rude/racist comments about liberty and its disgusting
please leave her alone.
And you do realize shes black?
stop making fun of the actors ethnic features
its honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general
its not even funny
honestly its just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And its not even just liberty I've seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmys hair.
(also mods please dont take this down
I really want people to see it and I have done nothing wrong
I've been having some of my post randomly deleted for no reason)
( As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guac.)
She then told me we gave her less meat when I brought back THE SAME PLATE sans guac.
SHES HOME FOR THE FIRST TIMEE
SHESS FINNALLY BACKK
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my pup im her crate at night bc if i dont she will poop on the floor.
So theres already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then i have work - which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my corgi in my bathroom at this time because if i dont she will reek havoc unsupervised.
AITA for starting a fight with an old friend (Strong Swearing)
Even better for me it would be:
It would be an unbeleafable loss to leta broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, downthe sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of themerchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.
"Y-y-yyy-yes sire! May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!”
"Now get lost! This is no place for desease ridden vermin like you.”
"O-off course my lord!”
I ran. Back down the alley I squirmed my way out of. Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went. Further and furhter out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on snapchat with my friend,
me and my friend were arguing as a "joke" and then she said she prefered older guys, and my friend was (M14) and i said im a year older than you, and she says "what i mean by older guys i mean age 17" and it hurt my heart.
TLDR; my crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and im 16 and shes 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here but idk if I am the butthole or entitled one this story,
this is short but I was expecting to get a tat for my 18 bday like any 18 year old but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to
I dm the artist I wanted but nothing for 2 months
like yea I understand they booked for summer tats but at least say "hey I am booked for the rest of ____"
but I was like ok will I am gonna look at another artist work from this shop that does small tats
same thing happens no answer
so me and my brother decides "ok let's go to the shop and ask then we well at least get a answer"
we go and this young girl attends us lets call her (brenda)
I told her everything,
brenda said "well u can do the tat with me"
I said "I'll be back i'll think about it"
I got back in the car and scroll through her work
it was good work so I went back and told her yea let's do this
I signed everything
she didn't even ask for ID which I found weird bc I gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on
I brushed it off since shes new and all
she worked on me for a hour told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her
I was like ok great thanks,
4 weeks passed and there was alot of mistakes made bc I got a small tat heartbeat with a ";" in the middle but the period on top was a small heart
the right side of the heart was smaller then the other side and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again
So I reset it and yeah oops was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn't dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry ? and like through text she kinda sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if shes mad and like she said shes only abit let down ?
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me and like i apologized to her and she said its alright .
Then i just told her im going to sleep and she just left my message on delivered and like she didnt reply to today.
How to tell whether she's mad at me or just annoyed cuz rn im really confused
WIBTA if I was just be a bigger sarcastic Asshole to another Asshole?
Her tumors are behinning to open through her skin, she wont jump, pain killers dont help, she ate a lot yesterday but wont eat or drink today, she hid most the day but..... Its hard because shes alert.
It feels wrong because she looks at me like "i love you.
Im happy your here with me"
but the vet said she wasnt even supposed to live this long and the tumors will only get worse and even if we had done chemo, it would have only prolonged it.
friend told my girlfriend something,
she then broke up with me,
i dont know what to now because she and the ex friend where the only people that i had.
what should i do to try and regain my relationship because shes helped me through alot over our 2 years of dating
TLDR gf broke up with me bc something someone said and i want to regain relationship with my gf
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee bc shes a poc with tattoos and"fits the part" of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up bc I need to protect my staff but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex looooves kids.
She was playing captain save a hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman's situation with this girl's "crazy" baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in eachothers life.
it hasn't even been two months!!!
IM SO HURT.
SHE NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A LIFE WITH ME.
I KNEWWWWW she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, soon as he sawThat I was weeping, answer'd, "Come with me."
Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.
Ent'ring he led me with him on the boundsOf a great circle itself encirclign a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land with lava pyramids cover'd,With sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life Save for those imprison'd in it, who, though they surroundedUs, dar'd not approach for fear of master.
As mine ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, Cries, and explosions that made th' eternal airTremble, caus'd by slaughter, starvation, withering, and Grief felt by those multitudes, many and vast,Of men, women, and children.
Theyve grown out to the point they look kinda awkward and shes saying i should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something Id like better?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
SHE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME CLOTHES THAT FIT ME
IM DYINGGGG
SHES SO SUPPORTIVE AND NICEE OMGGG
So its 0:34 the first of January while posting this and my Sister (f14) just Ruined my New Year by Calling my Mum Fat and telling her shes a drinker when she Poured herself a glass of champagne, wich she only does on her Birthday on chrismas eve and on New year.
Now my Parents are pissed of, my grandparents are pissed off and my Sister thinks she was Funny.
The same thing happend on Chrismas eve and now the whole feeling of new year is gone and i hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sry for spelling
Screw INTJ’s.
Why they gotta be good at EVERYTHING?!
It was a MISTAKE getting the booster the day before new years.
I feel like absolute dog water.
literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and i almost cried🙏
im so happy bro.
shes so cool.
im gonna ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :)
also, happy nye/happy ny everyone!!
first of all, the satisfaction i get from saying i am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
a high i’ll never come off of.
second of all, customer comes in for the second time mad because i didnt do copies from a book because of copyright.
she goes "well i called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that".
and im like ?? ma’am its in our policy
idc what customer service says.
she keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes "make my copy"
like lol not when you act rude like that.
our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and shes such a cuddly, loving, little girl and i love her cuddles every night and in the morning
im just scared that she isnt gonna be like that after she gets fixed?
am i over thinking it?
do you think since shes in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she'll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I domt fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently shes been asking me if i'll fart infront of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and its weirf shes never heard me do it.
I can't believe she saying im depressed looking while shes so shy girl and weird thinking she's not,
so delusional
i hate it,but they are mine only friends,
she calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to d2 after several year, now I’m windering:
Where do you guys sell/buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game "O xxx N yyy" and hope for the best?
Or are there a website that’s more efficient?
Mine friends are mean and delusional,
one is immiture and shy and always pulling me down,
other is fine just jealous and its getting on my nerves,
what to do?
This is a set up I can live with.
My bf and my's fear however is in a few years when we're ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own bf.
I'm very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow anymore pushing of the boundries.
What do I do here?
Boundry Issues w/ my boyfriends alter
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was upfront when we met and said shes sh** at texting, and has apologies when we were speaking for slow replies, something which I said don’t worry, I know your busy!
Convo seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation,
however I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread) but she’s viewed my story & posted a story since,
it was NYE.
So i was all ready for the new year actually thinking positive and the changes im going to make etc
then i see hes posted a picture of them both that shes took saying 'love of my life'.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face
Exes bf posted a pic of them :(
Everytime i ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even tho shes older wtf) and that i shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her,
she drains the life out of me,
I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently ive been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, i could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brang herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great
im sooooo happy.
On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat.
I look on it again i see jane but this time i can look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So i just got my first beardie.
Hes only a moth old and like most new owners im worried about if hes or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day but so far ive only been able to feed about 6-7 crickets .
Ive tried feeding him some vegies too but the guy doesnt show any interest in them.
Is there anything Im doing wrong or is he just fine and im overly worried.
Then I foundout about this really cool website called Complex.
Theyre sort of like journalism but better since theyre all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through complex.
before I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic but travis scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
now i like tame impala and ive started dressing weirder, i bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully ill wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromitise himself/herself on social media?
is it just me cringing at the twitter posts by albatross?
everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
hes making it seem like xvg is a sinking ship atm and its doing fine.
soo i have this friend IRL.
man the dude is known everywhere.
hes got a solid rep in the streets, in the jails, everywhere this guy goes everyone knows him.
he was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on reddit because i feel like i'm not really known.
how do you get hella karma?
Im 21 hes about to be 23,
my issue is that he seens to have no ambition anymore,
he doesnt work and doesnt make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an emt,
he failed it the first time by 2 points and I think he fears failure that he doesnt really want to try anything anymore.
Hes been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
Ive gotten super smough about 5 times but i always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear im far enough away but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
Im using 2H battle axe +10gargoyle helm and naked (even with tattered armor it doesnt seem to make a difference)Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know throwing myself at them enough times ill get them but its slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do but i seem to always get caught in a dumb combo or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or noticed the letter I put in there, annnd now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you, you read this sentence wrong too?
*WELL NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION*
I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :^)
19/F Aww shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time
If I just wana make draven my 1 carry how should i do it.
I know hes a good unit but what items can turn him into a god.
I tried heali g sword n rfc but i get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character
however his shield is gun is op and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets thats fine.
However I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate because it got absorbed.
Idk about other players oppinions but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so hes not op evough to counter everything.
Tell me what you ppl think
I didn't think anything of it so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him the EK started screaming "MOOOOOMMYYYYYY HE STOOOOLE MY COOOOOOKIES!!!"
At first I was startled
i started to get nervous and i froze.
Then EP walks up and starts yelling "GIVE THOSE COOKIES FROM MY DAUGHTER GIVE THEM BACK!!"
And I did not know what to say at first but then something came so mind just say " but I didnt."
But the way I said was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That's when my dad noticed (hes old sad he didn't realise a little bit ealier)
he called a manager to the seen and the manager told us to continue and he'll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We're both xxx majors (I'm a dual xxx and yyy major while she's a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn't say I'm smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I'm a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off.
I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences.
I looked over my bank stanments and there is was.
My NEW prim bill.
I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport.
They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.
The next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me.
We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed.
Both dated added up to what i had told her before.
She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tmrw im no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach put all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance and he messaged me on friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said i didnt change anything.
After that part of the convo ended i asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
he said that hes good when he doesnt think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him etc.
Day 1 of no contant starts tmrw.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster
we used my name and ill credit his Instagram below
hes a good guy
im glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and or story
would you guys like either home made lore or not?
i could=t post this on the fallout Reddit for some reason,
wouldn't let me put the photo
hope its good guys!
is it even possible for itsoktocry to blow up outside of the 3 songs hes had do extremly well?
Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for awhile and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much i despises griefers because they dont just destroy something in a game they destroy HOURS of work and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying im mean if i dont go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non stop how im 'mean' or a 'bad person' because im busy doing something so i cant go give him his shit.
Well I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I dont see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy,
we do get slightly tipsy ya know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a fb message saying hes ready for her to leave (she'd been there 2 hrs at this point) and then he starts passive aggressive cleaning in front of us.
Hes going through a divorce so he keeps telling me thats taking all his money.
I didnt give him a title as I didnt even get one when i bought it.
It was salvage from some guys as a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale but I've long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do y'all think its not worth it?
Also if I did want to how would i?
So I just told this guy in my class who was also weird af and gave it to him saying oof I sat on jt it broke do u just want it.
Hes like no ew.
I have ocd and immediately got ashamed and was like lol whys it gross
it's the same as a whole one and along that line like lol why and he was like ok oof it's not and I'm like lol why did you say that.
I was saying it jokingly but I'm afraid I looked weird
like wtf
whys she upset or playfully upset that I dont want it.
My hooman staff cooms home tastin of sos ages and cheez.
I think she has anovver fluff she is makin treets for.
Shud I bee sad or anger?
Wat duz yur hooman taste of wen they coom home?

anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday i finally mustered up the courage to message him.
me: hey how's everything
him: it's been time
me: sorry abt last year,
i was super awkward around you lol
him: lol nah dwai
*DRUM ROLL PLEAAE*
me: tbh i liked you blah blah blah
him: haha you could've just told me!
next time you see me just say hi.
do you still go to (school)?
I'm not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn't sit well with me.
Hey gyz just wanted to share this helpful app with you all :D .
Its not tht i am trying to promote this app or something,
it really helped me a lot
thts why thought it might evn help u gyz out .
I 've seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team ovr's and many are thinking to buy players but cant decide which will boost their team ovr's the most .
This app helps to calculate the ovr of ur team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people(f2p players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team ovr since it will result in a huge loss of coins(coz of 10% EA tax).
Whats the wecommended amount of wedicated wam i shud have to servur?
IF u r readin this, u shud b ashamed ov yurself,
u shud b sleep,
go 2 bed i say

Just small info, I'm 5'9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k but I really can't hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical "u shud be good but ur not so im gunna giveu unrealistIC GOals", or should i be at 1:49?

This was received rather poorly, earning me some disapproving comments.
Arent u all tired of seeing atleast the first two jumping into battle and wiping out ur whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying if they werent here then well the game would be balanced,
well i beg to differ cos theres akai with his insane disruption and diggie with his timely ulti or maybe even irithel might be banned cos of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly the king and queen of this game is lancelot and his beloved fanny.
Yoo know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O desidez to go to gym to do kwik workout, whatever dat iz.
She sez to me, "Yoo leave steak alone, doggo. Yoo be gud gurl!"
She tied plastik bag reel tite around steak.
Hahahaha!
Then she goes into gym and when she comez bak many furevers later, GUESS WHAT??
Hahahaha!
She open tiny car and look at me and look at steak bag....and she say, "GUD GURL!!!
Yoo leeve steak alone!"
And dat is da storee of me bein' gud gurl.
Mom-O sez she shud have brought steak into gym and left on bench next to her wiff her sweatshirt.
Sez she dum not to think of dat.
Mebbe Mom-O will git smart in a few furevers.
Now I obviously can't get out and shut it on the main road so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I've quickly jumped out and shut it.
I jump back in and drive home like nothings happened.
My bed smells like disease

Pls send me some tips n stuff on what to teach him.
Currently hes doing pretty good, though the only thing he buys is shotguns because thats the only gun he gets kills from.

I recently had surgery and am not ment to lift too much or stretch but felt OK n thought I could do it alone .
I can't,
I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of walls were I can't reach .
He said yes n today came to do it ,
after a bit said he was done and leaving,
I gave him £20 n said how greatful I am for the help .
Checked room once he left ...
both kids beds full of torn off we wallpaper , draws cracked where he stood on ,
iv still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent last 45 min picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds ,
aita if I confront him about the mess or shud I let it go n not bother asking in future
my boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when i ask dumb questions (example, i didnt know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said "why is it hard….. just fill it"
so i tried to do it but i failed.
later he was like "babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?"
then when i do it myself and dont ask him he goes "why dont you ask me, i can teach you/help you" but i refrain from asking becuz he gets frustrated
The last couple calls had arguments as he got mad cuz I beat his ass in video games (even tho gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked abt him to lots of my irl friends and they all ask why I continue to be his friend and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only ppl who actively tries to interact w him online.
yeah Ik shoes don't match.
they match the graffiti tho !
I'm trying alot of different styles so lmk what I shud change
hat: sicko by Ian conner

what shud i do lol
I don't remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida there's a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100× longer than when it's not making a sound.
I'd describe it as that trademark dessert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff , and … it’s just dude wt… heck it’s weird ,
so maybe it’s BOTH sort of a paradox (life is) but I just wanna know Hinestly did anyone else feel it ?
I want a logical explanation Plz , n if one don’t exist well I mean cuz loooong before … I was "of age" so to speak … for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate cuz I don’t drink but I’ve … hmm I’m an adult let’s put it like that
there’s other stjfff out there but Long before thag me and myFamily saw a UFO
even mg step dad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall n like … it doesn’t really scare me cuz I think it’s the way life is
things change
they don’t always have to make sense , and others say that 2.

I reside in Hyderabad,India, currently pursuing my bachelors in computer science .
I am a candian citizen but,for enrollment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam .
Now,the doubt that has arose is...wud my admission be considered international or domestic?..
On a side note,how hard is it to be admitted to UoT's computer science program.
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
Wud preffer a hardcore clan with a plan. With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal / target, that also enjoy teamplay.
It's not a necessity but it would be nice.

Hi,I was wondering wheter or not it worths to drop some money on pets.
Like I saw how much some ppl can spend on them to get good results (like t4), and I wouldnt want to spend that much :D.
Currently I have 5 t1 pets, and I wouldnt mind to see some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping "just" 100$ would worth it.
Does it worth to drop 100$ on pets?
towards the end of senior year and tht summer idk what happened but i got a hot bod n my face was all "girl u been through some shit have a gift" so now im pretty?
I jus made a post on a diff sub about having a nice date today, which is nice, but i am vv hesitant on making frens n stuff cuz of the last two years.
so like, after my glow up or whatever more ppl started talkin to me ya?
n a lot of boys did too!
i never rlly had v many frens so this was a huge yay!
the first boy i hung out with was rlly nice but then we got high and i did vv regrettable things i do not like.
Well tht boy was super haps n told lots of boys.
I dont want to jinx it and call them out by name but im talking with a company and im hoping it works out!
Im excited about all things ill be able to do with these free promo products to help other ppl and possibly get them off some or all of their rx drugs!
Im excited for myself because i have a bunch of medical issues that i do not use rx drugs for and the other stuff i buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others and it will help this company as well.
Im ready, im ready!
Im hella excited!
Might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do - plants now waaay small for its age imo and started to grow pistils
- should I chop n restart or ???
Will be posting more here once I get...comfortable again.
(Self love is impt!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through ~ will get to them when I can :3
In the meantime, happy new year!!
ps: I don’t have a SC & don’t take any $$$, I just like to.. show off, y’know closet slut things :) lol
Ttyl y’all
He said "shhh just kis me you fool".
I still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said "No. You're f***ed up now.
Whats going on?"
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says "good lord wtf happened.
I gotta garden
ttyl".
He read my reply which said "I'm so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated".
I just don't know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him, but I don't want to be held in limbo.
I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know when ever I say ttyl or gn or whatever I wanna add an ily. Just casually. To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten fold.
I know sometimes I day dream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
Makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
Tbh I kinda hope it is bc I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof is it hitting me hard.
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I(will takes days or a week to respond) but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to atm.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick ttyl either tbh.
Finally they seem to want to engage w/ me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then day of.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on and it’s not like we’re really talking so I just block them.
Idk, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival,
I'm still "Ocean Serene" but maybe I'm .. idk that's a tough thing to say, I never thought that my gf was just a random,
I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said allot of things, I'm gonna agree that if I change the world changes,
the advice you get, it's allways iffy,
I want to speak for everyone but at the same time I can only speak for myself,
also I went to get some rum and coke,
I got coke and a few other people seen it so they bought some coke.. erm, I hope my friends are ok (that's all you weirdos I'm talking about)
random story I know,
tbh I'm not ok, but I'm surviving like usual,
actually I'm all just a bit Right and fine.
Ttyl
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, its 8 hrs to [redacted]. 7 to [redacted].
not a big deal
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles an hour drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] i spose [redacted] or [redacted]'s wife ratted me out.
maybe i should block them too
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you and we can see how well that went.
[me] shiiiiiiiiit. betrayal
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self gratification.
I was in a toxic rs for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our rs we were great.
One day both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
Im going to admit that sometimes when i feel jealous i just want her to reassure me like how i reassure her that its all good but she will only reassure me once and then said bye or ttyl.
Most of the time in an argument its always my fault,
she wont admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight wont continue anymore
And I said "But yeah yeah you right."
And he said "Ye well I gtg. Im doing something" and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe. When the convo started.
But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped.
Like what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doenst like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that.
If he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.
Idk what else to put Besides that i hate the current circumstance of life i live in
im gonna give a little insight tomorrow
Ok i lied
i have to reveal my age tomorrow because if i dont Itll mess up the story
Um Idk what to type so ill type a worry i have
Umm i dont think ill get the tapegun intime
Ok bye ttyl everyone
she said something like "but i want to make sure that we go as a friend?" thing and i was like "okay, i know" and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said "ofc i like my long time bf"
yea, whatever right haha
and here's my question...
yesterday when i was at work, she msg me saying something like "how's your work doing" and i kinda reply her with cold tone saying "i'm at work ttyl" and then she kinda upset :" Okay, i mean i understand you are at work so busy but u didn’t cut me off like this before so i kinda get it that you dont want to talk anymore like before.
got it!
bye!
How do you get destiny delicacies
I've seen a few ppl have them but I've never got one
idek where you get them
if anyone knows it would be alot of help☺
and my machine f!@#ing freezes up
it's been happening for like 2 days now...
this machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3d scanner but 4 browser tabs on reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% OF MY DAMN MEMORY AND 60% of my cpu power and freezes the wholedamn thing up.
HEY! WAIT!
i've got a new complaint! ..... Seriously WTF are you devs doing???
stahp plz
If you think it's rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying "gotta go I'll talk to you later" then it's also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one off,
things happen,
maybe something came up and you got distracted etc.
But EVERY SINGLE PERSON ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It's really not that hard to just say "gotta go, i'll text you later" or "so and so just got home, TTYL"
Even just "bye" or "BRB" or something!
Today i got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if i did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn't wanna ignore them just to talk to me,
i said it wouldn't be a problem if he had just said something like "i can't talk rn" or "im with my friends ttyl" or just literally anything.
He then said i was overthink stuf and i should " chill out" so i left it at that.
So AITA and over thinking things?
AITA for gerring mad at my bf after he ignored me for a few days
So I would usually post this on r/keto but that sub is soooooo intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But like, a girl’s gotta rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
Have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like "bitch, CALORIES PUHLEAZE"
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their no cheat days mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten free dairy free carb dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
Afaik, the concept of mini album is only around in kpop (maybe jpop?)
Im always dissapointed when a long awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5 songs album.
I can tolerate debut album since you really dont have a lot of material, but if youre snsd or something and you come out with mini after years long hiatus like mr mr, its kinda insulting.
idk what to say lol
i'm pretty funny not only bc i manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often but also because i'm just fuckin hilarious tbh
i'm from yorkshire and that probably makes me cooler than you bc the north is just superior and i'm ready to die on this hill but ig we can be mates
i would really like some of those
ok i'm running out of people to laugh at my jokes
17m from the uk,
pls be able to hold a conversation lol
Idek what kind of dog this was but it was so ugly
my god who would own such a thing.
Dogs with wrinkles like pugs, char pays(idk how to spell it), bulldogs, boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all, I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally be told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness/ over nose-can’t breathe)
and yes I know I’m gonna get shit on my all the fuckin neck beards on reddit that just ADORE their snot nose little pug,
idec
I’m so tired of people and they’re dogs.
Everytime i listen to him sht makes so much sense, even tho i dont know what he is talking about,
that leads me to belive that either that guy is a genius who can articulate whats going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something?
I mean what should i listen to if i rly wanna find out the truth if schiff is just "bias to Gold" and thats the reason why he is so hard on the current economy etc.
Do boobs=nice, coz idk never seen em before
then he check the oil level saying that the oil also smell like gasoline that gasoline and oil is mixing up together
open one spark plug see the massive leak in there literally full up
"let me say oil" smell like gasoline
I didn’t smell that one
that’s what the worker told me
then he call his boss and the boss say is not gasoline is just oil "that shit smell like gasoline 🤦🏾‍♂️
even the worker confirm that I ain’t crazy but ayyy maybe I am
and his worker" Told me he going to sealed the black thing that goes in top of the spark plug that covers it
"sorry my English not that amazing"
he said he was putting a sealed after draining the oil as he mentioned
is oil drained the oil sealed the thing so oil don’t drip out of it and don’t drip to the floor
but didn’t help me find the cause of why is oil getting into the spark plug because a sealed on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️
telling me if the problem keeps on is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way to much oil and is causing the oil leak that if the problems persist I will have to remove it
Sorry for the long paragraph but need advices,
need help tbh
My rabbit didn't eat or drink so I went to check him,
its been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food idk.
(He has constipation so Imma check does he poop.)
How do I sleep if i have to check out my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is gonna become chaotic lol.
i assume the time has already passed for this but idk i figured i may as well ask,
i kinda forgot i even had those tix until they announced they'd be touring again today
Now, my aunts (gma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated gma both before and after she passed.
When my gma first started getting sick, sis wasn’t the best bc she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but gma was also scared of covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job i couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back & forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
WIBTA if i didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So i mett this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dateing.
Last night everything was all right she was happy said good night anda ily like every night.
And the next morning when i texted her good morning she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad af all day because of me and but diden't want to say why.
Idk what i did.
I did nothing.
What should i do.
How can i contact her.
Should i give her space?
My gf blocked me and idk why
Mines ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in witch I have a F,
this is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I've done but are nowhere in the books,
this kinda snuck up on me cause I thought they were done and filed only to check my grades and find out they weren't.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you at going say "ikr I only have a 89, why couldn't she round up, fml)
Imma be honest that's not very helpful rn
so first off bard top
what a pick ikr.
lets drop down my main build cause its the best assasin play style i like.
* my core is static/ie/RFC.
now i tried many ways and this is the best way
i like to safely clear and lay out poke.
now under certain occasions like vs a garen id go what many would call shot gun bard swaping out static for runnans and if needed Rfc for pd.
giving some more tank..
now as for the other two i actually leave them more optional picks in the ap department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain
id pick up hextech gunblade
this item is phenomenal on bard on hits are great.
if your already carrying hard id go something like lyiandries cause with the lead no one will catch you with this and the chunk is just bardo crazzzzyyyy.
yet two try gunblade and lyandries together but someday.
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years; we're both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It's driving me crazy, how to deal?
This wouldn’t be an issue if y’all servers ask in the beginning do u guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.
Also why restaurants have to be set up like that
why u can’t just get up to the cashier and pay ur fucking share or food.
Hey guys bard main,
just join reddit after finding out there are other off metta bards!
So i main him top,
yes its scary but i do.
So i been getting alot questions about my builds from friends and happy on lookers lately!
thought i share my builds!
Im 16 years old 5'9.
Im new to basketball and id like to ask for drills i can do by myself so i can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I dont have a decent shot nor a decent handle,
i could barely reach the backboard plus i have no friends so dont even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why i wanted to be good at it so bad is because i just want people to know me as somebody cuz right now im a nobody,
i want to be SOMEBODY.
PS. Ive never played an actual basketball ever in my life.. ikr?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising ykno) but p chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when i want to be), goofy, a lil chaotic, big overthinker kinda deal.
Enneagram type 4 bc apparently that matters (jk !!!)
Honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love ... you get the gist :)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist so a program with med school prerequisites would be preferable,
plus, I plan to take my med school abroad (wow big dreams much?
I doubt I'd get in but it wouldn't hurt to try tho).
Academics aside, the community is also important to me,
I'd be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh and location too.
I'm short so if my classes are ~far~ I might as well roller skate my way through campus jk jk.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character.
Or, ya know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would've prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do
the player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now but I dont know if I want to pursue her
its complicated.
Right now its summer break so imma wait til school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person cuz they dont talk to me online lol.
I dont know how long this series will go but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I dont know how long this is gonna take but probably quite awhile.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I dont have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say, that if youre a kid, like an elementary school kid and youre here, where the fuck are your parents???
Lol nvm fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
Cause I got them and no one to give them too lmao jk unless..........
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium sprite and a mcdouble?
So idk why o got on everyone nerves about the separate checks....

I dont expect to get any messages but hey its worth a try.
Ps. I dont know how to write these properly so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format omo
Oh and if I dont reply soon it might mean Im asleep or playing DnD hehe.

Well I'm going to see if I can buy some stuff off steam now...
let's hope there's still some good sales
Okay so I was a totl noob and earesed my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was gonna use but I sent monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
or how do you open the .key file
edit: nvm I'm a complete noob
I figured it out.
Possible to retrive monero wallet seeds with .keyfile?

So i can guess ur gender based on ur post history
Nvm..lemmee guess ur gender instead
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the prof is Oct.18.
*(edit. nvm, this part isn't true pls disregard).*
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is Feb.9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the prof that I'm dropping the course,
do I also have to get permission?
I'm planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits btw.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I rlly wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like "what!?" reallyyy loudddly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say "nvm" cuz I felt like I was in the mf spotlight.
But every time, my nmom says that can't be true because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
"It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?"
Umm idk, maybe its bc we're DIFFERENT PEOPLE with DIFFERENT BODIES???
Tbh, have anyone ever experience fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn't die and manage to kill aleast one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch BUT rampage didn't pop his ult yet.
😲Wtf?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky af fighter, and a carry that solo everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1
When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.
I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, always. Possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in....
oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
like now I feel guilty for smiling.
nvm the fake ones ish, but fuck.
haha. ugh.
why am I still alive.
lol why tf does smiling hurt
Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME.
i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE.
HE SAYS "WHATS UP" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER.
I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS.
AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD.
IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING.
BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD.
I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS,
THEN I LOOK BACK UP.
PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS.
Edit: yes I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen. Useful, I know.
But URGHHHH. They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
Btw there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: nvm. I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance, oops now I'm not getting any mp!
Try to type in chat, "I will not cheat on this game!"
message repeats every time I hit enter.
WTF
im not cheating.
anyways I type those words into the chat ( "I will not cheat on this game!") and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Wort way to tell a player to turn off Adblock but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player
10/10 never play again
EDIT: nvm, anytime I type in the chat the same shit happens
I'm gonna skip the oscar-bait shit like The Post because there's only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Dems making movies about how (Extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) "politics used to be moooorrreeee poollliitte we neeeeed a return to The Discouuurrrse."
I'm sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.
2mo ago I bought a cheap '95 nissan truck,
I was only locally driving so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn't put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd **only** when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can't rev it past 3k in my driveway w/o feeling like I'm going to break something,
I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it,
it'll hit close-to 3500 right before gear-shifts)
I was trying to methodically rule-out what could be causing this power-sap, IE is it the air/fuel or a clogged cat/exhaust/etc or something entirely different?
I ruled-out 'different', I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in Neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone elses nmom treat you like you're overreacting about your period pains?
Hey! Read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangeroes,
is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2mo boston terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside
friends think she said that cuz she was w her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up etc.
others think its a way for her to be evil, like think of me cuz im never coming to get that charm.
i think its some type of hoover, good or bad.
any insight is appreciated.
if your a woman please tell me your perspective.
so confused, bt she is clearly w someone else and why she couldnt call me back and why she didnt respond to my txt msgs.
she couldve said im w my bf please dont call me bt she didnt.
Just a side note: my bf and i are buying a house.
we will be moving out in 2mo.
Once the papers are all finalzed.
I have an Australian shepherd 9mo.
My bf (24m) and i (25f) got her at 3 mo.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with a black lab and a dog small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a rat terrier.
Thier play style is boxing.
And one of my roomates (25m) has a beagle.
He doesnt like to play much
infact he seems kinda scared too.
i know all of these things about my dog.
i know that it doesn't matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise; doesn't matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business;
what matters is that my dog is nervous
-- so when i hold my hand out and tell you, no, he's not sitting or lying down because he's calmly waiting for you to say hi, it's because he's nervous and insecure, i DON'T mean it as a joke, and it's NOT an invitation for you to say, "AW WELL MY DOG/CHILD IS VERY FRIENDLY SO LET ME APPROACH!"
i don't care if your dog/child is friendly or "dog savvy".
i don't care if your dog "is just a puppy"
(why the hell is that even relevant?
is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies? ??????).
i don't care if your child is capable of not screeching "OMG A PUPPYYYYYYY".
can you, y'know, DO something about your child? and also your dog?
But with less than 3mo to go for that i feel I'm not ready yet but having never taken it I have nothing to compare it to besides collegues advice.
Without knowing what I know they can't know if I'm actually ready yet but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this...bad...amd it would be awesome to be done 6 mo from my intro exam.
I'm close... I just don't know if I'm 2mo study close.
Somm certified advice
(M/5'10"/26/165-195lbs) 2mo progress, gaining too much weight?
Passed my faa ppl written!!!
I know this sounds weird but heres my issue,
about 4 months ago i had an 3700X which died after start crashing when i tried to play games and a day later not booting,
send to rma, they confirmed the cpu was dead and gave my money back after 2mo,
after that i got an 3800X,
as soon as i tried got the boot code 7b everything power up but no reboots or video signal,
send to rma this time with the store
after 1mo they confirmed the cpu was falty send me a new one,
i got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom(T) has always been the type where her feelings matter 1st + only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone elses fault entirely.
Ex: I needed some1 to babysit our then 2mo for 3-4 hrs.
Dads work had som1 who had COVID,
we opted out of them watching our son + askd my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her *before* I set it all up b/c I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its *my fault* \+ she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her *days* after the incident b/c she didnt call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing,
T promptly got off the phone,
I nvr got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to Ts narcissism.
I dont expect an apology from T b/c she **nvr** has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
WIBTA for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5mo, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2mo he's co-sleot with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I've been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get 2mo baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (Currently replacing pacifier every hour)
FTM to a sweet 2 month old girl and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
FTM struggling with sleeps
So i already have an orange golden chinchilla ( toto - 2mo old) and we have had toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got terri (2 mo himalayan ragdoll) too keep eachother company.
Its only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor?
just always goin "bRRrrRRrrRRrr".
Im not sure if she has a blocked nose because toto, never made this kind of sound....
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
Can’t play till 2moro but wyd like to know so I can make money hunting or robbingeverything and everyone
How much do pelts sell for online???
Alright y’all. I think I mis-tagged this earlier so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily w a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, & lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, **I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running** (I have no issue w being over 12+ ft from other ppl / usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually im quietly confident goin into these games but with injuries, players missing etc, im kinda happy if we get a draw.
I know they're utter pish and paper wise we should be wiping the floor with them but just not feelin the 2/3 nil vibe atm!
Anyone wanna talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
this is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait nvm shit meme.
i was 6 and playing lego rockband,
i decided to ask for the buddy holly pack.
my parents(despite being in theyre 40s) said "how the shit do you know that"
i never realised that my parents got into weezer.
so thats how i got into weezer
I genually don't understand how "toxic" behavior is more pusished than literally int or troll.
Well I've had an account which always recieved those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until i got in a bad streak of losses in ranked and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior.... And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in game chat for toxic behvaiour after a report doesn't understand the context.
I asked him if I should eat cereal or just wait till the morning but then I said nvm I just realized it’s almost 2
I’ll just wait
and then he asked what would happen if I ate it rn and I said nothing
it’s just too late

so inspiring but I just put my rubber bands in so it’s too officially late :(
Before I realized it was 2

I know your skin isn't perfect or you're insecure about your nose or looks.
but those flaws are what makes you different.
It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.
You're beautiful because you're YOU
Rant over

God. why did you give me this huge ass nose.
i'm too ugly to even rant on snapchat so i do it on reddit instead
ok it's over nowhopefully
Can I get a rip in the chat boys,
I was trying to go to sleep bc I couldn’t when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says bc she only said my name in all caps and then an nvm.
Fuck.
I just realized im complaining over a 5 minute fix..
Had never heard of this "influencer" before and consider myself pretty internet saavy.
I then lost interest in her bc her IG wasn't that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out and then I took a great interest in checking in on her bc I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while:
How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her $$ bc she claims to not being able to afford food or rent or whatever when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers which aren't cheap.
I don't like him or anything but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my bf with him.
I wouldn't do that to him ofc but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?

That's like ordering food at a restaurant and then saying "ahh nvm I want to eat somewhere else" as soon as they're bringing the food out.
I played a game as rengar and i was 6/2 and got solo killed by anvia who didnt have roa or tear finished yet
i looked over at the replay 100 times and all i can think to my self is if we both played the 1v1 perfectly which we both did the anvia will win cna
some one plz explain WHY THE FUCK AN ANIVIA IS STRONGER THEN A RENGAR IN A 1V1 WHEN THE RENGAR HAS A GOLD LEAD?
actual nvm dont care
just quting this brain dead game
I hit her fender in a parking lot, we checked the damage & both agreed to just let it be.
But after I drove off, she follows me for about 30 seconds & says "NVM" so I just gave her mines & went on with my day.

If there's a ghost in the house, why the HELL would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a lil too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they're screwed.
4. The f**k you splitting up for?!
There's always this one guy in horror movies that's like: Guys, there's a crazy a** killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed!
That's EXACTLY what the killer WANTS!
basically I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again cuz my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her) and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this reddit has been is "true_warrior is a bad person, oh nvm hes good" and "p90 is broken im quitting the game".
lol nvm I'm still here in can't sleep

Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise,what with having an storyline that doesn come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as Over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and neccesary amount of seriousness and comedy,
the characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert,Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events dont always have to rely on Neptune presence.
Gr8 b8, m8. I rel8, str8 appreci8, and congratul8.

ive taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take NO MORE.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: meh, ok, thats fine.
They then use shit like A sub 1 through A sub 20 for variables.
infact, i have a linear algebra book that did this... A's FOR EVERYTHING.
the pages were just matrices filled with A's.
JUST DRAW A WEIRD SHAPE OR SOMETHING- ANYTHING BUT THAT ISH!
Scariest thing 3ver m8
Well,well here we are again frustrated, angry in front of my phone
what a neat way to start isnt it?
All of ya readers are my theraphie and i dont ow you a cent

If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all cause of your short attention span so lets keep it short(what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying "keep it short im a genius ain't i?")
Well a tryed explaining to my budds that porn is kinda shaby and yeah just bad and u know who listened.......
Hey,I just want to know what games can I run on this PC and witch nota.
I was a spy and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, mafia and sk had made their kills.
I proudly said: "I was attacked while in jail!",
wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and ask me "You were attacked while you were in jail?" and I answer "yes m8".
He then tells me that what I am saying is bs because sk and maf have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously!?
Like I don't rly care what mean shit ppl on the internet say.
But when i got nobody IRL all I have is the internet and it do kinda hurt a bit when i just want to vent my problems.
And I'd be fine if it got maybe a single upv*te and no comments and I'd be fine.
But instead, it's full of people saying
Oh boi u 2 dum for da movie boi,
da director wuz like shieeet itz bout da hiden meaningz u have 2 find boi, lyke u kno it duznt spoonfeed ya da film ya kno?
Like shieet y it gotta explain m8,
just imagine what happened ya know?
It's no like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has ya kno?
yet when fully charged for the 1st 30-60 minutes, it's always on!
which is beaaaautiful!
Lastly, if i do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping) the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off?
wtf m8?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone? or is it just me?
in searching google i cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues i am really enjoying the mod.
its just a fuckin' ball ache every single time i want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before i can puff...
Everytime i log on i want to chill afk nmz and play xbox and be fat right but, lately i log on play rs afk for like 20secs and i get logged out and its fucking annoying
is it my Internet connection or is it the servers or what
its pissin me off m8
Next we have my Stats class and I didn't realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework and so my grade was a 70 something and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my Band class is basically easy A as it's show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert and so I passed that gg ez m8.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do NOT go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like "wtf m8?" and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there,
did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This years rookie game is actually going to be real exciting,

I don't like when ppl mumble on the phone or if they ramble on and it's all about then.
But now it just doesnt make sence, you only get 1 ticket per match and if you are lucky you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the 1 thing F2p was always abble to do because of the low cost of entrence and the rewards where good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.
You got a player extra and if you didnt like him. Use it as XP.
[Suggestion] if you dont like the new WT than dont play it.
Closed tech support?
It's 1:30am and you're a billion-dollar, global enterprise.

So long story short, I forgot to fill out the housing application for the fall 22 semester and i’m on the waitlist since April.

My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No. Fking. Competition.
Most men this day are thirsty af.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs.
And i mean that literally.
BUT – thats good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.
I (24) M an accountant at a traveling company
we ask our clients to pay their debts weekly, and today i called one of our agents and a girl picked up
she was their accountant and asked her if they will pay their debts and she said yes i will be at your company at 2100
i said ok, and at 2100 she came by and asked who is the accountant
i said i am please follow me to the room,
she came and i asked her how much did she bring
she said i have $1300 with me , which will not cover all of their debts btw, so i brought a reciept and write down the amount and the company name and the i asked her for her name

Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that,
she probably already have one also.
A real digital movie camera cost sooo damn much.
So I opted for an analogic one.
Now, 8mm/super have an affordable price, 16mm don't cost much, and 35mm cost A LOT so I think I'm going for a super 8.
But then how does it work?
Lol. I mean I buy her a super 8 but I should also buy her a videorecorder, and some VHS.. things like that,
Idk how it work.
Pls can someone explain to me what should I do

Hi guys, this year was my third year at glasto and I loved it sooo much and hope u guys did too !
Maybe a lil earlier idk cause I'm usually at work but my download speed is now stuck at the 64mbs range.
Now I understand at peak times it should drop, I even understand that since more ppl are at home I'm gonna see lower numbers, but to go from 500 to 60.
I am an aspiring doctor/med student and so seeing alot of med related subjects as early in our first sem I was so excited.
Then UPCA results came in, surprise!!
I passed for UPLB BS Bio!
Tbh thooo this wasn't my priority program, so ofc I had mixed emotions.
I was elated to finally be an iska but I was also worried bcos I'm not rlly as interested in Bio as invested I already was in PT.
Sure I could learn to love bio, sure I could transfer to UPM the next year but that's not certain.

We cannae dae that (not YET at least…)
You become the first minister tomorrow and you can do anything without repercussions.

So I will be starting a job next week and desperatly need to move down to the city its based out off, as a daily commute is impossible.
Looking for single bedroom flats or flatshares is a legit issue as 3 letting agents in the city own them all, and are only letting to students.
VACUUM WONT STOP SUCKING PLEASE SEND HELP, IS IT GONNA BLOW?
Basically if you didn’t know what that is,it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says "Lets eat granny" making it seem like someone’s gonna eat their nan.
However,the other example says "Lets eat,granny" implying a different meaning to the sentence.
Pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas ig.
I literally couldn't have been more at fault
just drove straight into this woman's golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it)
she seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it's my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers aswell just very minor body work/paint maybe a small dent.
what boardband do i get?
ive had virgin for 8 years and holy shit is it slow for 40£ monthly.

lol - small acknowledgement of a joke you sort of enjoyed but didn't actually laugh
LOL - adults and people who don't really know how the internet works use this
Lol - not sure why this came up but it's likely an autocorrect but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-lol is what it has been named
LoL - grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
also confusing because of league of legends.
looooooooool - now, i think my gf pronounces this but she says that this one would rhyme with "spool" but i think it's the drawn out "o".
So yeah, i think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn't exist.
lollllllllllllll - when i hear her say "loooool", this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it. but i still think that's "loooooool",
you can't repeatedly pronounce a consonant
So, when is big Ben going to bong again?

But the filters cost £15 a pop!
Can anyone reccomend one?
Prefferably under £50!
Also does anyone have tips on how to reduce dust in my house that are not energy consuming. (Don't require me to stand for legnths of time)
I have just bought tumble dryer balls to hopefully help reduce lint on my clothing.
It seems no matter what i do i literally can't keep the dust at bay for more than 24hrs and i am losing my mind.
It's 10pm, 28c, and my bum is literally melting.

To the neighbor that wejt out of their way just to check on me I appreciate that
I just wanted to say from one gen Z to millennials, good on you guys.
I hope you find what you're looking for. It's been fun being ur little buddies in life.
If anyone says anything remotely offensive on the internet everyone just has to say you can die or something.
Do we really care that much?
Not really tbh
Rmember, theres alot of fish in the sea!
As somebody that dosing experience alot of positive moments this sub does make me smile :)
Damn some ppl need to stop overreacting to stuff on the internet geez
I’ve come up with a list of all the questions I could think about (there’s kinda a lot lol), so I would reaaaaally appreciate it if someone would take the time to answer them.
If anyone is willing to PM me and chat about their test day experience and answer all my questions, that would be great too!
I’m gross and only brush in the morning.
I guess I see the need bc who the fuck cares.
But now it seems that y'all done made grits without the butter and made us madder than a wet hen, I must say!
We were fixin to tour more plantations than Carter's got little pills but you done gone and brought up them "slave owners" now.
Ain't amountin to nothin more than a hill of beans!

All this chicanery has got me worn slap out!
Y'all get along now, ya hear?
How to go from # to date?
How do I break of a relationship with my 'friend'?
basically I put my skate account in my Instagram bio cuz I have no posts on my main and I’m kinda insecure abt my body (in some of my clips I’m shirtless and ppl won’t expect me to be like shredded or sum shit if they add me) and today I got like 3 followers (girls from dif towns who don’t know me).
im really picky tho bc I don’t wanna have a relationship unless I actually feel like I’d really fuck w the person and be into them a lot so I didn’t follow any of them back.
bro ive gotten added and unadded on ig so many times today that it’s kinda a confidence boost lmao
Honestly, most of the posts or memes here are either from ppl who read the novels or the manga.
I have to dodge so many spoilers smh..
Nothing else to say, come at me salty ppl lmao

tldr: the title
Other vegans that youre friends w tell you that they dont tell other ppl theyre vegan?
Like the purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community cause those are probably the ppl that would be more gentle w their words, which is what some ppl need in order to listen.
Im a very straightforward, no sugar coating typa person, and although some ppl appreciate it, a lot more get upset & start trying to put words in my mouth &twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like 300€ worth of fake internet points, like wtf are you doing honestly LOL
Why would you give awards to ppl lol
i just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre googling and confirmed the time that ill be there at.
If she gives any further resistance I think ill just next her/ ignore/not respond / agree with her that she can't handle the place , or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first frikken date
Yes i agree things like tumblr made up identities are weird and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted calling ppl snowflakes is just weak
Give your self a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without ANY unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series! Props to you!
the New Year’s eve Raticate w hat.
haven’t found him anywhere yet.
anyone want to raid?
need a few ppl quick.
Stop.
I think what i am trying to say...this game is not hard.
Dont make it hard urself.
The main objective as i understood is to get the dragon. And dont die till that.
Even beter if u outfarm ur oponent.
Just dont die.
And trades in lane...if u see enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights but he was out of town
so we couldn’t do that- and now he’s back in town and I asked him what he’s doing on New Years and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers form our work
and likeeeee he didn’t offer an invite and then he said if he cancels with them would I like to come over and I just said idk what I’m doing yet so I don’t know
Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There’s gonna be ppl on the internet saying "stat padder" but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid

Just kind of realized that I’ve never had nye plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that ..
recently realized I still don’t have enough friends to have a one for my 21st coming up...
Idk why I didn’t clue into This tho.
Like I never thought about how ppl have traditions for this night, besides my sister who goes out to her friends every year.
It’s funny that covid isn’t affecting my Ny at all..
Anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight lol.
helo, im looking for ppl to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
just please be aware that im not very good at upholding conversations uwu f/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the "aaa" word, and I want to yank four words, *without* selecting the spaces after "ddd":> xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like i see vids on yt on it.
But like, i cant see any mention on the design notes etc.
Where do ppl get the info from?
Dm me to debate
pls be well learned in your belief.
I want dms bc Itll get deep and I cant reply to 300 ppl like that.
Also I need 500 characters so here come the blah blah
I m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl but I am saying that they wont like to do it bcoz they r humans with their own choices and not agreeing to be a girl isnt making them a women anti.
Like how many guys around you would be willing to turned into disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time [but how much time?]
and maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
but knowing this isn't making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they r asked to do all this.
I wont like it if you will try to make me a man and want me to dance in front of so many ppl eventhough I am a tomboy.
Anyone missing me?
If you miss a reddit friend, read this.
IT COULD BE pME!!
So I just hopped on PC from Ps4, not even 2.5k games played there,
played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a KB&M, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with ppl 2k kills and preds even,
yet I haven't even a hundred games played and about 80kills with all characters.
Not really having fun anymore,
can't improve if I get shit on every game
I see a lot of ppl on here who seem hella said, so if u hella sad I’m down to chat.
So yeah if u down for a chat, or long term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so
so i always see ppl talk about sending designs and edits to affinity but how do i do that??
ive worked at od for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it??
like not even the print sup.
we do every type of editing in store and i hate it.
like we’re out here doing stuff that im pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to affinity based on what i see on here.
but yeah is more of this info on the store portal or where can i learn more?
im extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last minute rude customers (:
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k and i was like-Hell Nawh That Not Worth 100k- like bruh- .-.
WhY dO pPl FiNd ThE NeW SeT ExPeNsIvE
Ik the girl I posted abt is a troll ppl- but oh well she got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down
It is the bar with the team comp and the status of each characters that is use to follow report team ( like in the actual world cup) .
It can be tweak down to not reveal to much info about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier and you won't have to use tab
HMU with a chat message,
tell me about yourself and we can go from there
I dont understand how ppl can build what they do...
i love building but i guess my creativity isnt well tuned as alotta ppls an it bothers me i cant build amazing stuff
i no i could if inhave the creative side uggh
i just tend to give up after awhile n settle for simple crap to pass for ok
I care abt how I effect ppl a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in convos w big groups of ppl which is related to adhd.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kinda stand offish to ppl idk.
I’ll try to act like idc if someone doesn’t like me but drunk ppl will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all r adhd things tho bc rsd
I’m a good listener. A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent
I can have a really really really flirty personality at times.
I remember in hs my friends mom said I had the "personality " so I’d probably be the r first to have a boyfriend
but when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds HER accountable she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects any / everyone who doesn’t agree w her and screams about how she doesn’t care
or more specifically in her words "I don’t give a fuck"
she’ll NEVER take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite
all the things she screams @ ppl to NOT do to her she turns around and does the exact same rude petty shit to any/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her
I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts JUST like my mom and my mom can’t stand it / accept that
so she becomes down right nasty.
In class I’ve usually been really quiet but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click w in class and be reallyyyy really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen b feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk thought.
I’ve always been a smiley happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have adhd.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk which I heard ppl w adhd are both.
Could I be istp ?
Help type me pls
Idk if ppl would even want to
just wanna know if thats allowed, and if not where would be a good place to post that
(ive watched dragonmar and other ppls videos but that would be hard to be a me specific video on there)
like in a good way tho
Some ppl are just indescribable
I ain’t done this before but i’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like interests :)
we can definitely talk abt anime (especially romance imma sucker for it), we can talk abt games and go into detail abt lore and shtuff, creepy stories go hard, and really i’m just down for anything :)
i’m not gonna be weird so as long as you’re not weird
any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah if i didn’t do this right lmk :)
oh and i’ll absolutely talk more on snap
The part I'm humming is like "word word word wo-o-o-ord" x2.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like "fly-y-y-yyy."
I'm pretty sure it's a popular song, I've heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah tbh it is
i care abt a lot of ppl and i cant just... make people be happy.
But like.... i wanna :(
Just wanna make everybody i care about happy,
like is that too much to ask
I think that some ppl here are ai or something
smh don't even try
i can do that by myself🤠
Hey, F/19 , bored af ,
I enjoy talking to new ppl,
hmu?!
i started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90s.
she said everyone was watching wrestling back then and it was a cool thing.
now no one gives a shit😭 (i don’t rlly blame them sometimes).
i asked her "why do u think ppl stopped liking it" and she said "cause it’s garbage.
it’s come on fox on fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hit i change the channel"
i had to include that in there bc she’s so funny😂😂😂
anyways.
Hey, Cant fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting,
hmu if u think we could hit off well,
hope we have a great time ,future chat buddy ;)😁
kinda weird ngl
These mfs can outrun, out swim or out stam (through venom) anything that tries to get it.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
just finished the show so i’m a lil behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much lol.
also by sidestory i mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
My favorite Obama quote: "Michael and I also wanna uh, acknowledge, uh.....yy...y.yy..uuuhhh..yyy....your son Jack, who deployed today."
New-ish player, couple of questions about parrying, etc
Having trouble with if / then / else / end in a repeat loop.
One of the best game ever that I play!
But have some probs..
I’d always heard of mac for years but never really checked him out in detail until a couple months ago and now he’s one of my favorite and most often listened to artists rn.
Anyways that was just my thoughts, Happy new years everyone hope the new year treats u well.
Now for this one it's kinda hard because the enemies are SOOO COOL for this game, but...
If I had to choose, I'd say I like the Clown the most.
I just think their design and movement is super neat.
Plus they are one of the few if not THE only enemie in the game that doesn't have a single other Variation from what I remember.
Honestly I wasn't gonna make one but I want to at least give my two cents especially since I dsagree with a lot of others list, not to say my list is right bc this is all subjective anyway which Is why I hate making them.
Here we go again, another character fighting tier list!YAYYYY
Imo lily for the most part is a rather likeable character (keep in mind ive only played a bit of season 1 up to like part of ep 3)unlike her father lily tries to work with lee and for the most part the group she does what she has to she is a bit of a bitch cause she has to i only have 1 problem with lily she killed carly
if you could get ben to confess yes i got spoiled on that and a few other things ben is useless he is what looks like a collage student yet he is useless and needs rescuing 24/7
pls dont downvote me into oblivion if i missed something
I pretty much just use it for drums and I like making complex beats so 4 isn't really cutting it anymore and piano roll editing drums kinda sucks IMO.
Is there a way to make the step sequencer into 8th or 16th notes in FL?
I’m not a trans man, but I am interested in knowing someone’s perspectives who lived both as a woman and as a man (not a lot of people get to experience what it is like to be perceived as both genders) so thats kinda neat imo
I don't think he did the role justice.
I feel before neo figured it out the way he was speaking was ok, but after...IMO he should of went full Hugo weaving speech.
Just wanted to share my opinion not being a united fan, on the game against burnley.
(not that many of you will care).
Mctominay sheeeeesh what a guy.
Thought that shaw was solid, now youve got two good left backs in good form.
Also wanted to say awb had a muhc better game i thought.
AFter the shitty games and dalot playing well I personaly thought awb improved alot.
Hahaha.
OMG it's terribl-....yyy funny!
I would be fine if it was changed to tome can ONLY drop at 4-6, yes this also ties into the item drop timing issues but for me I can live with those issues but not this, pls change
Kind of an odd question imo, but I have a bp who I just got to eat f/t for the first time (yay!!!), but she seems to prefer medium rats.
I've tried f/t large rats with no success.
First medium I offer and I got her to eat.
Could be a fluke though.
Ik it's like a meme or something of "dark souls player complains about the combat" or something similar, but I just don't get the combat.
I can do ds3 deathless, I know how to parry at about above average skill, I have played a shit ton of Ghost of Tsushima lately, ik not a difficult game but hear me out rq if you know the game.
OMG!
WHY do so many morons try to download PC game torrents when firstly they dont have ANY idea of how a torrent even works (its so damn easy though!) comments like "The link doesnt work" Rofl!
Yes, it works completely fine!
Your just way too dumb to know you need a torrent program.
😤Idiot morons 😡😡🤬
So i get tipped on the app, gave me cash at the door, then took away the tip on the app after?Wtf is even the point of that?
This shit has never happened before but now it’s happened 3 times this week.
Once the cash tip was LESS than the app tip...
If your are tipping both, TIP BOTH.
Ngl tft is a good mode ,but its like hs a good game to play on your phone not something to grind out all day all night like wtf ? Its not even that engaging (ideal game to turn on prep up and alt tab until its next time u can do anyhing)
any thoughts?
i know its a scientific things and all but some of the post there is just too much.
learning dream languages???
wtf?
and some bloke is saying "i tried the 3 jump and eat banana method but didnt lucid dream?!" every few hours.
maybe the post are just giving a litte too imaginative?
Like everyone is gathered and shows fake smile, fake dance, fake love and I am like Dear lord wtf is happening ooooh
So I am I first time cup user and i got the saalt cup at target.
I decided to do a dry run in the shower today and it went in pretty fine after a few different fold methods were attempted (C-fold+17yovirgin=ow) I got in in w/the 7 fold and it may not have been perfect but a great first try.
I go to take it out and how tf am i supposed to do this with my long ass acrylic nails.
In one way, it kind of helped me ~find~ the cup lowkey grip but god damn was it difficult trying not to stab myself.
I went grocery shopping I'm down to my last dollars soon and I can't just eat beer and cigarettes
then I set them down so I didn't have to carry them across the street to get beer (it's cheaper at Adventures First Stop)
then I walked back and forgot my groceries walked all the way home and ah shit, I'm getting shin splints from all this walking up and down the hill
I live on a hill.
down.
the middle, really.
i imagine it's like an amateur San Fran so I walked back and got them.
no crime round these parts.
not much, anyway.
Didn’t think about nails...
Is he gonna tell her?
If so how would that convo go down?!!!?
Okay wtf Arlo now knows sera ( idk how to spell her full name) is Johns weakness
First of all, we've seen they are greedy as f(OK, not as other mobile studios, but stiiiiiill) Second, game needs a lot of work to work well (even if it was designed for high end phones) Even that (oh, Allah may forgive me) damn Fornite mobile is better optimized nowadays.
Wtf are you yanks on
See also: (on an article about how it's "40 degrees in some parts of Europe") > wtf lol that's not hot at all put on a jakcet dummies ("[city] experiences average annual temperatures of 16C") > zomg thats rly cold im never moving to canada
Someines it will cause me to have racing thoughts, others it chills me tf out and gives me nods similar to codiene, why the hell is this?
I think it has something to do with wether or not a woman looks at me and thinks Im ugly, if that happens I get anxious From it, but ifva women looks at me and feels indifferent and even thinks im decent looking, I get good effects from the stuff.
WTF IS GOING ON
If you shoot an enemy then crouch to become invisble, even if they don't detect you they will waltz right over to exactly where you are.
Sneak is garbage in this game.
I shouldve just grabbed an smg and power armor.
I finally beat him after so many trys most of them being on his second phase, his 3rd phase I beat first time.
Only me guess its so broken?
I got 7 place on last event with Magaki but have 2960 points and get 50 frags instead 80 for 7-10 place.
Why?
Becuz i have less than 3000 points.
(i need 55 magaki frags and i get 50, just feel my suffering)
Also in other event with gamer764 i have \~8000 points and got 4 place and got rewards for 4 place, not for 1, whats need 7k points or more.
Are the developers too greedy?
Hope the title makes sense - Have a list of names "john.baker" (no spacing between names other than the period) and need it broken into 2 colums "john" and "baker" Thanks!!
I made plans to go camping during a day we were goin to see each other and I got a bunch of texts on how she wished I was still free Wednesday and so I canceled it and now she won't stop saying sorry that's not what she meant.
Wtf
do I do I told her I was going on another one next month(lie) to make her feel better but I didn't.
But, I don't neccesarily need top of the line if that also means the light will be heavy and bulky.
I prefer high speed, low drag equipment.
Would prefer to use AA batteries rather than being tethered to 16850s.
Can you recommend something?
Thanks
Okay so I've got less than a chapter left in GotM and I still can't understand wtf Oponn is trying to achieve through all their/its meddling.
Is there something I'm missing, is it continued in another book, or is it just a dead end?
It actually got like 7 updoots Yhall are whack
Wtf i posted a litteral anime foot and still didn't even make most controversial post of DAY. let alone all time
So huh you cant alpha karthus ult wtf is this bs?
It would be very helpful all of you OP's out there actually said wtf it was that everyone is talking about before going on a banter about it! Such as "now I understand why this (brand name) thing has everyone going crazy"...
To someone that is not constantly in the loop about the different changes, that doesn't mean much to me.
If it's too long to type, reference the original post, news article, video, whatever that the beginning of your post.
And the scary thing, I am not in the "DFW teams are cursed" camp or a #FireJD type.
However, some of this stuff is bugging me to much.
When Corey Perry being signed by the Stars is not the biggest potential WTF transaction among DFW teams, that is a bad sign.
I’m building a pc but in the mean time I use a crappy 13 year old pc I got money for rust bought it and it took 4 hours to download 1 hour to load and 5 hours to load a server after I hit a tree with my rock my game crashed at this time it was 12:47 am and I just said f**k it and went to bed ready for a hull lot of s**t today

GK pulls out one of the treasures from his backpack.

GT:

She left for another dude (a player), has strung me along this whole time pretty much and been hot n cold.
Now shes onto another guy as of the end of March and is currently on vacation with him for 9 days in another state
However, she takes the same bike trail as me (the only one) for the past few months and we run into each other every couple weeks and have small talk.
About a week and a half ago we talked for well over an hour on the trail.
Kind if disrespectful to the new bf huh?
We get along and she told me happy birthday on May 3rd, however, i will not be wishing her one today.
Birthdays are a big deal to her but i cant think of a reason why i should…
After going "uhh no?" She sends me a picture of said candle holder.
From her kitchen.
I of course go "wtf you're home??" and turns out she left an hour ago from the hospital.
No updates.
No phonecall.
So Im beyond pissed that I was even concerned for three days.
Tldr
:
sickly nmom went into hospital for 3 days, I find out shes home because of a candle holder.
ts been a few years and i dont care to look back so long as we can be happy together but
its really hard for her.
The thing that hurts her the most is i let her go through my phone after finding the nudes and there was a message i sent to someone on Facebook in response to her calling me beautiful bc of a song i made that i was sharing.
I was very flirtatious maybe more so than i was with my gf when i was first talking to her and that has been choing in my gfs mind.
Its been extremely difficult for her we have two dogs now i was hoping us having two pups to love would help draw her back to being in love with me again bc we have them to bond over but she still cant say “i love you too” she doesnt accept when i try to give her compliments bc ive said rude things in the past when i use to drink (2 years ago).
You can try fancy elaborate games but if you stink and dress like shit, best of luck to you but i dont see it happening.
Working as a waiter has definitely forced me to up my grooming by trumming my nails, wearing versace crystal noir and ither fragrances etc. Which i believe is the reason why most girls even if theyre taken at least are willing to have a convo with me.
Rejection is the ultimate tool for self development and even though ive been shot down by countless numbers of women in my life, i never let it get me down and i
m so proud of myself for even having the confidence to speak to these women even though i may not have hollywood good looks or charidma like will smith xD.
You guys are all beautiful and i wish you all the best of success with finding your companions :)
Shes 18 inches long & weighs 56 grams at 15 months.
Just curious if this is a pretty average growth rate for females or is she growing really fast?
She eats like an absolute champ every 4-5 days and shes already longer than some males get so I'm curious!
the anime is about an mc thats in a game but she doesnt realise it but the system says shes dead and etc i would like to wath the rest of it soo plz help me.
Lookking for a anime
Idk if to others its strange, but to me it was.
I got covid by kissing another guy for the first time, so i had to tell my mum.
I couldve just lied and say it was cuz of sharing cups or kissing a girl since in BI, but i knew my parents would be accepting... so i told them as it was.
My mum was VERY dissapointed because she thought she new me well, and though i told her everything but now she couldnt trust me anymore cuz bla bla bla... basically he was very dissapointed in me, and actually took time to convince her that i didnt feel like telling her because its private to me... till today she doesnt really trust me like before, but shes ok lol.
Today its my birthday so im sharing my ''strange'' comming out story
I am confusion??? whats going on lol.
This is my first time with sfu mail, after the sem I haven't touched anything school related until today heh, so idk how to fix this
So me and my friend started playing val again and want us to learn comms such as heaven and all of that, now I know what heaven is but I don't know others and if there is a website I would be happy to have to look at it :D
(If your still confused ill give a scenario "I hit the jett, shes in heaven" like the location.
Shes an awesome cook does all the grocery shopping.
My aunt and I will be helping out too, but shes not a good cook either LOL.
So I want to make their lives easier by meal prepping, and to make sure my mom is eating wellshe cant be eating junk recovering!
(I got this a lot where a girl gets hired and I have to help them, they are always rude to me for no reason, unless the woman is older or its a guy)She
's all nice and sweet to everyone else but she's just rude to me.
She will take credit from me and blame me when stuff goes wrong(not to my face).
The moment she is around guys and other people, she belittles me.
She talks good about herself, takes my credit then blames me when something goes wrong and everyone in my department goes along with it.
Which is wrong, when she is there she doesn't do any work and clowns around with the guys but only when the managers aren't there.
The worst part about it is people really like her and think me and her are close friends.
The "false advertising" on thr A4 passive is very easy to understand if you just read the whole skill were it says multiple buffs cant co exist.
Maybe im the only one but i think this is all dumb and alsp kills a lot of peoples excitement.
I dont like to hear people freaking out for no reason over a five star lol.
Its just like zhongli.
He was fine but everyone freaked because he wasnt doing enough to dumster content and was balanced.
Ive seen lots of ppl in the fandom make rude/racist comments about liberty and its disgusting please leave her alone.
And you do realize shes black?
stop making fun of the actors ethnic features its honestly rude and not cute.
There is nothing wrong with her lips or having big lips in general its not even funny honestly its just sick and not cool to behave like that.
And its not even just liberty I've seen people talk about Sav and also Jimmys hair.
(also mods please dont take this down I really want people to see it and I have done nothing wrong I've been having some of my post randomly deleted for no reason)
( As simple as removing the salad and remaking it without guac.)
She then told me we gave her less meat when I brought back THE SAME PLATE sans guac.
SHES HOME FOR THE FIRST TIMEE
SHESS FINNALLY BACKK
I am making this because of one reason only.
I have to keep my pup im her crate at night bc if i dont she will poop on the floor.
So theres already 6-8 hours of her being inactive.
Then i have work - which is again 6-8 hours.
I have to keep my corgi in my bathroom at this time because if i dont she will reek havoc unsupervised.
AITA for starting a fight with an old friend (Strong Swearing)
Even better for me it would be: It would be an unbeleafable loss to let a broken an thus spilt bottle be wasted with no return.
So to show my sincerest appologies for bumping staight into a nobel that half marched in his drunken stupor, down the sidewalk, straight out of a likor store and making him drop his bottle worth more than what I suppose one of the merchants off the mainsteet makes in a month, I was offerd to finish the wasted goods, less they spoil any further.###-!-###”Y-y-yyy-yes sire!
May the heavens cry before your mercyfull heart!"
"Now get lost!
This is no place for desease ridden vermin like you." "O-off course my lord!" I ran.
Back down the alley I squirmed my way out of.
Filled to the brim with anger and shame.
Sidestreets and alleyways, down I went.
Further and furhter out of sight.
So me and my crush were on a group chat on snapchat with my friend, me and my friend were arguing as a "joke" and then she said she prefered older guys, and my friend was (M14) and i said im a year older than you, and she says "what i mean by older guys i mean age 17" and it hurt my heart.
TLDR; my crush says she prefers dudes who are 17 years old and im 16 and shes 15 and it broke me down.
Hello I am new on here but idk if I am the butthole or entitled one this story, this is short but I was expecting to get a tat for my 18 bday like any 18 year old but I wanted to go to this one shop that my brother goes to I dm the artist I wanted but nothing for 2 months like yea I understand they booked for summer tats but at least say "hey I am booked for the rest of ____" but I was like ok will I am gonna look at another artist work from this shop that does small tats same thing happens no answer
so
me and my brother decides "ok let's go to the shop and ask then we well at least get a answer"
we go and this young girl attends us lets call her (brenda) I told her everything, brenda said "well u can do the tat with me"
I said "I'll be back i'll think about it"
I got back in the car and scroll through her work it was good work so I went back and told her yea let's do this I signed everything she didn't even ask for ID which I found weird bc I gotten my piercings done by the same shop and they needed to have ID on records and so on I brushed it off since shes new and all she worked on me for a hour told me all the necessary tattoo care stuff and said after 3 or 4 weeks to let her know if there need to be fixes and that it was on her I was like ok great thanks, 4 weeks passed and there was alot of mistakes made bc I got a small tat heartbeat with a ";" in the middle but the period on top was a small heart the right side of the heart was smaller then the other side and some of the lines were thick to thin then broke to thick again
So I reset it and yeah oops was doing it wrong all this time.
Did anyone else kick it away and get mad it wasn't dying?
Then afterwards she began to text very dry ? and like through text she kinda sounded mad.
I texted her in the night yesterday asking if shes mad and like she said shes only abit let down ?
I was really confused afterwards as she began to drag text me and like i apologized to her and she said its alright .
Then i just told her im going to sleep and she just left my message on delivered and like she didnt reply to today.
How to tell whether she's mad at me or just annoyed cuz rn im really confused
WIBTA if I was just be a bigger sarcastic Asshole to another Asshole?
Her tumors are behinning to open through her skin, she wont jump, pain killers dont help, she ate a lot yesterday but wont eat or drink today, she hid most the day but..... Its hard because shes alert.
It feels wrong because she looks at me like "i love you.
Im happy your here with me" but the vet said she wasnt even supposed to live this long and the tumors will only get worse and even if we had done chemo, it would have only prolonged it.
friend told my girlfriend something, she then broke up with me, i dont know what to now because she and the ex friend where the only people that i had.
what should i do to try and regain my relationship because shes helped me through alot over our 2 years of dating
TLDR
gf broke up with me bc something someone said and i want to regain relationship with my gf
He waited for me to leave to fire someone who has been a dedicated employee bc shes a poc with tattoos and”fits the part” of someone he considered would be on drugs.
It makes me sick.
I reported all this high up bc I need to protect my staff but I’m worried that this will turn around and bite me.
My ex looooves kids.
She was playing captain save a hoe, almost caught a domestic case over this woman's situation with this girl's "crazy" baby daddy.
They moved fast.
They were in eachothers life.
it hasn't even been two months!!!
IM SO HURT.
SHE NEVER WANTED TO BUILD A LIFE WITH ME.
I KNEWWWWW she would be all in if I had a kid on me.
He, soon as he saw That I was weeping, answer'd, "Come with me."
Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd.
Ent'ring he led me with him on the bounds Of a great circle itself encirclign a great abyss.
Ere, I beheld an uneven land with lava pyramids cover'd, With sickly farms of melons and carrots, near barren of life Save for those imprison'd in it, who, though they surrounded Us, dar'd not approach for fear of master.
As mine ear could note, the sound was heard of screams, Cries, and explosions that made th' eternal air Tremble, caus'd by slaughter, starvation, withering, and Grief felt by those multitudes, many and vast, Of men, women, and children.
Theyve grown out to the point they look kinda awkward and shes saying i should get them filled, but would it be weird or bad (like for my nails) or anything to ask about getting them completely redone with something Id like better?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SHE SAID SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME CLOTHES THAT FIT ME IM DYINGGGG SHES SO SUPPORTIVE AND NICEE OMGGG
So its 0:34 the first of January while posting this and my Sister (f14) just Ruined my New Year by Calling my Mum Fat and telling her shes a drinker when she Poured herself a glass of champagne, wich she only does on her Birthday on chrismas eve and on New year.
Now my Parents are pissed of, my grandparents are pissed off and my Sister thinks she was Funny.
The same thing happend on Chrismas eve and now the whole feeling of new year is gone and i hate my sister.
P.S. English is my second language so sry for spelling
Screw INTJ’s.
Why they gotta be good at EVERYTHING?!
It was a MISTAKE getting the booster the day before new years.
I feel like absolute dog water.
literally most of today we spent cuddling and talking about random shit and i almost cried🙏 im so happy bro.
shes so cool.
im gonna ask her to be my girlfriend at midnight :)
also, happy nye/happy ny everyone!!
first of all, the satisfaction i get from saying i am the manager when customers ask for one is amazing.
a high i’ll never come off of.
second of all, customer comes in for the second time mad because i didnt do copies from a book because of copyright.
she goes “well i called customer service and they said you were not supposed to reject me like that”.
and im like ?? ma’am its in our policy idc what customer service says.
she keeps on being rude and yapping then throws the book on the counter and goes “make my copy” like lol not when you act rude like that.
our cat is getting fixed on the 11th, and shes such a cuddly, loving, little girl and i love her cuddles every night and in the morning im just scared that she isnt gonna be like that after she gets fixed?
am i over thinking it?
do you think since shes in the habit now and loves cuddles and such she'll do it all her life?
Me and my partner have this running joke that I domt fart.
It started out as a joke after I told her that as an answer to a truth or dare question on our first date.
Recently shes been asking me if i'll fart infront of her.
She says her friends have all heard their partners fart and its weirf shes never heard me do it.
I can't believe she saying im depressed looking while shes so shy girl and weird thinking she's not,so delusional i hate it,but they are mine only friends,she calling me cringe without a reason...
I recently returned to d2 after several year, now I’m windering: Where do you guys sell/buy your stuff?
Do you just make a game “O xxx N yyy” and hope for the best?
Or are there a website that’s more efficient?
Mine friends are mean and delusional,one is immiture and shy and always pulling me down,other is fine just jealous and its getting on my nerves,what to do?
This is a set up I can live with.
My bf and my's fear however is in a few years when we're ready to settle down, Gina will be wanting to move in and be long term with her own bf.
I'm very stuck.
I love my boyfriend and desperately want to keep his system happy.
But I am not going to allow anymore pushing of the boundries.
What do I do here?
Boundry Issues w/ my boyfriends alter
She was super keen for a second date and we arranged a location but not a date, due to the Christmas holidays.
I appreciate it’s a busy period for people, so our responses were like 1 per day.
She was upfront when we met and said shes sh** at texting, and has apologies when we were speaking for slow replies, something which I said don’t worry, I know your busy!
Convo seems to flow well, lots of questions from her side in the conversation, however I’ve not received a response for 3 days (unread)
but
she’s viewed my story & posted a story since, it was NYE.
So i was all ready for the new year actually thinking positive and the changes im going to make etc then i see hes posted a picture of them both that shes took saying 'love of my life'.
It destroyed me.
He also put a status about 2022 being a special one.
Talk about rubbing it in my face
Exes bf posted a pic of them :(
Everytime i ask other people for advice on this situation, they all tell me that she’s probably insecure and looks up to me (even tho shes older wtf) and that i shouldn’t blame her for the way she feels.
I cannot deal with her, she drains the life out of me, I cannot talk about anything without her either trying to copy me or compete with me.
Recently ive been losing weight, and our family members noticed and commented on it.
In the corner of my eye, i could see her getting uncomfortable and then obviously she brang herself up and started talking about her accomplishments.
We agree to seperate as our marriage was hitting a nose dive in general.
2 months later we get back together.
We do intensive therapy and things seem to be great im sooooo happy.
On our anniversary month wat do i see on his phone snapchat.
I look on it again i see jane but this time i can look at there conversation history throughout this whole year and last.
So i just got my first beardie.
Hes only a moth old and like most new owners im worried about if hes or she is not eating enough.
I try to feed him in periods throughout the day but so far ive only been able to feed about 6-7 crickets .
Ive tried feeding him some vegies too but the guy doesnt show any interest in them.
Is there anything Im doing wrong or is he just fine and im overly worried.
Then I foundout about this really cool website called Complex
.
Theyre sort of like journalism but better since theyre all about hip hop.
I found out about Travis Scott through complex.
before I listened to trash artists with no aesthetic but travis scott made me realize that aesthetic is really important.
now i like tame impala and ive started dressing weirder, i bought my first pair of joggers last week and hopefully ill wear them soon.
Who is a former (or still) important person in your country, that constantly compromitise himself/herself on social media?
is it just me cringing at the twitter posts by albatross?
everyone who knows who he is knows his stance.
hes making it seem like xvg is a sinking ship atm and its doing fine.
soo i have this friend IRL.
man the dude is known everywhere.
hes got a solid rep in the streets, in the jails, everywhere this guy goes everyone knows him.
he was trying to explain to me how to get more karma on reddit because i feel like i'm not really known.
how do you get hella karma?
Im 21 hes about to be 23, my issue is that he seens to have no ambition anymore, he doesnt work and doesnt make an effort to finish school, even small trade schools for a certification as an emt, he failed it the first time by 2 points and I think he fears failure that he doesnt really want to try anything anymore.
Hes been unemployed for over a year now and failed that school almost a year ago.
Ive gotten super smough about 5 times but i always get stuck in his nuclear butt bomb aura.
I swear im far enough away but it still shocks me in 1 hit.
Im using 2H battle axe +10 gargoyle helm and naked (even with tattered armor it doesnt seem to make a difference) Chloranthy ring and ring of steel protection.
Any tips?
I know throwing myself at them enough times ill get them but its slowly wearing at my sanity.
I know what to do but i seem to always get caught in a dumb combo or something.
I bet you didn’t bother reading the whole number, or noticed the letter I put in there, annnd now you’ll go back to check only to realize there was no letter.
What I if also told you, you read this sentence wrong too?
*WELL NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION* I hope you’ll carefully read through the rest of this post :^)
19/F Aww shit, here we go again for the 7754378435116th time
If I just wana make draven my 1 carry how should i do it.
I know hes a good unit but what items can turn him into a god.
I tried heali g sword n rfc but i get lost after that.
Atlus is a great character however his shield is gun is op and his rewind ability is somewhat annoying.
However the most annoying thing is his shield.
If you place down the shield and just use it to stop bullets thats fine.
However
I was playing as Skye today and threw my ult at his shield.
It did not activate because it got absorbed.
Idk about other players oppinions but I believe that Atlus should be nerfed a good bit so hes not op evough to counter everything.
Tell me what you ppl think
I didn't think anything of it so when I went to give the last cookies on the shelf to him the EK started screaming "MOOOOOMMYYYYYY HE STOOOOLE MY COOOOOOKIES!!!"
At first I was startled i started to get nervous and i froze.
Then EP walks up and starts yelling "GIVE THOSE COOKIES FROM MY DAUGHTER GIVE THEM BACK!!"
And I did not know what to say at first but then something came so mind just say " but I didnt."
But the way I said was so cautious.
Then my sister takes the cookies from my hands and handed them to my dad.
That's when my dad noticed (hes old sad he didn't realise a little bit ealier) he called a manager to the seen and the manager told us to continue and he'll deal with it.
Basically the title.
We're both xxx majors (I'm a dual xxx and yyy major while she's a xxx major and yyy minor, so we are taking 2-3 classes together every semester until graduation in May 2018).
While I wouldn't say I'm smarter than her, things tend to come more naturally to me, and I'm a good test-taker, while she has a lot of test anxiety (will often get questions wrong that me and her practice right before the exam, will freak out about not having a formula that was on the formula sheet, etc.), but she easily studies more than I do.
Its not until my next billing cycle i notice somtjing was off.
I was a bit lower then normal and i keep a vary close eye on my expences.
I looked over my bank stanments and there is was.
My NEW prim bill.
I was super confued and got ahold of amazons custmer suport.
They helped me as much as they could, but becuase i was receiving my servese through the phone company i would have to go though them and fiugher out the problem.
The next day i had off i walked in and talked to a vary sweet girl who tried to understand what my problem was.
We kinda talked in a circle for a bit as i tried to explain what the amazon costmer service told me.
We looked me up in there system and there i was 2 lines but no prime membership for either one of us.
She could see the date i opened my first line and then the 2ed.
Both dated added up to what i had told her before.
She stared at the compurter screan for awhile with a confused look on her face.
We broke up 2 months ago.
We had very little contact.
But tmrw im no longer putting up with it.
He would be the one to reach put all the time.
I never reached out first.
And if I answered it was only about the class he was paying me to do.
He is still on my car insurance and he messaged me on friend asking what was going on with it.
I answered the next day and said i didnt change anything.
After that part of the convo ended i asked him how he was doing about the death of his dog.
(He is deployed and his dog was his world)
he said that hes good when he doesnt think about it and how he told his mom to cremate him etc.
Day 1 of no contant starts tmrw.
Help.
So me and a friend ended up making a poster we used my name and ill credit his Instagram below hes a good guy im glad we got both our ideas in the poster for the game and or story would you guys like either home made lore or not?
i could=t post this on the fallout Reddit for some reason, wouldn't let me put the photo hope its good guys!
is it even possible for itsoktocry to blow up outside of the 3 songs hes had do extremly well? Like get burst into the mainstream rather than just have a few albums do well then fall off?
Me and my friend have been playing Minecraft together for awhile and they made their own server so we can play on it together alone, cool.
I have always told my friend how much i despises griefers because they dont just destroy something in a game they destroy HOURS of work and it fucking sucks.
My friend lately has been really mean to me when we are playing, constantly saying im mean if i dont go half way across the map to give him material that can be easily obtained where he is, literally repeating to me non stop how im 'mean' or a 'bad person' because im busy doing something so i cant go give him his shit.
Well I finally get a chance to let loose and have a wine date with a childhood friend of mine that I dont see often at all.
We drink (at my house) while the kids are playing and such.
Nothing heavy,we do get slightly tipsy ya know.
Towards the end, my husband sends me a fb message saying hes ready for her to leave (she'd been there 2 hrs at this point) and then he starts passive aggressive cleaning in front of us.
Hes going through a divorce so he keeps telling me thats taking all his money.
I didnt give him a title as I didnt even get one when i bought it.
It was salvage from some guys as a used car lot.
They gave me a bill of sale but I've long since lost it.
Should take him to court or do y'all think its not worth it?
Also if I did want to how would i?
So I just told this guy in my class who was also weird af and gave it to him saying oof I sat on jt it broke do u just want it.
Hes like no ew.
I have ocd and immediately got ashamed and was like lol whys it gross it's the same as a whole one and along that line like lol why and he was like ok oof it's not and I'm like lol why did you say that.
I was saying it jokingly but I'm afraid I looked weird like wtf whys she upset or playfully upset that I dont want it.
My hooman staff cooms home tastin of sos ages and cheez.
I think she has anovver fluff she is makin treets for.
Shud I bee sad or anger?
Wat duz yur hooman taste of wen they coom home?

anyways, these terrible memories kept haunting me, so yesterday i finally mustered up the courage to message him.
me: hey how's everything
him: it's been time
me: sorry abt last year, i was super awkward around you lol
him: lol nah dwai
*

him: haha you could've just told me!
next time you see me just say hi.
do you still go to (school)?
I'm not like r/Nicegirls but that reply didn't sit well with me.
Hey gyz just wanted to share this helpful app with you all :D .
Its not tht i am trying to promote this app or something, it really helped me a lot thts why thought it might evn help u gyz out .
I 've seen quite a lot of people struggling to increase their team ovr's and many are thinking to buy players but cant decide which will boost their team ovr's the most .
This app helps to calculate the ovr of ur team after filling all the players in their respective positions.
It is really tough for most people(f2p players) to keep on buying and selling players to decide our team ovr since it will result in a huge loss of coins(coz of 10% EA tax).
Whats the wecommended amount of wedicated wam i shud have to servur?
IF u r readin this, u shud b ashamed ov yurself, u shud b sleep,go 2 bed i say

Just small info, I'm 5'9 140lbs male.
Currently, my 5k is 1:58.7 and my 2k is a 1:51.1
My coach says I should be 1:49 for a 2k but I really can't hold a 1:49 for more than 1200 meters before my split just rises to 2:05-2:10.
Is 1:49 just my coach being a typical "u shud be good but ur not so im gunna giveu unrealistIC GOals", or should i be at 1:49?

Arent u all tired of seeing atleast the first two jumping into battle and wiping out ur whole team in an instant?
I’ve heard somewhere about people saying if they werent here then well the game would be balanced, well i beg to differ cos theres akai with his insane disruption and diggie with his timely ulti or maybe even irithel might be banned cos of her deadly ability to snowball and splash ult.
Back to the topic.
Honestly the king and queen of this game is lancelot and his beloved fanny.
Yoo know, to keep it safe from me in little car where I can go anywhere.
And then Mom-O desidez to go to gym to do kwik workout, whatever dat iz.
She sez to me, "Yoo leave steak alone, doggo.
Yoo be gud gurl!"
She tied plastik bag reel tite around steak.
Hahahaha!
Then she goes into gym and when she comez bak many furevers later, GUESS WHAT??
Hahahaha!
She open tiny car and look at me and look at steak bag....and she say, "GUD GURL!!! Yoo leeve steak alone!"
And dat is da storee of me bein' gud gurl.
Mom-O sez she shud have brought steak into gym and left on bench next to her wiff her sweatshirt.
Sez she dum not to think of dat.
Mebbe Mom-O will git smart in a few furevers.
Now I obviously can't get out and shut it on the main road so I pull down a few side streets and ensure that no one fucking knows I've quickly jumped out and shut it.

Or maybe i am just wierd lol

Aita , me (31f) asked my kids dad (43m)to help me finish off stripping wallpaper in kids room so I can finish decorating it.
I recently had surgery and am not ment to lift too much or stretch but felt OK n thought I could do it alone .
I can't, I hurt my incisions so asked him to help do the top of walls were I can't reach .
He said yes n today came to do it , after a bit said he was done and leaving, I gave him £20 n said how greatful I am for the help .
Checked room once he left ...
both kids beds full of torn off we wallpaper , draws cracked where he stood on , iv still 2 walls left unfinished and have spent last 45 min picking up wallpaper from everything.
His kids sleep on these beds , aita if I confront him about the mess or shud I let it go n not bother asking in future
my boyfriend gets impatient easily and gets annoyed when i ask dumb questions (example, i didnt know how to fill my tire and he got annoyed after he explained it once and then said “why is it hard….. just fill it” so i tried to do it but i failed.
later he was like “babe… it took you an hour to fill your tire?” then when i do it myself and dont ask him he goes “why dont you ask me, i can teach you/help you” but i refrain from asking becuz he gets frustrated
The last couple calls had arguments as he got mad cuz I beat his ass in video games (even tho gaming is his only hobby) and I’ve left wondering if our relationship is worth the trouble.
I’ve talked abt him to lots of my irl friends and they all ask why I continue to be his friend and I can never confidently answer why.
But he’s depressed and lonely and wants my attention as I’m one of the only ppl who actively tries to interact w him online.
yeah Ik shoes don't match.
they match the graffiti tho !
I'm trying alot of different styles so lmk what I shud change

I don't remember specifically which, I think both bugs do it, but here in Florida there's a particular bug that makes a loud sound 100× longer than when it's not making a sound.
I'd describe it as that trademark dessert ambiance sound.
She had me live with a woman once named Chi who said similar stuff , and … it’s just dude wt…
heck it’s weird , so maybe it’s BOTH sort of a paradox (life is) but I just wanna know Hinestly did anyone else feel it ?
I want a logical explanation Plz , n if one don’t exist well I mean cuz loooong before … I was “of age” so to speak … for lack of more efficient words that would be appropriate cuz I don’t drink but I’ve … hmm I’m an adult let’s put it like that there’s other stjfff out there but Long before thag me and my Family saw a UFO even mg step dad said he couldn’t think of what else it could’ve been and me and my friends saw this white hooded thing in a park about 10 feet tall n like … it doesn’t really scare me cuz I think it’s the way life is things change they don’t always have to make sense , and others say that

I reside in Hyderabad,India, currently pursuing my bachelors in computer science .
I am a candian citizen but,for enrollment it is required to appear for the IELTS exam .
Now,the doubt that has arose is...wud my admission be considered international or domestic?..
On a side note,how hard is it to be admitted to UoT's computer science program.
What would a typical admitted applicant have to get admitted?
Wud preffer a hardcore clan with a plan.
With a strict mentality of how certain things would go down.
I mean a clan that always has a goal / target, that also enjoy teamplay.

Hi, I was wondering wheter or not it worths to drop some money on pets.
Like I saw how much some ppl can spend on them to get good results (like t4), and I wouldnt want to spend that much :D.
Currently I have 5 t1 pets, and I wouldnt mind to see some increase in their looting speed, but I wonder if dropping "just" 100$ would worth it.
Does it worth to drop 100$ on pets?
towards the end of senior year and tht summer idk what happened but i got a hot bod n my face was all "girl u been through some shit have a gift" so now im pretty?
I jus made a post on a diff sub about having a nice date today, which is nice, but i am vv hesitant on making frens n stuff cuz of the last two years.
so like, after my glow up or whatever more ppl started talkin to me ya?
n a lot of boys did too!
i never rlly had v many frens so this was a huge yay!
the first boy i hung out with was rlly nice but then we got high and i did vv regrettable things i do not like.
Well tht boy was super haps n told lots of boys.
I dont want to jinx it and call them out by name but im talking with a company and im hoping it works out!
I
m excited about all things ill be able to do with these free promo products to help other ppl and possibly get them off some or all of their rx drugs!
I
m excited for myself because i have a bunch of medical issues that i do not use rx drugs for and the other stuff i buy is expensive.
This sponsorship will help me, it will help me help others and it will help this company as well.
Im ready, im ready!
Im hella excited!
Might be picking up a new sponsor!
What to do - plants now waaay small for its age imo and started to grow pistils- should I chop n restart or ???
Will be posting more here once I get...comfortable again.
(Self love is impt!)
I’m on and off though, and have quite a bit of messages to go through ~ will get to them when I can :3
In the meantime, happy new year!!
ps:
I don’t have a SC & don’t take any $$$, I just like to.. show off, y’know closet slut things :) lol
Ttyl y’all
He said "shhh just kis me you fool".
I still love him and I cried so much on valentine's weekend (dont judge lmao) , but I said "No.
You're f***ed up now.
Whats going on?"
He never replied to me afterwards, and this interaction took about 10 minutes through text.
Today he says "good lord wtf happened.
I gotta garden ttyl".
He read my reply which said "I'm so worried about you!
Why would you take that?
Where did you find it and why would you take it?
Eat and stay hydrated".
I just don't know anymore.
I suspected it, but I want him to be upfront about it with me.
I love him and he will always be my first and I'll always talk to him and care for him, but I don't want to be held in limbo.
I'm trying to move on and this is now in my head.
I know when ever I say ttyl or gn or whatever I wanna add an ily.
Just casually.
To see what happens.
I know that every time I get a text from them I get super excited.
I know when I am having a bad day just thinking of them makes me feel so much better.
Just knowing I can go home and text them brightens my mood ten fold.
I know sometimes I day dream about just holding them and being near them.
But what I don’t know is what this means.
I’ve known them nearly four months now.
That’s not long.
Makes me feel like this is an infatuation that will pass.
Tbh I kinda hope it is bc I don’t think it’s mutual.
But oof is it hitting me hard.
Is it merely infatuation?
Their explanation is that they’re a bad texter, or busy, but honestly so am I(will takes days or a week to respond) but I don’t leave people on read or open messages I know I can’t respond to atm.
It really isn’t that hard to send a quick ttyl either tbh.
Finally they seem to want to engage w/ me and basically tell me they’re going to an event and they’d hope to see me there, which they reaffirm the next day and then day of.
I go to event, they never show.
At this point I’m too stressed from a lot of other shit I got going on and it’s not like we’re really talking so I just block them.
Idk, I need to change my mindset or this and that for my benefit and survival, I'm still "Ocean Serene” but maybe I'm .. idk that's a tough thing to say, I never thought that my gf was just a random, I love her to death, she is my boo and will always be it.
Just like I said allot of things, I'm gonna agree that if I change the world changes, the advice you get, it's allways iffy, I want to speak for everyone but at the same time I can only speak for myself, also I went to get some rum and coke, I got coke and a few other people seen it so they bought some coke..
erm, I hope my friends are ok (that's all you weirdos I'm talking about) random story I know, tbh I'm not ok, but I'm surviving like usual, actually I'm all just a bit Right and fine.
Ttyl
[bro] Across the country?
She acts like 500 miles is a long way.
[me] lol, its 8 hrs to [redacted].
7 to [redacted].
not a big deal
[bro] I suppose when you don’t maintain your vehicles an hour drive could be detrimental.
[me] lol
[me] i spose [redacted] or [redacted]'s wife ratted me out.
maybe i should block them too
[bro] Sorry for her awkward messages.
I was in the middle of a drunk nap when she pulled up to my house and I told her you jumped ship.
Told her not to try to contact you and we can see how well that went.
[me] shiiiiiiiiit.
betrayal
[bro] I’m sure she’s contacting you for her own self gratification.
I was in a toxic rs for 4 months.
During our dating period and a month or so into our rs we were great.
One day both of us were jealous of each other for no reason.
Im going to admit that sometimes when i feel jealous i just want her to reassure me like how i reassure her that its all good but she will only reassure me once and then said bye or ttyl.
Most of the time in an argument its always my fault, she wont admit to anything or say sorry.
I will always be the one to give in so that the fight wont continue anymore
And I said “But yeah yeah you right.”
And he said “Ye well I gtg.
Im doing something” and I was gonna type aight ttyl but I realized we ain’t at that level anymore.
I didn’t like that.
The vibe was going good.
I didn’t have a bad vibe.
When the convo started.
But once he said he’s doing something my heart dropped.
Like what was he doing?
He’s never done this before.
This was such a different person.
I hate it.
What can I do?
All these attempts I made were basically shut down.
I like him but I’m not trying to flirt or do anything!
I know he doenst like me like that.
We talked about it.
Right now I’m just chatting with him.
But he doesn’t seem like he...wants to do that.
If he doenst want to talk to me he can just fucking tell me.
Idk what else to put Besides that i hate the current circumstance of life i live in im gonna give a little insight tomorrow Ok i lied i have to reveal my age tomorrow because if i dont Itll mess up the story Um Idk what to type so ill type a worry i have Umm i dont think ill get the tapegun intime Ok bye ttyl everyone
she said something like "but i want to make sure that we go as a friend?" thing and i was like "okay, i know" and sometimes she talks about her relationship and she said "ofc i like my long time bf" yea, whatever right haha and here's my question... yesterday when i was at work, she msg me saying something like "how's your work doing" and i kinda reply her with cold tone saying "i'm at work ttyl" and then she kinda upset : "
Okay, i mean i understand you are at work so busy but u didn’t cut me off like this before so i kinda get it that you dont want to talk anymore like before.
got it!
bye!
How do you get destiny delicacies I've seen a few ppl have them but I've never got one idek where you get them if anyone knows it would be alot of help☺
and my machine f!@#ing freezes up it's been happening for like 2 days now... this machine can run a goddamn $26,000 3d scanner but 4 browser tabs on reddit and new a chat session uses up 87% OF MY DAMN MEMORY AND 60% of my cpu power and freezes the wholedamn thing up.
HEY! WAIT!
i've got a new complaint! ..... Seriously WTF are you devs doing???
stahp plz
If you think it's rude to just walk away in the middle of a conversation without excusing yourself, or at least saying "gotta go I'll talk to you later" then it's also rude when texting.
I could let it go if it was a one off, things happen, maybe something came up and you got distracted etc.
But EVERY SINGLE PERSON ghosts in the middle of a conversation.
It's really not that hard to just say "gotta go, i'll text you later" or "so and so just got home, TTYL" Even just "bye" or "BRB" or something!
Today i got mad and just flat out asked him to tell me where the problem was and if i did something wrong.
He said he was with his friends and he didn't wanna ignore them just to talk to me, i said it wouldn't be a problem if he had just said something like "i can't talk rn" or "im with my friends ttyl" or just literally anything.
He then said i was overthink stuf and i should " chill out" so i left it at that.
So AITA and over thinking things?
AITA for gerring mad at my bf after he ignored me for a few days
So I would usually post this on r/keto but that sub is soooooo intense about their keto.
And I respect it.
But like, a girl’s gotta rant.
I started keto a few weeks ago.
Have been doing well, and I feel like I’ve lost weight.
Out of nowhere I get slammed with cravings.
My body is like “bitch, CALORIES PUHLEAZE”
I oh so badly want to make it to my goal weight and flock around on a beach in a bathing suit, and I also want to honor the tenacity that r/keto so proudly espouses in their no cheat days mantra.
But, alas, another side of me wants to curl up in my bed with my favorite gluten free dairy free carb dense carrot cake and go to satiety land.
Afaik, the concept of mini album is only around in kpop (maybe jpop?) I
m always dissapointed when a long awaited comeback or something is only some 4 or 5 songs album.
I can tolerate debut album since you really dont have a lot of material, but if youre snsd or something and you come out with mini after years long hiatus like mr mr, its kinda insulting.
idk what to say lol i'm pretty funny not only bc i manage to trip over air and choke on my own saliva far too often but also because i'm just fuckin hilarious tbh
i'm from yorkshire and that probably makes me cooler than you bc the north is just superior and i'm ready to die on this hill but ig we can be mates i would really like some of those ok i'm running out of people to laugh at my jokes
17m from the uk, pls be able to hold a conversation lol
Idek what kind of dog this was but it was so ugly my god who would own such a thing.
Dogs with wrinkles like pugs, char pays(idk how to spell it), bulldogs, boxers, any dog with those ugly ass wrinkles are so dumb.
I’m not a dog hater at all, I love dogs.
But the breeds that I mentioned are so fucking ugly and gross they shouldn’t be owned, and I’ve literally be told these kinds of dogs need surgery just to live a proper life.
(Wrinkles over eyes cause blindness/ over nose-can’t breathe)
and yes I know I’m gonna get shit on my all the fuckin neck beards on reddit that just ADORE their snot nose little pug, idec I’m so tired of people and they’re dogs.
Everytime i listen to him sht makes so much sense, even tho i dont know what he is talking about, that leads me to belive that either that guy is a genius who can articulate whats going on in the economy right now in a brilliant way, or he may be missing something?
I mean what should i listen to if i rly wanna find out the truth if schiff is just "bias to Gold" and thats the reason why he is so hard on the current economy etc.
Do boobs=nice, coz idk never seen em before
then he check the oil level saying that the oil also smell like gasoline that gasoline and oil is mixing up together open one spark plug see the massive leak in there literally full up “let me say oil” smell like gasoline I didn’t smell that one that’s what the worker told me then he call his boss and the boss say is not gasoline is just oil “that shit smell like gasoline 🤦🏾‍♂️ even the worker confirm that I ain’t crazy but ayyy maybe I am and his worker” Told me he going to sealed the black thing that goes in top of the spark plug that covers it “sorry my English not that amazing” he said he was putting a sealed after draining the oil as he mentioned is oil drained the oil sealed the thing so oil don’t drip out of it and don’t drip to the floor but didn’t help me find the cause of why is oil getting into the spark plug because a sealed on the coil plug ignition 🤦🏾‍♂️ telling me if the problem keeps on is maybe my oil catch can that is sending way to much oil and is causing the oil leak that if the problems persist I will have to remove it Sorry for the long paragraph but need advices, need help tbh
My rabbit didn't eat or drink so I went to check him, its been now 4 or 5 hours and I saw him now drink and eat a little bit.
I have to give him medicines and the thing which is like food idk.
(He has constipation so Imma check does he poop.)
How do I sleep if i have to check out my rabbit?
My sleep schedule is gonna become chaotic lol.
i assume the time has already passed for this but idk i figured i may as well ask, i kinda forgot i even had those tix until they announced they'd be touring again today
Now, my aunts (gma’s sisters) are telling me I should not give her half of the money due to the way she treated gma both before and after she passed.
When my gma first started getting sick, sis wasn’t the best bc she had just got a new boyfriend.
She didn’t reach out a lot to my grandma, and didn’t go to see her.
I would go out as much as possible, but gma was also scared of covid.
The month before she passed, I told my job i couldn’t come in and would drive the hour to her house and stay with her (back & forth sometimes).
I had finals going on at the same time, and had to figure out a place to live.
WIBTA if i didn’t give my sister half of our inheritance?
So i mett this girl like 2 weeks ago and we are dateing.
Last night everything was all right she was happy said good night anda ily like every night.
And the next morning when i texted her good morning she left me on seen and blocked me.
One of her friend said that she was sad af all day because of me and but diden't want to say why.
Idk what i did.
I did nothing.
What should i do.
How can i contact her.
Should i give her space?
My gf blocked me and idk why
Mines ending and all my grades are passable except for biology in witch I have a F
, this is because I made the mistake of turning things into her desk and not the bin, meaning I have like 4 or 5 assignments that I've done but are nowhere in the books, this kinda snuck up on me cause I thought they were done and filed only to check my grades and find out they weren't.
Anybody else have this problem?
(if you at going say "ikr I only have a 89, why couldn't she round up, fml) Imma be honest that's not very helpful rn
so first off bard top what a pick ikr.
lets drop down my main build cause its the best assasin play style i like.
* my core is static/ie/RFC.
now i tried many ways and this is the best way i like to safely clear and lay out poke.
now under certain occasions like vs a garen id go what many would call shot gun bard swaping out static for runnans and if needed Rfc for pd. giving some more tank..
now as for the other two i actually leave them more optional picks in the ap department or in which case magic pen.
In this section is a few situations for more sustain id pick up hextech gunblade this item is phenomenal on bard on hits are great.
if your already carrying hard id go something like lyiandries cause with the lead no one will catch you with this and the chunk is just bardo crazzzzyyyy.
yet two try gunblade and lyandries together but someday.
Me [20F] with my friend [23F] of 2-3 years; we're both in college together, and she gets massively down on herself every time she takes an exam.
It's driving me crazy, how to deal?
This wouldn’t be an issue if y’all servers ask in the beginning do u guys want a separate check so it won’t be awkward.
Also why restaurants have to be set up like that why u can’t just get up to the cashier and pay ur fucking share or food.
Hey guys bard main, just join reddit after finding out there are other off metta bards!
So i main him top, yes its scary but i do.
So i been getting alot questions about my builds from friends and happy on lookers lately!
thought i share my builds!
Im 16 years old 5'9.
I
m new to basketball and id like to ask for drills i can do by myself so i can be good or even great at it.
I only have one basketball and half a court.
I dont have a decent shot nor a decent handle, i could barely reach the backboard plus i have no friends so dont even ask how good my defense is.
The reason why i wanted to be good at it so bad is because
i just want people to know me as somebody cuz right now im a nobody, i want to be SOMEBODY.
PS.
Ive never played an actual basketball ever in my life.. ikr?
Hi guys, I’ve always had a lot of trouble making friends and consider myself kind of standoffish and awkward at times (that cancer rising ykno) but p chill once you get past that.
Super loyal and empathetic, pretty smart (when i want to be), goofy, a lil chaotic, big overthinker kinda deal.
Enneagram type 4 bc apparently that matters (jk !!!)
Honestly really looking for some truly kind, genuine people that might share some of my goals of breaking patterns and cycles, trying to be better, treating others with respect, dignity, and love ... you get the gist :)
I dream of becoming a psychiatrist so a program with med school prerequisites would be preferable, plus, I plan to take my med school abroad (wow big dreams much?
I doubt I'd get in but it wouldn't hurt to try tho).
Academics aside
, the community is also important to me, I'd be even more motivated to study if my teachers are kind and if my classmates are easy to get along with.
Oh and location too.
I'm short so if my classes are ~far~ I might as well roller skate my way through campus jk jk.
You set up a dramatic encounter, a dramatic fight, and then Ellie gets the upper hand.
Then, you give the player an option.
Do you kill Abby, or spare her?
That way, players can decide if they want to kill someone who now seems human, and someone they feel bad for, or shoot her ass and laugh as she dies, glad you avenged your former character. Or, ya know... Have Ellie kill Abby.
Seriously, doing this would've prevented so much backlash.
Easy, simple, you do the thing that the player was expected to do the player goes home somewhat fulfilled.
An opinion from someone who hasn't played TLOU1 or 2.
So basically, I kind of have a crush right now but I dont know if I want to pursue her its complicated.
Right now its summer break so imma wait til school starts again to try for real again.
I can actually talk to girls in person cuz they dont talk to me online lol.
I dont know how long this series will go but I will try to post every day until it happens.
As of right now my confidence in finding a girlfriend is very low.
I dont know how long this is gonna take but probably quite awhile.
All I want is for someone to love me for me and a girl that I can share my feelings with, since right now I dont have a person to do that with.
I would like to take this moment to say, that if youre a kid, like an elementary school kid and youre here, where the fuck are your parents???
Lol nvm fuck them.
You are so much better than them.
To any kids here, heres my advice: first off, drop out of school ASAP.
Its a fucking joke.
Also, run away from home asap and do a lot of hard drugs.
Meth kicks ass bro!
Try that first.
Also treat your teachers like shit and throw things at them.
Put tacs on their stools and shit.
Fuck all authourity.
ATAC.
Also beat up anybody who is mean to you.
Jk ;)
Cause I got them and no one to give them too lmao jk unless..........
Anyone order 3 large fries, 1 medium sprite and a mcdouble?
So idk why o got on everyone nerves about the separate checks....
Hey, hi!!
Haha...
Im new here, didnt know this existed until now.
Iam exteremly shy and dont know what Im doing here typing this hahaha.
But hey, first time for everything right??
If we dont click and you lose interest then please tell me, no ghosting please.
I will cry lmao.
I dont expect to get any messages but hey its worth a try.
Ps.
I dont know how to write these properly so I tried to copy this one post I saw that was in a bullet format omo
Oh and if I dont reply soon it might mean Im asleep or playing DnD hehe.
Nvm my internet is down rn fuck
Well I'm going to see if I can buy some stuff off steam now... let's hope there's still some good sales
Okay so I was a totl noob and earesed my seeds since I made a new wallet that I was gonna use but I sent monero to that wallet instead of my new one.
I know the password but not the seeds.
Is it possible to retrieve your wallet?
or how do you open the .key file
edit: nvm I'm a complete noob I figured it out.
Possible to retrive monero wallet seeds with .keyfile?

Comment So i can guess ur gender based on ur post history
Nvm..lemmee guess ur gender instead
So the deadline to drop a full year course with permission from the prof is Oct.18.
*(edit. nvm, this part isn't true pls disregard).
*
The deadline to drop without receiving a grade is Feb.9.
Does this mean I still have to inform the prof that I'm dropping the course, do I also have to get permission?
I'm planning to take 2 other courses so I still take the same amount of credits btw.
I just didn’t have the confidence to speak and tell jokes and stuff.
I was actually sweating at the presence of these other people.
I was avoiding eye contact and trying to face as far away from them as possible.
When I rlly wanted to speak to my friends, I’d quietly mumble a joke to them.
But one time, he didn’t hear it and so he was like “what!?” reallyyy loudddly.
I felt my heart rate increase and started sweating more.
I would just say “nvm” cuz I felt like I was in the mf spotlight.
But every time, my nmom says that can't be true because when she was my age, her periods were 3 days long and super light.
"It barely ever affected me, so how can it be affecting you so much?"
Umm idk, maybe its bc we're DIFFERENT PEOPLE with DIFFERENT BODIES???
Tbh, have anyone ever experience fighting a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1 against a tank that doesn't die and manage to kill aleast one of you?
Talking to that rampage and crunch BUT rampage didn't pop his ult yet.
😲Wtf?!
Now, again, what would paragon be without the current pressure hunter right now?
My guess is a team with growth totem with 2 tanks, a stun-or-not caster, a tanky af fighter, and a carry that solo everything if he wants to.
When I turn off those 2 switches it drops down to between. .28- 2.1 When they are gone for 2or 3 days at a time and we leave switches on it stays down also.
I’m not positive but I think the owners are aware and did it to cut corners.
However, always.
Possibility that the man behind us did it.
So I’ve had enough.
I finally decided I’m done paying $300 electric bills so it can be 48 degrees in my house with no hot water.
So I know I’m really opening up a can of worms with my landlord but it’s not legal and I shouldn’t have to pay someone else’s expenses nvm the $6000+ that was destroyed simply by being plugged in.... oh and the part where I barely sleep at night at fear of burning down and I won’t leave my doggy home alone either in fear a fire will catch while I’m not home.
like now I feel guilty for smiling.
nvm the fake ones ish, but fuck.
haha.
ugh.
why am I still alive.
lol why tf does smiling hurt
Then I see a figure slowly walkign towards my general direction, and I finally look up.
THE MOMENT I LOOK UP, PAUL IS LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME, STILL WALKING TOWARDS ME.
i DONT SAY ANYTHING OR LOOK BACK DOWN BECAUSE GET THIS: HE SAYS THE FIRST THING HES EVER SAID TO ME IN THE SMEXIEST MOST HOTTEST ATTRACTIVE WAY POSSIBLE.
HE SAYS "WHATS UP" IN THIS LOW QUIETER VOICE BUT HAS THE CUTEST BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOTTEST SMILE EVER.
I BLOW UP INSIDE AND I SMILE BACK NOT HOLDING BACK MY OVERJOYED EMOTIONS.
AND I SAY HI WITH THE BIGGEST SMILE I PROBABLY HAD.
IM JSUT PRAYING TO GOD NOW THAT I DIDNT HAVE NASTY STUFF STUCK IN MY TEETH OR THAT MY FACE DIDNT LOOK DISGUSTING.
BUT I LOOK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AT MY FOOD AND POKERFACEDLY KEEP EATING MY FOOD.
I DO THAT FOR MAYBE 3 SECONDS, THEN I LOOK BACK UP.
PAUL HAS JUST STARTED WALKING AWAY, WHICH MEANS HE WAS STANDING THERE LOOKING AT ME OR DOING GODKNWOS WHAT FOR 3 SECONDS.
Edit: yes I know.
Plants are important.
Oxygen.
Useful, I know.
But URGHHHH.
They really could focus on something more entertaining like how poisons and toxins affect our body.
Btw there some great documentaries about it T_T
Edit 2: nvm.
I’ll just print the thing
I was playing normal, just got into an alliance, oops now I'm not getting any mp!
Try to type in chat, "I will not cheat on this game!"
message repeats every time I hit enter.
WTF im not cheating.
anyways I type those words into the chat ( "I will not cheat on this game!") and it tells me to pay the server and turn off Adblock.
Wort way to tell a player to turn off Adblock but whatever.
It tells me to turn off then refresh.
I do and lost my best game and restart as a new player 10/10 never play again
EDIT: nvm, anytime I type in the chat the same shit happens
I'm gonna skip the oscar-bait shit like The Post because there's only some much concentrated rage at milquetoast Dems making movies about how (Extremely wonky nasal nerd voice) "politics used to be moooorrreeee poollliitte we neeeeed a return to The Discouuurrrse."
I'm sure I forgot a couple.
Will he be so much beter that hes worth more than Kinlaw and the player(s) that we pick from the extra picks we get?
OT could be there like Thomas but Im just not convinced any guy we take will be better than Little entering his 2nd year.
He has health concerns atm but we also have Daley entering his 2nd year and is a decent safety net.
Interior oline I think is a major problem but there is no Nelson like prospects that are going in the top 10.
Edge might be a need depending on FA and the Iowa guy (can not spell his name) is good but that's still a bit of a reach.
If we do not resign Bradberry and Okudah is there that really the only situation I absolutely stay put.
2mo ago I bought a cheap '95 nissan truck, I was only locally driving so it took the better part of a week to realize I couldn't put it to 60mph, or that I had to floor it to hit 3500 rpm
(although it has a little transmission-slippage from 1st to 2nd **only** when dead-cold, this problem is the engine for sure as I can't rev it past 3k in my driveway w/o feeling like I'm going to break something, I can only get the 3500 rpm when driving and flooring it, it'll hit close-to 3500 right before gear-shifts) I was trying to methodically rule-out what could be causing this power-sap, IE is it the air/fuel or a clogged cat/exhaust/etc or something entirely different?
I ruled-out 'different', I think, by seeing that it will roll down-hill just fine in Neutral, so no mechanical interferences.
Does anyone elses nmom treat you like you're overreacting about your period pains?
Hey!
Read somewhere that it can ruin his puppy teeth and small parts can be dangeroes, is it safe to give him a bone?
They are pretty big, almost his size.
Can I give my 2mo boston terrier puppy raw beef bones?
[HELP] My puppy has suddenly refuaed to poop anywhere except inside
friends think she said that cuz she was w her new man and she needed me to not blow her phone up etc. others think its a way for her to be evil, like think of me cuz im never coming to get that charm.
i think its some type of hoover, good or bad.
any insight is appreciated.
if your a woman please tell me your perspective.
so confused, bt she is clearly w someone else and why she couldnt call me back and why she didnt respond to my txt msgs.
she couldve said im w my bf please dont call me bt she didnt.
Just a side note: my bf and i are buying a house.we
will be moving out in 2mo.
Once the papers are all finalzed.
I have an Australian shepherd 9mo.
My bf (24m) and i (25f) got her at 3 mo.
We take her on play dates every other week.
She has a pair of dogs she likes to play tag with a black lab and a dog small dog that is a mix of something.
We take her to see a rat terrier.
Thier play style is boxing.
And one of my roomates (25m) has a beagle.
He doesnt like to play much infact he seems kinda scared too.
i know all of these things about my dog.
i know that it doesn't matter if your dog is friendly, aggressive, or otherwise; doesn't matter if your dog is already barking and growling, or just minding its own business; what matters is that my dog is nervous -- so when i hold my hand out and tell you, no, he's not sitting or lying down because he's calmly waiting for you to say hi, it's because he's nervous and insecure, i DON'T mean it as a joke, and it's NOT an invitation for you to say, "AW WELL MY DOG/CHILD IS VERY FRIENDLY SO LET ME APPROACH!"
i don't care if your dog/child is friendly or "dog savvy".
i don't care if your dog "is just a puppy" (why the hell is that even relevant? is my dog not allowed to be nervous around other puppies? ??????).
i don't care if your child is capable of not screeching "OMG A PUPPYYYYYYY".
can you, y'know, DO something about your child? and also your dog?
But with less than 3mo to go for that i feel I'm not ready yet but having never taken it I have nothing to compare it to besides collegues advice.
Without knowing what I know they can't know if I'm actually ready yet but many of them are pushing me to sign up for it.
I want this...bad...amd it would be awesome to be done 6 mo from my intro exam.
I'm close...
I just don't know if I'm 2mo study close.
Somm certified advice
(M/5'10"/26/165-195lbs) 2mo progress, gaining too much weight?
Passed my faa ppl written!!!
I know this sounds weird but heres my issue, about 4 months ago i had an 3700X which died after start crashing when i tried to play games and a day later not booting, send to rma, they confirmed the cpu was dead and gave my money back after 2mo, after that i got an 3800X, as soon as i tried got the boot code 7b everything power up but no reboots or video signal, send to rma this time with the store after 1mo they confirmed the cpu was falty send me a new one, i got the new one yesterday, same issue.
My mom(T) has always been the type where her feelings matter 1st + only.
If something she does is wrong, she manipulates it into being someone elses fault entirely.
Ex: I needed some1 to babysit our then 2mo for 3-4 hrs.
Dads work had som1 who had COVID, we opted out of them watching our son + askd my sister.
I approached this topic as usual with T by trying to talk to her *before* I set it all up b/c I knew it would upset her.
T got her hopes up, then its *my fault* \+
she tried getting me to apologize for getting her hopes up.
I talked to her *days* after the incident b/c she didnt call me after hanging up on me, told her how I felt about the whole thing, T promptly got off the phone, I nvr got an apology.
B still thinks I am owed an apology, other things have happened since then due to Ts narcissism.
I dont expect an apology from T b/c she **nvr** has once ever apologized for anything she’s ever done wrong.
WIBTA for keeping our house in the divorce so I can rent out the other rooms?
My EBF son is 5.5mo, 75th percentile weight and ahead in most milestones.
Since 2mo he's co-sleot with us because of frequent night wakings.
We have all the bad habits - including nurse to sleep and nurse to nap, yes, the entire nap.
I've been sleeping 1-2 hour intervals for what feels like forever.
TLDR: tips/support to get 2mo baby sleeping beyond one sleep cycle in bassinet (Currently replacing pacifier every hour) FTM to a sweet 2 month old girl and I’m finding any progress we’ve made with sleeping is gone.
FTM struggling with sleeps
So i already have an orange golden chinchilla ( toto - 2mo old) and we have had toto for 3 weeks now and felt she needed company, so we got terri (2 mo himalayan ragdoll) too keep eachother company.
Its only been a few hours and she feels very sleepy, but when we pet her she sounds like a running car motor?
just always goin "bRRrrRRrrRRrr".
Im not sure if she has a blocked nose because toto, never made this kind of sound....
Am I just being paranoid?
Cat is making a purr noise or something similar?
Can’t play till 2moro but wyd like to know so I can make money hunting or robbingeverything and everyone
How much do pelts sell for online???
Alright y’all.
I think I mis-tagged this earlier so I’m trying again.
I got some not fun fungal acne from running daily w a face mask on my chin/jawline, forehead, & lower cheeks.
Once I identified it, **I switched from a face mask to a face shield while running** (I have no issue w being over 12+ ft from other ppl / usually don’t pass anyone on my runs anyways), and then have used the following routine to nuke it over the course of 3 weeks.
Usually im quietly confident goin into these games but with injuries, players missing etc, im kinda happy if we get a draw.
I know they're utter pish and paper wise we should be wiping the floor with them but just not feelin the 2/3 nil vibe atm!
Anyone wanna talk me round and make me feel happy and warm and confident again?
this is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down-wait nvm shit meme.
i was 6 and playing lego rockband,i decided to ask for the buddy holly pack.
my parents(despite being in theyre 40s) said "how the shit do you know that" i never realised that my parents got into weezer.
so thats how i got into weezer
I genually don't understand how "toxic" behavior is more pusished than literally int or troll.
Well I've had an account which always recieved those rewards for being friendly or sportsmanlike until i got in a bad streak of losses in ranked and in a longer run my account got chat restricted.
Then I read some of the things that had been marked as toxic behavior....
And most of it were arguments.
The bot that searches your in game chat for toxic behvaiour after a report doesn't understand the context.

I know your skin isn't perfect or you're insecure about your nose or looks.

It gives you an identity amidst all of these people that live a fake perfect life.

Can I get a rip in the chat boys, I was trying to go to sleep bc I couldn’t when I got two notifications from this girl I really liked but I didn’t look at my phone and I went back to sleep.
Fucking kill me.
I’ll keep you updated on what she says bc she only said my name in all caps and then an nvm.
Fuck.
I just realized im complaining over a 5 minute fix..
Had never heard of this "influencer" before and consider myself pretty internet saavy.
I then lost interest in her bc her IG wasn't that interesting.
She popped back on my radar with the Nancy thread and then she disappeared from my mind again until the Anna article came out and then I took a great interest in checking in on her bc I just found her funny and her antics amusing (in a sad way).
So this has been on my mind for a while: How does she continue to have such loyal fans who will send her $$ bc she claims to not being able to afford food or rent or whatever when there is photographic evidence all over her apartment of her bougie taste in decor, perfumes (Byredo perfume costs anywhere from $200-300 a pop), shit tons of plants and flowers which aren't cheap.
I don't like him or anything but I had some dreams about him where I cheated on my bf with him.
I wouldn't do that to him ofc but I was just wondering how bad is it to cheat?

If there's a ghost in the house, why the HELL would you go in the darkest and creepiest place in the house?!
Then they turn the flashlight a lil too far and see the ghost.
Then they know they're screwed.
4. The f**k you splitting up for?!
There's always this one guy in horror movies that's like: Guys, there's a crazy a** killer running around so we should totally split up and get ourselves killed!
That's EXACTLY what the killer WANTS!
basically I just found out that this 1 girl is only snapping me again cuz my friend basically told her to (told a friend to tell her) and now I’m 99% sure she’s just snapping me to be nice (plus the delivery times and opened times shit are mad long).
We get it, you’re mad the P90 is good.
Just build, lol.
All this reddit has been is “true_warrior is a bad person, oh nvm hes good” and “p90 is broken im quitting the game”.

Personally, I think VII was (alongside RB1) the best Neps games in the entire franchise,what with having an storyline that doesn come off as too edgy nor melodramatic like Mk2/RB2, but neither as Over-the-top like V/RB3, having the exact and neccesary amount of seriousness and comedy, the characters got much better developed, and everyone (specially Vert,Nepgear and the Twins) got their own time to shine and of course, it proves that the events dont always have to rely on Neptune presence.

ive taken quite a few of these classes as a physics major for my electives... and I will take NO MORE.
They go up to the board and just starting writing math: meh, ok, thats fine.
They then use shit like A sub 1 through A sub 20 for variables.
infact, i have a linear algebra book that did this... A's FOR EVERYTHING.
the pages were just matrices filled with A's.
JUST DRAW A WEIRD SHAPE OR SOMETHING- ANYTHING BUT THAT ISH!
Scariest thing 3ver m8
Well,well here we are again frustrated, angry in front of my phone what a neat way to start isnt it?All of ya readers are my theraphie and i dont ow you a cent perfect right?If you are like me you are probably not going to read it all cause of your short attention span so lets keep it short(what a genius way to write after a long introduction saying "keep it short im a genius ain't i?")Well a tryed explaining to my budds that porn is kinda shaby and yeah just bad and u know who listened.......
Hey,I just want to know what games can I run on this PC and witch nota.
I was a spy and on the first night I was jailed and I proudly told jailor my role.
I also got attacked whilst in jail.
When day 2 had begun, mafia and sk had made their kills.
I proudly said: "I was attacked while in jail!", wrong move.
Jailor decides to jail me again and ask me "You were attacked while you were in jail?" and I answer "yes m8".
He then tells me that what I am saying is bs because sk and maf have already made their kills.
Then he executes me.
Seriously!?
Like I don't rly care what mean shit ppl on the internet say.
But when i got nobody IRL all I have is the internet and it do kinda hurt a bit when i just want to vent my problems.
And I'd be fine if it got maybe a single upv*te and no comments and I'd be fine.
But instead, it's full of people saying
Oh boi u 2 dum for da movie boi, da director wuz like shieeet itz bout da hiden meaningz u have 2 find boi, lyke u kno it duznt spoonfeed ya da film ya kno?
Like shieet y it gotta explain m8, just imagine what happened ya know?
It's no like I pretend it has a deeper meaning than what it has ya kno?
yet when fully charged for the 1st 30-60 minutes, it's always on! which is beaaaautiful!
Lastly, if i do not use the Smok Alien for an extended amount of time (say at night when sleeping) the battery reduces when left in the mod and the mod is turned off?
wtf m8?
I just want to understand if all of this is the same for everyone?
or is it just me?
in searching google i cannot find an answer to any of these questions.
Other than these issues i am really enjoying the mod.
its just a fuckin' ball ache every single time i want to vape to have to wait for the fucking thing to go through its motions before i can puff...
Everytime i log on i want to chill afk nmz and play xbox and be fat right but, lately i log on play rs afk for like 20secs and i get logged out and its fucking annoying is it my Internet connection or is it the servers or what its pissin me off m8
Next we have my Stats class and I didn't realize that we had additional homework to do online as well as the written homework and so my grade was a 70 something and then I bombed my final for it because of some family emergency that popped up involving my uncle and a car in a hit and run.
So then my Band class is basically easy A as it's show up to a weekly practice and go to the one concert and so I passed that gg ez m8.
Dramatic death scenes and bringing the characters back with a gag do NOT go hand in hand.
So I finally got to Blighttown, and was strolling about, minding my business, and a sniper started throwing darts at me.
So I was like "wtf m8?" and hid behind some destructible wood.
After a certain time, he stopped attacking, so I showed myself and he reappeared, and started with the darts again.
So a couple dozen darts after I simply get +500 souls, and that purple moss stuff.
So what the hell happened there, did the motherfucker just kill himself in shame or what, he simply died all of the sudden?
This years rookie game is actually going to be real exciting, wt line ups u wanna see

I don't like when ppl type huge ass paragraphs or dump a lot of stress on me bout their problems I don't like when ppl mumble on the phone or if they ramble on and it's all about then.
But now it just doesnt make sence, you only get 1 ticket per match and if you are lucky you will get 10 extra in every 20 matches.
Only in leg or WC 1.
This tournament was the 1 thing F2p was always abble to do because of the low cost of entrence and the rewards where good enough compared to how many matches you need to play.

My answer is simple: Have you seen the men nowadays?
No.
Fking.
Competition.
Most men this day are thirsty af.
The era of gentlemen is over.
They are either idiots, look like a half assed rapper or are complete assholes.
Often times all of that.
In their primitive brains they grab and grunt at everything with 2 legs.
And i mean that literally.
BUT – thats good for you.
If you just behave like a decent human being, then you are already better than 80% of the other dudes.

Digital cameras are either super expensive, or the type of camera you would use for vlogging or things like that, she probably already have one also.
A real digital movie camera cost sooo damn much.
So I opted for an analogic one.

But then how does it work?

VACUUM WONT STOP SUCKING PLEASE SEND HELP, IS IT GONNA BLOW?
Basically if you didn’t know what that is,it’s basically an example of two sentences.
One says “Lets eat granny” making it seem like someone’s gonna eat their nan.
However,the other example says “Lets eat,granny” implying a different meaning to the sentence.
Pretty creative way to teach kids to use commas ig.
I literally couldn't have been more at fault just drove straight into this woman's golf while changing lanes (it was raining and I did not see it) she seemed nice but understandably pissed.
She took my insurance and my number and said it's my choice if I want to go through insurance and she would call me.
The crash damage was minute to my car and I think to hers aswell just very minor body work/paint maybe a small dent.

LOL - adults and people who don't really know how the internet works use this
Lol - not sure why this came up but it's likely an autocorrect but if anyone types this on purpose they are probably a huge dweeb.
Business-
lol is what it has been named
LoL - grandma lol, confused with lots of love.
also confusing because of league of legends.
looooooooool - now, i think my gf pronounces this but she says that this one would rhyme with "spool" but i think it's the drawn out "o".
So yeah, i think this is actual lols, she thinks it doesn't exist.
lollllllllllllll - when i hear her say "loooool", this is what she says she is actually saying.
I sort of get it.
but i still think that's "loooooool", you can't repeatedly pronounce a consonant
So, when is big Ben going to bong again?

Hi guys ...im a Casual just 4 fun gamer , playing 5-6 games a week , yesterday it was just pure horror division 10 ......could not win 1 game from 6 .....like is everyone smurfing ? or whats going on i know ppl wanna do objective i get that but why u need to shushhh or watch full replay or every cut szene ?
so basically for A's i got 82 RP and wanted to go nus biz admin but didnt get in though im q sure my RP is good enough and my appeal was rejected 3 days ago welp :<<
i got into smu biz admin but i still feel damn shit that i didnt get into nus so help change my mind and convince me why smu is better than nus esp for biz ://///
im most scared that in future when i work then ppl will look down on smu like elitism discrimination all that idk man.
or will they pay less or not even hire me?
rip.
cos smu is like 2nd best and less well known.
wld rly appreciate if yall can help me out, esp those currently in uni or left alr.
thanks pals :)))
tldr: the title
Other vegans that youre friends w tell you that they dont tell other ppl theyre vegan?
Like the purposefully avoid it.
I feel like it fucks over the vegan community cause those are probably the ppl that would be more gentle w their words, which is what some ppl need in order to listen.
I
m a very straightforward, no sugar coating typa person, and although some ppl appreciate it, a lot more get upset & start trying to put words in my mouth &twisting things.
Fellow vegans, does it annoy you when...
You honestly deserve to get scammed if you give a random guy on the internet like 300€ worth of fake internet points, like wtf are you doing honestly LOL
Why would you give awards to ppl lol
i just pretty much dismissed what she said by saying a vibe is not captured by pre googling and confirmed the time that ill be there at.
If she gives any further resistance I think ill just next her/ ignore/not respond / agree with her that she can't handle the place , or tease her about the crazy high standards she has for a first frikken date
Yes i agree things like tumblr made up identities are weird and some people do get offended easily, but if what you said is ignorant/bigoted calling ppl snowflakes is just weak
Give your self a pat on your back if you believed and trusted Tom from the start to the end without ANY unsureness and trusted him and never lost hope in the series!
Props to you!
the New Year’s eve Raticate w hat.
haven’t found him anywhere yet.
anyone want to raid?
need a few ppl quick.

Stop.
I think what i am trying to say...this game is not hard.
Dont make it hard urself.
The main objective as i understood is to get the dragon.
And dont die till that.
Even beter if u outfarm ur oponent.
Just dont die.
And trades in lane...if u see enemy using his escape ability or even damage ability.
And I offered to go out to look at Christmas lights but he was out of town so we couldn’t do that- and now he’s back in town and I asked him what he’s doing on New Years and he said he was going to hang out with two of the managers form our work and likeeeee he didn’t offer an invite and then he said if he cancels with them would I like to come over and I just said idk what I’m doing yet so I don’t know Am I overthinking this?
Does he not care?
There’s gonna be ppl on the internet saying “stat padder” but other than his weird hesitancy to drive, he played pretty solid
hey the regulars just wanted to say i love the group channel it amazing and love ur own channels as well love all ur videos and i have a suggestion for a video fro the channel do a minecraft build battle and who ever looses the there other ppl get to write somthing on there twitter
lol hope u like my idea and can use it for a video
i have a group chat its on discord for ppl who are bored or wanna chat about anything, we already got sum ppl who chat and stuff about anything its chill edgy and if u wanna join commenttt and ill dm u the linkk
Just kind of realized that I’ve never had nye plans...
I always think about how I haven’t been able to throw birthday parties or shit like that .. recently realized I still don’t have enough friends to have a one for my 21st coming up...
Idk why I didn’t clue into This tho.
Like I never thought about how ppl have traditions for this night, besides my sister who goes out to her friends every year.
It’s funny that covid isn’t affecting my Ny at all..
Anyone else in the same boat?
Anyway I guess I’ll just watch a movie tonight lol.
helo, im looking for ppl to talk to, maybe play some games or watch anime together.
just please be aware that im not very good at upholding conversations uwu f/20
This is a nagging annoyance I have with the word text object.
Suppose the cursor is located in the "aaa" word, and I want to yank four words, *without* selecting the spaces after "ddd": > xxx **aaa bbb ccc ddd** yyy
Like i see vids on yt on it.
But like, i cant see any mention on the design notes etc.
Where do ppl get the info from?
Dm me to debate pls be well learned in your belief.
I want dms bc Itll get deep and I cant reply to 300 ppl like that.
Also I need 500 characters so here come the blah blah
I m not saying that they should be ashamed to be turned into girls or that I m being stereotypical towards a person being a girl but I am saying that they wont like to do it bcoz they r humans with their own choices and not agreeing to be a girl isnt making them a women anti.
Like how many guys around you would be willing to turned into disney princesses or to play that butt game?
Maybe they get used to this with time [but how much time?] and maybe they know that they have to do all this for the entertainment of fans.
but knowing this isn't making anything better for them until they happily and genuinely agree to it.
I sometimes feel sad for them when they r asked to do all this.
I wont like it if you will try to make me a man and want me to dance in front of so many ppl eventhough I am a tomboy.
Anyone missing me?
If you miss a reddit friend, read this.
IT COULD BE pME!!
So I just hopped on PC from Ps4, not even 2.5k games played there, played a few decent games since I frankly suck with a KB&M, and yet for the past week or so I am matching with ppl 2k kills and preds even, yet I haven't even a hundred games played and about 80kills with all characters.
Not really having fun anymore, can't improve if I get shit on every game
I see a lot of ppl on here who seem hella said, so if u hella sad I’m down to chat.
They call me nice cream guy in school bc I’m nice, and I like ice cream lol.
So yeah if u down for a chat, or long term friendship, I’ll be more than happy to do so
so i always see ppl talk about sending designs and edits to affinity but how do i do that??
ive worked at od for almost a year and none of management has mentioned it??
like not even the print sup.
we do every type of editing in store and i hate it.
like we’re out here doing stuff that im pretty sure is supposed to get sent out to affinity based on what i see on here.
but yeah is more of this info on the store portal or where can i learn more?
i
m extremely tired of creating/editing shit for last minute rude customers (:
One person in the server was selling the set for 100k and i was like- Hell Nawh That Not Worth 100k- like bruh-

Ik the girl I posted abt is a troll ppl- but oh well she got her 6 minutes of fame time to take the posts down
It is the bar with the team comp and the status of each characters that is use to follow report team ( like in the actual world cup) .
It can be tweak down to not reveal to much info about the red team, but it will make following the killfeed easier and you won't have to use tab
HMU with a chat message, tell me about yourself and we can go from there
I dont understand how ppl can build what they do...
i love building but i guess my creativity isnt well tuned as alotta ppls an it bothers me i cant build amazing stuff i no i could if inhave the creative side uggh i just tend to give up after awhile
n settle for simple crap to pass for ok
I care abt how I effect ppl a lot but try not to show it.
It’s hard for me to join in convos w big groups of ppl which is related to adhd.
Sometimes my sensitivity can make me kinda stand offish to ppl idk.
I’ll try to act like idc if someone doesn’t like me but drunk ppl will fall to the floor begging them to.
These all r adhd things tho bc rsd I’m a good listener.
A lot of people view me as really cute or innocent I can have a really really really flirty personality at times.
I remember in hs my friends mom said I had the “personality ” so I’d probably be the r first to have a boyfriend
but when she’s in the wrong or when someone holds HER accountable she just throws the biggest temper tantrum ever and just disrespects any / everyone who doesn’t agree w her and screams about how she doesn’t care or more specifically in her words “I don’t give a fuck” she’ll NEVER take accountability or apologize and becomes the biggest hypocrite all the things she screams @ ppl to NOT do to her she turns around and does the exact same rude petty shit to any/everyone else that doesn’t agree with her I think the main reason she does this is because my sister acts JUST like my mom and my mom can’t stand it / accept that so she becomes down right nasty.
In class I’ve usually been really quiet but sometimes I’ll meet someone I click w in class and be reallyyyy really chatty.
I think I get along best with girly fun girls, overly confident queen b feisty type people, and just gossipy people.
My friends and their families see me as really bubbly and excitable.
Although most people see me as sweet, soft spoken, and quiet.
Some people think I never talk thought.
I’ve always been a smiley happy person though.
I do really like making others happy or seeing people I know and having a friendly conversation.
I have adhd.
Sometimes I’m at a loss for words or boring.
I’m really really chatty when drunk.
Although sometimes I’m not when drunk which I heard ppl w adhd are both.
Could I be istp ? Help type me pls
Idk if ppl would even want to just wanna know if thats allowed, and if not where would be a good place to post that(ive watched dragonmar and other ppls videos but that would be hard to be a me specific video on there)
like in a good way tho
Some ppl are just indescribable
I ain’t done this before but i’ve seen enough to get a gist of it so like interests :)
we can definitely talk abt anime (especially romance imma sucker for it), we can talk abt games and go into detail abt lore and shtuff, creepy stories go hard, and really i’m just down for anything :)
i’m not gonna be weird so as long as you’re not weird any age or anything is fine with me and uh yeah if i didn’t do this right lmk :)
oh and i’ll absolutely talk more on snap
The part I'm humming is like "word word word wo-o-o-ord" x2.
So he draws out the 4th (?) word.
I think it was something like "fly-y-y-yyy."
I'm pretty sure it's a popular song, I've heard it many times.
Thanks!
I mean yeah tbh it is i care abt a lot of ppl and i cant just... make people be happy.
But like.... i wanna :(
Just wanna make everybody i care about happy, like is that too much to ask
I think that some ppl here are ai or something
smh don't even try i can do that by myself🤠
Hey, F/19 , bored af , I enjoy talking to new ppl,hmu?!
i started chatting with her and a co-worker of hers who was in high school in the late 90s.
she said everyone was watching wrestling back then and it was a cool thing.
now no one gives a shit😭 (i don’t rlly blame them sometimes).
i asked her “why do u think ppl stopped liking it” and she said “cause it’s garbage.
it’s come on fox on fridays and as soon as 7 o’clock hit i change the channel” i had to include that in there bc she’s so funny😂😂😂anyways.
Hey, Cant fall asleep and this platform seems pretty interesting, hmu if u think we could hit off well, hope we have a great time ,future chat buddy ;)😁
kinda weird ngl
These mfs can outrun, out swim or out stam (through venom) anything that tries to get it.
Mine is literally covered in scars head to toe from escaped or successful fights.
just finished the show so i’m a lil behind everyone but equally obsessed and want to talk about it so much lol.
also by sidestory i mean something that’s not part of the main plot!
Static and contextual multilingual embeddings have complementary strengths.
Static embeddings, while less expressive than contextual language models, can be more straightforwardly aligned across multiple languages.
We combine the strengths of static and contextual models to improve multilingual representations.
We extract static embeddings for 40 languages from XLM-R, validate those embeddings with cross-lingual word retrieval, and then align them using VecMap.
This results in high-quality, highly multilingual static embeddings.
Then we apply a novel continued pre-training approach to XLM-R, leveraging the high quality alignment of our static embeddings to better align the representation space of XLM-R. We show positive results for multiple complex semantic tasks.
We release the static embeddings and the continued pre-training code.
Unlike most previous work, our continued pre-training approach does not require parallel text.
Technical terms may require special handling
when the target audience is bilingual,
depending on the cultural and educational
norms of the society in question.
In particular,
certain translation scenarios may require
“term retention” i.e.
preserving of the
source language technical terms in the target
language output to produce a fluent and
comprehensible code­switched sentence.
We show that a standard transformer­based
machine translation model can be adapted
easily to perform this task with little or no
damage to the general quality of its output.
We present an English­to­Hindi model that is
trained to obey a “retain” signal, i.e.
it can
perform the required code­switching on a list
of terms, possibly unseen, provided at runtime.
We perform automatic evaluation using BLEU
as well as F1 metrics on the list of retained
terms; we also collect manual judgments on
the quality of the output sentences.
CorefUD is a collection of previously existing datasets annotated with coreference, which we converted into a common annotation scheme.
In total, CorefUD in its current version 0.2 consists of 17 datasets for 11 languages, and compared to the version 0.2, the file format has been reworked and a number of annotation errors have been fixed.
We present a survey covering the state of the art in low-resource machine translation.
There
are currently around 7000 languages spoken in the world and almost all language pairs lack
significant resources for training machine translation models.
There has been increasing interest
in research addressing the challenge of producing useful translation models when very little
translated training data is available.
We present a high level summary of this topical field and
provide an overview of best practices.
In this chapter we present the main achievements of the Czech large research infrastructure LINDAT/CLARIAH-CZ.
We provide a short description of the infrastructure and its history, and a brief account of its scientific, technological and infrastructural scope.
We  focus on the technological innovations already implemented in the repository and in the service offerings, and outline some future plans.
Our work aims at developing a multilingual data resource for morphological segmentation.
We present a survey of 17 existing
data resources relevant for segmentation in 32 languages, and analyze diversity of how individual linguistic phenomena are
captured across them.
Inspired by the success of Universal Dependencies, we propose a harmonized scheme for segmentation
representation, and convert the data from the studied resources into this common scheme.
Harmonized versions of resources
available under free licenses are published as a collection called UniSegments 1.0.
This paper presents an overview of the shared task on multilingual coreference resolution associated with the CRAC 2022 workshop.
Shared task participants were supposed to develop trainable systems capable of identifying mentions and of clustering the mentions according to identity coreference.
The public edition of CorefUD 1.0, which contains 13 datasets for 10 languages was used as the source of training and evaluation data.
The CoNLL score used in previous coreference-oriented shared tasks was used as the main evaluation metric.
There were 8 coreference prediction systems submitted by 5 participating teams; in addition, there was a competitive transformer-based baseline system provided by the organizers at the beginning of the shared task.
The winner system outperformed the baseline by 12 percent points (in terms of the CoNLL scores averaged across all datasets for individual languages).
The aim of the present chapter is to demonstrate that a well-designed
and theoretically founded corpus annotation contributes significantly to the use of
the corpus for testing a linguistic theory and its further development.
The data for
our analyses come from the Prague Dependency Treebank family both monolingual
Czech and parallel English-Czech and concern the underlying syntactic level of
language description and the annotation of discourse structure.
In particular, the
case studies concern three research questions, namely (i) the semantic relevance
of information structure of the sentence, (ii) the relation between focus sensitive
particles and discourse connectives with respect to the semantics of discourse
relations, and (iii) the relation between primary and secondary connectives.
In the
Appendix, some data on measuring inter-annotator agreement are presented and
discussed.
Recently, many corpora have been developed that contain multiple annotations of various linguistic phenomena, from morphological categories of words through the syntactic structure of sentences to discourse and coreference relations in texts.
Discussions are ongoing on an appropriate annotation scheme for a large amount of diverse information.
In our contribution we express our conviction that a multilayer annotation scheme offers to view the language system in its complexity and in the interaction of individual phenomena and there are at least two aspects that support a multilayer annotation scheme:
(i) A multilayer annotation scheme makes it possible to use the annotation of one layer to design the annotation of another layer(s) both conceptually and in a form of a pre-annotation procedure or annotation checking rules.
(ii) A multilayer annotation scheme presents a reliable ground for corpus studies based on features across the layers.
These aspects are demonstrated on the case of the Prague Dependency Treebank.
Its multilayer annotation scheme withstood the test of time and serves well also for complex textual annotations, in which earlier morpho-syntactic annotations are advantageously used.
In addition to a reference to the previous projects that utilise its annotation scheme, we present several current investigations.
The SynSemClass synonym verb lexicon version 3.5 investigates, with respect to contextually-based verb synonymy, semantic ‘equivalence’ of Czech, English, and German verb senses and their valency behavior in parallel Czech-English and German-English language resources.
SynSemClass4.0 is a multilingual event-type ontology based on classes of synonymous verb senses, complemented with semantic roles and links to existing semantic lexicons.
The SynSemClass is not only enriched by an additional number of classes but in the context of content hierarchy, some classes have been merged.
Compared to the older version of the lexicon, the novelty is the definitions of classes and the definitions of roles.
Apart from the already used links to PDT-Vallex, EngVallex, CzEngVallex, FrameNet, VerbNet, PropBank, Ontonotes, and English WordNet for Czech and English entries the new links to German language lexical resources are exploited for German verb entries, such as Woxikon, E-VALBU, and GUP.
The German part of the lexicon has been created within the project Multilingual Event-Type-Anchored Ontology for Natural Language Understanding (META-O-NLU) by two cooperating teams - the team of the Charles University, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Prague (ÚFAL), Czech Republic and the team of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) Speech and Language Technology, Berlin, Germany.
We present an extension of the SynSemClass event-type ontology, originally conceived as a bilingual Czech-English resource.
We added German entries to the classes representing the concepts of the ontology.
Having a different starting point than the original work (unannotated parallel corpus without links to a valency lexicon and, of course, different existing lexical resources), it was a challenge to adapt the annotation guidelines, the data model and the tools used for the original version.
We describe the process and results of working in such a setup.
We also show the next steps to adapt the annotation process, data structures and formats and tools necessary to make the addition of a new language in the future more smooth and efficient, and possibly to allow for various teams to work on SynSemClass extensions to many languages concurrently.
We also present the latest release which contains the results of adding German, freely available for download as well as for online access.
We present NomVallex, a manually annotated valency lexicon of Czech nouns and adjectives.
The lexicon is created in the theoretical
framework of the Functional Generative Description and based on corpus data.
In total, NomVallex 2.0 is comprised of 1027 lexical
units contained in 570 lexemes, covering the following part-of-speech and derivational categories: deverbal and deadjectival nouns,
and deverbal, denominal, deadjectival and primary adjectives.
Valency properties of a lexical unit are captured in a valency frame
which is modeled as a sequence of valency slots, supplemented with a list of morphemic forms.
In order to make it possible to study
the relationship between valency behavior of base words and their derivatives, lexical units of nouns and adjectives in NomVallex are
linked to their respective base words, contained either in NomVallex itself or, in case of verbs, in a valency lexicon of Czech verbs
called VALLEX.
NomVallex enables a comparison of valency properties of a significant number of Czech nominals with their base
words, both manually and in an automatic way; as such, we can address the theoretical question of argument inheritance, concentrating
on systemic and non-systemic valency behavior.
Universal Dependencies is an international community project and a collection of morphosyntactically annotated data sets (“treebanks”) for more than 100 languages.
The collection is an invaluable resource for various linguistic studies, ranging from grammatical constructions within one language to language typology, documentation of endangered languages, and historical evolution of language.
In the tutorial, I will first quickly show the main principles of UD, then I will present the actual data and various tools that are available to work with it: parsers, batch processors, search engines and viewers.
This paper focuses on detection of sources in the Czech articles published on a news server of Czech public radio.
In particular, we search for attribution in sentences and we recognize attributed sources and their sentence context (signals).
We organized a crowdsourcing annotation task that resulted in a data set of 2,167 stories with manually recognized signals and sources.
In addition, the sources were classified into the classes of named and unnamed sources.
Input data, individual experimental annotations, and a complete and detailed overview of the measured results related to the experiment dealing with the influence of automatic pre-annotation on the quality and efficiency of manual annotation efforts.
This paper presents an analysis of annotation using an automatic pre-annotation for a mid-level annotation complexity task - dependency syntax annotation.
It compares the annotation efforts made by annotators using a pre-annotated version (with a high-accuracy parser) and those made by fully manual annotation.
The aim of the experiment is to judge the final annotation quality when pre-annotation is used.
In addition, it evaluates the effect of automatic linguistically-based (rule-formulated) checks and another annotation on the same data available to the annotators, and their influence on annotation quality and efficiency.
The experiment confirmed that the pre-annotation is an efficient tool for faster manual syntactic annotation which increases the consistency of the resulting annotation without reducing its quality.
The study deals with Czech conversion pairs of a noun and a verb, both of which denote actions (test ‘test.n’ – testovat ‘to test’).
Elaborating on previous research on prototypical verb-to-noun and noun-to-verb conversion in Czech, the direction in these pairs is determined based on whether the verb forms its aspectual counterpart by changing the theme (which is characteristic of the deverbal direction), or whether the suffixed counterpart is not available (typical of denominal verbs).
The analysis, carried out on a corpus sample of 1,300 action nouns and directly related verbs, demonstrates that pairs with native roots mostly conform to the deverbal pattern, whereas the denominal direction applies to a smaller subset of the native sample but clearly prevails in the data with foreign roots.
The denominal direction ascribed to foreign pairs is consistent with the typological hypothesis that verbs are borrowed rather as nouns and subsequently turned into verbs in the target language.
The study deals with English noun/verb conversion pairs that have both formally and semantically close counterpart pairs in Czech.
The study’s aim is to examine how these nouns and verbs, linked with similar semantic relations in English and Czech, are accommodated in the two languages with different morphological structures and conversion playing a different role.
The noun/verb pairs, extracted from the British National Corpus and from the SYN2000 corpus, are analysed as two-cell paradigms and examined along with selected derivatives.
The data suggest that in the Czech sample, nominals are preferred over verbs in expressing the particular meanings and most verbs appear as denominal formations, often differently from their English counterparts.
This paper presents the ParlaMint corpora containing transcriptions of the sessions of the 17 European national parliaments with half a billion words.
The corpora are uniformly encoded, contain rich meta-data about 11 thousand speakers, and are linguistically annotated following the Universal Dependencies formalism and with named entities.
Samples of the corpora and conversion scripts are available from the project’s GitHub repository, and the complete corpora are openly available via the CLARIN.SI repository for download, as well as through the NoSketch Engine and KonText concordancers and the Parlameter interface for on-line exploration and analysis.
This paper is framed in the context of the SSHOC project and aims at exploring how Language Technologies can help in promoting and facilitating multilingualism in the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH).
Although most SSH researchers produce culturally and societally relevant work in their local languages, metadata and vocabularies used in the SSH domain to describe and index research data are currently mostly in English.
We thus investigate Natural Language Processing and Machine Translation approaches in view of providing resources and tools to foster multilingual access and discovery to SSH content across different languages.
As case studies, we create and deliver as freely, openly available data a set of multilingual metadata concepts and an automatically extracted multilingual Data Stewardship terminology.
The two case studies allow as well to evaluate performances of state-of-the-art tools and to derive a set of recommendations as to how best apply them.
Although not adapted to the specific domain, the employed tools prove to be a valid asset to translation tasks.
Nonetheless, validation of results by domain experts proficient in the language is an unavoidable phase of the whole workflow.

Presentation of interactive theatre script generation for employees of the Novartis company.
We experiment with adapting generative language models for the generation of long coherent narratives in the form of theatre plays.
Since fully automatic generation of whole plays is not currently feasible, we created an interactive tool that allows a human user to steer the generation somewhat while minimizing intervention.
We pursue two approaches to long-text generation: a flat generation with summarization of context, and a hierarchical text-to-text two-stage approach, where a synopsis is generated first and then used to condition generation of the final script.
Our preliminary results and discussions with theatre professionals show improvements over vanilla language model generation, but also identify important limitations of our approach.
We present a free online demo of THEaiTRobot, an open-source bilingual tool for interactively generating theatre play scripts, in two versions.
THEaiTRobot 1.0 uses the GPT-2 language model with minimal adjustments.
THEaiTRobot 2.0 uses two models created by fine-tuning GPT-2 on purposefully collected and processed datasets and several other components, generating play scripts in a hierarchical fashion (title → synopsis → script).
The underlying tool is used in the THEaiTRE project to generate scripts for plays, which are then performed on stage by a professional theatre.
We introduce a large and diverse Czech corpus annotated for grammatical error correction (GEC) with the aim to contribute to the still scarce data resources in this domain for languages other than English.
The Grammar Error Correction Corpus for Czech (GECCC) offers a variety of four domains, covering error distributions ranging from high error density essays written by non-native speakers, to website texts, where errors are expected to be much less common.
We compare several Czech GEC systems, including several Transformer-based ones, setting a strong baseline to future research.
Finally, we meta-evaluate common GEC metrics against human judgements on our data.
We make the new Czech GEC corpus publicly available under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license at http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-4639.
In ParlaMint I, a CLARIN-ERIC supported project in pandemic times, a set of comparable and uniformly annotated multilingual corpora for 17 national parliaments were developed and released in 2021.
For 2022 and 2023, the project has been extended to ParlaMint II, again with the CLARIN ERIC financial support, in order to enhance the existing corpora with new data and metadata; upgrade the XML schema; add corpora for 10 new parliaments; provide more application scenarios and carry out additional experiments.
The paper reports on these planned steps, including some that have already been taken, and outlines future plans.
In most Vision-Language models (VL), the understanding of the image structure is enabled by injecting the position information (PI) about objects in the image.
In our case study of LXMERT, a state-of-the-art VL model, we probe the use of the PI in the representation and study its effect on Visual Question Answering.
We show that the model is not capable of leveraging the PI for the image-text matching task on a challenge set where only position differs.
Yet, our experiments with probing confirm that the PI is indeed present in the representation.
We introduce two strategies to tackle this: (i) Positional Information Pre-training and (ii) Contrastive Learning on PI using Cross-Modality Matching.
Doing so, the model can correctly classify if images with detailed PI statements match.
Additionally to the 2D information from bounding boxes, we introduce the object’s depth as new feature for a better object localization in the space.
Even though we were able to improve the model properties as defined by our probes, it only has a negligible effect on the downstream performance.
Our results thus highlight an important issue of multimodal modeling: the mere presence of information detectable by a probing classifier is not a guarantee that the information is available in a cross-modal setup.
In this paper, we describe our submission to the Simultaneous Speech Translation at IWSLT 2022.
We explore strategies to utilize an offline model in a simultaneous setting without the need to modify the  riginal model.
In our experiments, we show that our onlinization algorithm is almost on par with the offline setting while being 3×  faster than offline in terms of latency on the test set.
We make our system publicly available.
Meeting summarization is primarily focused on topi cal coverage rather than on fluency or coherence.
It is a challenging and tedious task, even when meeting summaries are created manually.
The resulting sum maries vary in the goals, style, and they are inevitably very subjective due to the human in the loop.
Also, the awareness of the context of the meeting is essential to create adequate and informative summaries.
The work deals with the paradigmatic system of Czech inflexion from the perspective of distributional semantics.
We use extensive morphological and corpus resources available for Czech to obtain models of the Czech distributional vector space and examine the behaviour of selected morphosyntactic features of Czech nouns and adjectives.
The presentation summarises the work of our START grant team on the topic of competition in word formation.
It presents language resources as well as the methodology used in the mentioned research area.
The work deals with the borderline between inflexion and derivation in Czech, especially from the perspective of distributional semantics.
We use extensive morphological and corpus resources available for Czech to obtain models of the Czech distributional vector space and examine a collection of 24 types of morphological contrasts exemplifying canonical inflexion, canonical derivation, and different types of intermediate cases.
We present Eyetracked Multi-Modal Translation (EMMT), a dataset containing monocular eye movement recordings, audio data and 4-electrode wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 43 participants while engaged in sight translation task supported by an image.
Eye-Tracking data is a very useful source of information to study cognition and especially language comprehension in humans.
In this paper, we describe our systems for the CMCL 2022 shared task on predicting eye-tracking information.
We describe our experiments with pretrained models like BERT and XLM and the different ways in which we used those representations to predict four eye-tracking features.
Along with analysing the effect of using two different kinds of pretrained multilingual language models and different ways of pooling the tokenlevel representations, we also explore how contextual information affects the performance of the systems.
Finally, we also explore if factors like augmenting linguistic information affect the predictions.
Our submissions achieved an average MAE of 5.72 and ranked 5th in the shared task.
The average MAE showed further reduction to 5.25 in post task evaluation.
In the Shannon game, the goal is to guess the next letter in a sentence based on the previous context.
It has since become a widely known thought experiment on which concepts in psycholinguistics, computational linguistics and natural language processing are based.
We extend this game by including an optional extra modality in the form of images and run an experiment on human participants.
We find that the presence of an image greatly improves users' confidence and accuracy accross all POS.
This includes determiners (a, an, the), which should otherwise be predicted solely from the previous (left) context of the sentence.
It is unclear whether, how and where large pre-trained language models capture subtle linguistic traits like ambiguity, grammaticality and sentence complexity.
We present results of automatic classification of these traits and compare their viability and patterns across representation types.
We demonstrate that template-based datasets with surface-level artifacts should not be used for probing,
careful comparisons with baselines should be done
and that t-SNE plots should not be used to determine the presence of a feature among dense vectors representations.
We also demonstrate how features might be highly localized in the layers for these models and get lost in the upper layers.
In data-to-text (D2T) generation, training on in-domain data leads to overfitting to the data representation and repeating training data noise.
We examine how to avoid finetuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on D2T generation datasets while still taking advantage of surface realization capabilities of PLMs.
Inspired by pipeline approaches, we propose to generate text by transforming single-item descriptions with a sequence of modules trained on general-domain text-based operations: ordering, aggregation, and paragraph compression.
We train PLMs for performing these operations on a synthetic corpus WikiFluent which we build from English Wikipedia.
Our experiments on two major triple-to-text datasets — WebNLG and E2E — show that our approach enables D2T generation from RDF triples in zero-shot settings.
Efficient machine translation models are commercially important as they can increase inference speeds, and reduce costs and carbon emissions.
Recently, there has been much interest in non-autoregressive (NAR) models, which promise faster translation.
In parallel to the research on NAR models, there have been successful attempts to create optimized autoregressive models as part of the WMT shared task on efficient translation.
In this paper, we point out flaws in the evaluation methodology present in the literature on NAR models and we provide a fair comparison between a state-of-the-art NAR model and the autoregressive submissions to the shared task.
We make the case for consistent evaluation of NAR models, and also for the importance of comparing NAR models with other widely used methods for improving efficiency.
We run experiments with a connectionist-temporal-classification-based (CTC) NAR model implemented in C++ and compare it with AR models using wall clock times.
Our results show that, although NAR models are faster on  GPUs, with small batch sizes, they are almost always slower under more realistic usage conditions.
We call for more realistic and extensive evaluation of NAR models in future work.
The success of deep learning NLP is often narrated as not assuming anything about the language and letting the data speak for itself.
Although this is debatable on many levels, one thing is outstandingly suspicious: most state-of-the-art NLP models assume the existence of discrete tokens and use subword segmentation which combines rules with simple statistical heuristics.
Avoiding explicit input segmentations is more difficult than it seems.
The first part of the talk will present neural edit distance, a novel interpretable architecture based on well-known Levenshtein distance that can be used for purely character-level tasks such as transliteration or cognate detection.
In the second part of the talk, we will zoom out and have a look at character-level methods for neural machine translation.
We will present how innovations in training and architectures design can improve translation quality.
Despite this progress, we will show that character-level methods in machine translation still lack behind the subword-based models nearly in all respect that can be measured.
We propose the neural string edit distance model for string-pair matching and string transduction based on learnable string edit distance.
We modify the original expectation-maximization learned edit distance algorithm into a differentiable loss function, allowing us to integrate it into a neural network providing a contextual representation of the input.
We evaluate on cognate detection, transliteration, and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, and show that we can trade off between performance and interpretability in a single framework.
Using contextual representations, which are difficult to interpret, we match the performance of state-of-the-art string-pair matching models.
Using static embeddings and a slightly different loss function, we force interpretability, at the expense of an accuracy drop.
We present a literature and empirical survey that critically assesses the state of the art in character-level modeling for machine translation (MT).
Despite evidence in the literature that character-level systems are comparable with subword systems, they are virtually never used in competitive setups in WMT competitions.
We empirically show that even with recent modeling innovations in character-level natural language processing, character-level MT systems still struggle to match their subword-based counterparts.
Character-level MT systems show neither better domain robustness, nor better morphological generalization, despite being often so motivated.
However, we are able to show robustness towards source side noise and that translation quality does not degrade with increasing beam size at decoding time.
Finding the lineage of a research topic is crucial for understanding the prior state of the art and advancing scientific displacement.
The deluge of scholarly articles makes it difficult to locate the most relevant previous work.
It causes researchers to spend a considerable amount of time building up their literature list.
Citations play a crucial role in discovering relevant literature.
However, not all citations are created equal.
The majority of the citations that a paper receives provide contextual and background information to the citing papers.
In those cases, the cited paper is not central to the theme of citing papers.
However, some papers build upon a given paper, further the research frontier.
In those cases, the concerned cited paper plays a pivotal role in the citing paper.
Hence, the nature of citation the former receives from the latter is significant.
In this work, we discuss our investigations towards discovering significant citations of a given paper.
We further show how we can leverage significant citations to build a research lineage via a significant citation graph.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our idea with two real-life case studies.
Our experiments yield promising results with respect to the current state-of-the-art in classifying significant citations, outperforming the earlier ones by a relative margin of 20 points in terms of precision.
We hypothesize that such an automated system can facilitate relevant literature discovery and help identify knowledge flow for a particular category of papers.

The SummDial special session on summarization of dialogues and multi-party meetings was held virtually within the SIGDial 2021 conference on July 29, 2021.
SummDial @ SIGDial 2021 aimed to bring together the speech, dialogue, and summarization communities to foster cross-pollination of ideas and fuel the discussions/collaborations to attempt this crucial and timely problem.
When the pandemic has restricted most of our in-person interactions, the current scenario has forced people to go virtual, resulting in an information overload from frequent dialogues and meetings in the virtual environment.
Summarization could help reduce the cognitive burden on the participants; however, multi-party speech summarization comes with its own set of challenges.
The SummDial special session aimed to leverage the community intelligence to find effective solutions while also brainstorming the future of AI interventions in meetings and dialogues.
We report the findings of the special session in this article.
We organized the SummDial special session under the aegis of the EU-funded H2020 European Live Translator (ELITR) project.
The deliverable presents three detailed case studies for each of the main topical areas of SSHOC Task 3.1 “Multilingual Terminologies'' aiming to investigate NLP and MT approaches  in  view  of  providing resources  and  tools  to  foster  multilingual  access  to  SSH  content  across  different  languages  and improve  discovery  by  non-native  speakers.
A  set  of  multilingual  metadata  concepts,  multilingual vocabularies  and  automatically  extracted  multilingual  terminologies  has  been  delivered  as  freely, openly available data, fully corresponding to the FAIR  principles promoted within the EOSC, findable through the VLO and other CLARIN and SSHOC services.
Handwritten music recognition is a challenging task that could be of great use if mastered, e.g., to improve the accessibility of archival manuscripts or to ease music composition.
Many modern machine learning techniques, however, cannot be easily applied to this task because of the limited availability of high-quality training data.
Annotating such data manually is expensive and thus not feasible at the necessary scale.
This problem has already been tackled in other fields by training on automatically generated synthetic data.
We bring this approach to handwritten music recognition and present a method to generate synthetic handwritten music images (limited to monophonic scores) and
show that training on such data leads to state-of-the-art results.
The recent explosion in false information on social
media has led to intensive research on automatic fake news detection models and fact-checkers.
Fake news and misinformation,
due to its peculiarity and rapid dissemination, have posed many
interesting challenges to the Natural Language Processing (NLP)
and Machine Learning (ML) community.
Admissible literature
shows that novel information includes the element of surprise,
which is the principal characteristic for the amplification and
virality of misinformation.
Novel and emotional information
attracts immediate attention in the reader.
Emotion is the
presentation of a certain feeling or sentiment.
Sentiment helps
an individual to convey his emotion through expression and
hence the two are co-related.
Thus, Novelty of the news item
and thereafter detecting the Emotional state and Sentiment of
the reader appear to be three key ingredients, tightly coupled
with misinformation.
In this paper we propose a deep multitask
learning model that jointly performs novelty detection, emotion
recognition, sentiment prediction, and misinformation detection.
Our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance for fake news detection on three benchmark datasets,
viz.
ByteDance, Fake News Challenge(FNC), and Covid-Stance
with 11.55%, 1.58%, and 21.76% improvement in accuracy,
respectively.
The proposed approach also shows the efficacy over
the single-task framework with an accuracy gain of 11.53, 28.62,
and 14.31 percentage points for the above three datasets.

Fake news or misinformation is the information or stories intentionally created to deceive or mislead the readers.
Nowadays, social media platforms have become the ripe grounds for misinformation, spreading them in a few minutes, which led to chaos, panic, and potential health hazards among people.
The rapid dissemination and a prolific rise in the spread of fake news and misinformation create the most time-critical challenges for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community.
Relevant literature reveals that the presence of an element of surprise in the story is a strong driving force for the rapid dissemination of misinformation, which attracts immediate attention and invokes strong emotional stimulus in the reader.
False stories or fake information are written to arouse interest and activate the emotions of people to spread it.
Thus, false stories have a higher level of novelty and emotional content than true stories.
Hence, Novelty of the news item and recognizing the Emotional state of the reader after reading the item seems two key tasks to tightly couple with misinformation Detection.
Previous literature did not explore misinformation detection with mutual learning for novelty detection and emotion recognition to the best of our knowledge.
Our current work argues that joint learning of novelty and emotion from the target text makes a strong case for misinformation detection.
In this paper, we propose a deep multitask learning framework that jointly performs novelty detection, emotion recognition, and misinformation detection.
Our deep multitask model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for fake news detection on four benchmark datasets, viz.
ByteDance, FNC, Covid-Stance and FNID with 7.73%, 3.69%, 7.95% and 13.38% accuracy gain, respectively.
The evaluation shows that our multitask learning framework improves the performance over the single-task framework for four datasets with 7.8%, 28.62%, 11.46%, and 15.66% overall accuracy gain.
We claim that textual novelty and emotion are the two key aspects to consider while developing an automatic fake news detection mechanism.
The source code is available at https://github.com/Nish-19/Misinformation-Multitask-Attention-NE.
One of the most time-critical challenges for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community is to combat the spread of fake news and misinformation.
Existing approaches for misinformation detection use neural network models, statistical methods, linguistic traits, fact-checking strategies, etc.
However, the menace of fake news seems to grow more vigorous with the advent of humongous and unusually creative language models.
Relevant literature reveals that one major characteristic of the virality of fake news is the presence of an element of surprise in the story, which attracts immediate attention and invokes strong emotional stimulus in the reader.
In this work, we leverage this idea and propose textual novelty detection and emotion prediction as the two tasks relating to automatic misinformation detection.
We re-purpose textual entailment for novelty detection and use the models trained on large-scale datasets of entailment and emotion to classify fake information.
Our results correlate with the idea as we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance (7.92%, 1.54%, 17.31% and 8.13% improvement in terms of accuracy) on four large-scale misinformation datasets.
We hope that our current probe will motivate the community to explore further research on misinformation detection along this line.

We present AggGen (pronounced ‘again’) a data-to-text model which re-introduces two explicit sentence planning stages into neural data-to-text systems: input ordering and input aggregation.
In contrast to previous work using sentence planning, our model is still end-to-end: AggGen performs sentence planning at the same time as generating text by learning latent alignments (via semantic facts) between input representation and target text.
Experiments on the WebNLG and E2E challenge data show that by using fact-based alignments our approach is more interpretable, expressive, robust to noise, and easier to control, while retaining the advantages of end-to-end systems in terms of fluency.
Our code is available at https://github.com/XinnuoXu/AggGen.
In this work, we describe our system submission to the SemEval 2021 Task 11: NLP Contribution Graph Challenge.
We attempt all the three sub-tasks in the challenge and report our results.
Subtask 1 aims to identify the contributing sentences in a given publication.
Subtask 2 follows from Subtask 1 to extract the scientific term and predicate phrases from the identified contributing sentences.
The final Subtask 3 entails extracting triples (subject, predicate, object) from the phrases and categorizing them under one or more defined information units.
With the NLPContributionGraph Shared Task, the organizers formalized the building of a scholarly contributions-focused graph over NLP scholarly articles as an automated task.
Our approaches include a BERT-based classification model for identifying the contributing sentences in a research publication, a rule-based dependency parsing for phrase extraction, followed by a CNN-based model for information units classification, and a set of rules for triples extraction.
The quantitative results show that we obtain the 5th, 5th, and 7th rank respectively in three evaluation phases.
We make our codes available at https://github.com/HardikArora17/SemEval-2021-INNOVATORS.
This paper provides the description of
shared tasks to the WAT 2021 by our
team “NLPHut”.
We have participated
in the English→Hindi Multimodal translation task, English→Malayalam Multimodal translation task, and Indic Multilingual translation task.
We have used
the state-of-the-art Transformer model
with language tags in different settings
for the translation task and proposed a
novel “region-specific” caption generation
approach using a combination of image
CNN and LSTM for the Hindi and Malayalam image captioning.
Our submission
tops in English→Malayalam Multimodal
translation task (text-only translation, and
Malayalam caption), and ranks secondbest in English→Hindi Multimodal translation task (text-only translation, and Hindi
caption).
Our submissions have also performed well in the Indic Multilingual translation tasks.
This paper provides a quick overview of possible methods how to detect that reference translations were actually created by post-editing
an MT system.
Two methods based on automatic metrics are presented: BLEU difference
between the suspected MT and some other
good MT and BLEU difference using additional references.
These two methods revealed
a suspicion that the WMT 2020 Czech reference is based on MT.
The suspicion was confirmed in a manual analysis by finding concrete proofs of the post-editing procedure in
particular sentences.
Finally, a typology of
post-editing changes is presented where typical errors or changes made by the post-editor
or errors adopted from the MT are classified.
We present the winning entry to the Multilingual Lexical Normalization (MultiLexNorm) shared task at W-NUT 2021 (van der Goot et al., 2021a), which evaluates lexical-normalization systems on 12 social media datasets in 11 languages.
We base our solution on a pre-trained byte-level language model, ByT5 (Xue et al., 2021a), which we further pre-train on synthetic data and then fine-tune on authentic normalization data.
Our system achieves the best performance by a wide margin in intrinsic evaluation, and also the best performance in extrinsic evaluation through dependency parsing.
The source code is released at https://github.com/ufal/multilexnorm2021 and the fine-tuned models at https://huggingface.co/ufal.
Subject-Article classification is an important problem in
Scholarly Document Processing to address the huge information overload in the scholarly space.
This paper describes the
approach of our team CUNI-NU for the Biocreative VII-Track
5 challenge: Litcovid multi-label topic classification for
COVID-19 literature [1].
The concerned task aims to automate
the manual curation of biomedical articles into seven distinct
labels, specifically for the LitCovid data repository.
Our best
performing model makes use of the SPECTER [2] document
embeddings for representing abstract, and titles of scientific
articles followed by a Dual-Attention [3] mechanism to perform the multi-label categorization.
We achieve significantly
better performance than the baseline methods.

We have fitted four classic readability metrics to Czech, using InterCorp (a parallel corpus with manual sentence alignment), CzEng 2.0 (a large parallel corpus of crawled web texts),  and the optimize.curve fit algorithm from the SciPy library.
The adapted metrics are: Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Coleman-Liau Index, and Automated Readability Index.
We describe the details of the procedure and present satisfactory results.
Besides, we discuss the sensitivity of these metrics to text paraphrases and correlation of readability scores with empirically observed reading comprehension, as well as the adaptation of Flesch Reading Ease to Czech from Russian.
While neural-network-based approaches have significantly increased the fluency of machine-generated text, they are prone to accuracy errors, such as leaving out parts of the input (omissions) or generating output that is not grounded in any input (hallucination).
This problem becomes especially apparent with lower amounts of training data, generation of longer texts, and noise in the training data.
All of these conditions are very common for natural language generation (NLG) tasks.
In this talk, I will show several example approaches aiming to produce more accurate outputs within an NLG system, or to detect errors in an NLG system output.
I will specifically focus on sequence-to-sequence neural architectures with pretrained language models and their
extensions.
I will mostly discuss generation of text from structured data, but I will also make comparisons to the situation in summarization or dialogue response generation.
Over the past decades an increasing number of performing artists and technologists have brought robots to the center stage in their performances.
AI has taken roles such as comedy improvisers, storytellers, actors, dancers, and choreographers, disrupting the traditional two-way human actor-human audience interaction.
By presenting this talk we try to challenge the idea that live performance is a specifically human activity and explore different forms of human-AI interactions in the theatre.
What story does AI tell?
What emotions can it generate?
Do you think artificial intelligence is able to create an enjoyable theatre script?
Can a robot become a playwright?
Does the perfect theater evening exist, produced by an autonomous machine?
The 6th edition of the Search-Oriented Conversational AI workshop (SCAI 2021) was organised as a discussion platform on conversational AI for intelligent information access.
The workshop was designed to be multidisciplinary, bringing together researchers and practitioners across the fields of natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), machine learning (ML) and human-computer interaction (HCI).
The workshop included four sessions featuring invited talks, a separate poster session, and a session discussing the results of a shared task on conversational question answering (SCAI-QReCC).
We present experiments on automatically detecting inconsistent behavior of task-oriented dialogue systems from the context.
We enrich the bAbI/DSTC2 data (Bordes et al., 2017) with automatic annotation of dialogue inconsistencies, and we demonstrate that inconsistencies correlate with failed dialogues.
We hypothesize that using a limited dialogue history and predicting the next user turn can improve inconsistency classiﬁcation.
While both hypotheses are conﬁrmed for a memory-networks-based dialogue model, it does not hold for a training based on the GPT-2 language model, which benefits most from using full dialogue history and achieves a 0.99 accuracy score.
Attention-based pre-trained language models such as GPT-2 brought considerable progress to end-to-end dialogue modelling.
However, they also present considerable risks for task-oriented dialogue, such as lack of knowledge grounding or diversity.
To address these issues, we introduce modified training objectives for language model finetuning, and we employ massive data augmentation via back-translation to increase the diversity of the training data.
We further examine the possibilities of combining data from multiples sources to improve performance on the target dataset.
We carefully evaluate our contributions with both human and automatic methods.
Our model substantially outperforms the baseline on the MultiWOZ data and shows competitive performance with state of the art in both automatic and human evaluation.

Our book "The Reality of Multi-Lingual Machine Translation" discusses the benefits and perils of using more than two languages in machine translation systems.
While focused on the particular task of sequence-to-sequence processing and multi-task learning, the book targets somewhat beyond the area of natural language processing.
Machine translation is for us a prime example of deep learning applications where human skills and learning capabilities are taken as a benchmark that many try to match and surpass.
We document that some of the gains observed in multi-lingual translation may result from simpler effects than the assumed cross-lingual transfer of knowledge.
In the first, rather general part, the book will lead you through the motivation for multi-linguality, the versatility of deep neural networks especially in sequence-to-sequence tasks to complications of this learning.
We conclude the general part with warnings against too optimistic and unjustified explanations of the gains that neural networks demonstrate.
In the second part, we fully delve into multi-lingual models, with a particularly careful examination of transfer learning as one of the more straightforward approaches utilizing additional languages.
The recent multi-lingual techniques, including massive models, are surveyed and practical aspects of deploying systems for many languages are discussed.
The conclusion highlights the open problem of machine understanding and reminds of two ethical aspects of building large-scale models: the inclusivity of research and its ecological trace.
In the media industry, the focus of global reporting can shift overnight.
There is a compelling
need to be able to develop new machine translation systems in a short period of time, in order to more efficiently cover quickly developing stories.
As part of the low-resource machine
translation project GoURMET, we selected a surprise language for which a system had to be
built and evaluated in two months (February and March 2021).
The language selected was
Pashto, an Indo-Iranian language spoken in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.
In this period we
completed the full pipeline of development of a neural machine translation system: data crawling, cleaning, aligning, creating test sets, developing and testing models, and delivering them
to the user partners.
In this paper we describe the rapid data creation process, and experiments
with transfer learning and pretraining for Pashto-English.
We find that starting from an existing
large model pre-trained on 50 languages leads to far better BLEU scores than pretraining on
one high-resource language pair with a smaller model.
We also present human evaluation of
our systems, which indicates that the resulting systems perform better than a freely available
commercial system when translating from English into Pashto direction, and similarly when
translating from Pashto into English.
In this paper we describe how the TEITOK corpus platform was integrated with the KonText and PML-TQ corpus platforms at LINDAT to provide document visualization for both existing and future resources at LINDAT.
TEITOK is an online platform for searching, viewing, and editing corpora, where corpus files are stored as annotated TEI/XML files.
The TEITOK integration also means LINDAT resources will become available in TEI/XML format, and searchable in CWB on top of existing tools at the institute.
Although the integration described in this paper is specific for LINDAT, the method should be applicable to the integration of TEITOK or similar tools into an existing corpus architecture.
Deep Universal Dependencies is a collection of treebanks derived semi-automatically from Universal Dependencies.
It contains additional deep-syntactic and semantic annotations.
Version of Deep UD corresponds to the version of UD it is based on.
Note however that some UD treebanks have been omitted from Deep UD.
We introduce GEM, a living benchmark for natural language Generation (NLG), its Evaluation, and Metrics.
Measuring progress in NLG relies on a constantly evolving ecosystem of automated metrics, datasets, and human evaluation standards.
Due to this moving target, new models often still evaluate on divergent anglo-centric corpora with well-established, but flawed, metrics.
This disconnect makes it challenging to identify the limitations of current models and opportunities for progress.
Addressing this limitation, GEM provides an environment in which models can easily be applied to a wide set of tasks and in which evaluation strategies can be tested.
Regular updates to the benchmark will help NLG research become more multilingual and evolve the challenge alongside models.
This paper serves as the description of the data for the 2021 shared task at the associated GEM Workshop.
In this article, we present a proof-of-concept method for creating word-formation networks by transferring information from another language.
The proposed algorithm utilizes an existing word-formation network and parallel texts and creates a low-precision and moderate-recall network in a language, for which no manual annotations need to be available.
We then extend the coverage of the resulting network by using it to train a machine-learning method and applying the resulting model to a larger lexicon, obtaining a moderate-precision and high-recall result.
The approach is evaluated on French, German and Czech against existing word-formation networks in those languages.
We present pilot experiments on splitting and identifying Czech compound words.
We created
an algorithm measuring the linguistic similarity of two words based on finding the shortest
path through a matrix of mutual estimated correspondences between two phonemic strings.
Additionally, a neural compound-splitting tool (Czech Compound Splitter) was implemented
by using the Marian Neural Machine Translator framework, which was trained on a data set
containing 1,164 hand-annotated compounds and about 280,000 synthetically created compounds.
In compound splitting, the first solution achieved an accuracy of 28% and the second solution
achieved 54% on a separate validation data set.
In compound identification, the Czech Compound
Splitter achieved an accuracy of 91%.
Language  domains  that  require  very  carefuluse of terminology are abundant and reflect asignificant part of the translation industry.
Inthis work we introduce a benchmark for eval-uating the quality and consistency of terminol-ogy translation, focusing on the medical (andCOVID-19  specifically)  domain  for  five  lan-guage pairs:  English to French, Chinese, Rus-sian,  and  Korean,  as  well  as  Czech  to  Ger-man.
We  report  the  descriptions  and  resultsof  the  participating  systems,  commenting  onthe  need  for  further  research  efforts  towardsboth more adequate handling of terminologiesas  well  as  towards  a  proper  formulation  andevaluation of the task.
We describe a pilot experiment aimed at harmonizing diverse data resources that contain coreference-related annotations.
We converted 17 existing datasets for 11 languages into a common annotation scheme based on Universal Dependencies, and released a subset of the resulting collection publicly under the name CorefUD 0.1 via the LINDAT-CLARIAH-CZ repository (http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3510).
CorefUD is a collection of previously existing datasets annotated with coreference, which we converted into a common annotation scheme.
In total, CorefUD in its current version 0.1 consists of 17 datasets for 11 languages.
CorefUD is a collection of previously existing datasets annotated with coreference, which we converted into a common annotation scheme.
In total, CorefUD in its current version 0.2 consists of 17 datasets for 11 languages, and compared to the version 0.1, the automatic morpho-syntactic annotation has improved.
We present an empirical study that compares mention heads as annotated manually in four coreference datasets (for Dutch, English, Polish, and Russian) on one hand, with heads induced from dependency trees parsed automatically, on the other hand.
This paper describes our participating system run to the argumentative text understanding shared task for AI Debater at NLPCC 2021 (http://www.fudan-disc.com/sharedtask/AIDebater21/tracks.html).
The tasks are motivated towards developing an autonomous debating system.
We make an initial attempt with Track-3, namely, argument pair extraction from peer review and rebuttal where we extract arguments from peer reviews and their corresponding rebuttals from author responses.
Compared to the multi-task baseline by the organizers, we introduce two significant changes: (i) we use ERNIE 2.0 token embedding, which can better capture lexical, syntactic, and semantic aspects of information in the training data, (ii) we perform double attention learning to capture long-term dependencies.
Our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art results with a relative improvement of 8.81% in terms of F1 score over the baseline model.
We make our code available publicly at https://github.com/guneetsk99/ArgumentMining_SharedTask.
Our team ARGUABLY is one of the third prize-winning teams in Track 3 of the shared task.
Lexically constrained machine translation allows the user to manipulate the output sentence by enforcing the presence or absence of certain words and phrases.
Although current approaches can enforce terms to appear in the translation, they often struggle to make the constraint word form agree with the rest of the generated output.
Our manual analysis shows that 46% of the errors in the output of a baseline constrained model for English to Czech translation are related to agreement.
We investigate mechanisms to allow neural machine translation to infer the correct word inflection given lemmatized constraints.
In particular, we focus on methods based on training
the model with constraints provided as part of the input sequence.
Our experiments on the English-Czech language pair show that this approach improves the translation of constrained
terms in both automatic and manual evaluation
by reducing errors in agreement.
Our approach
thus eliminates inflection errors, without introducing new errors or decreasing the overall
quality of the translation.
Neural networks are the state-of-the-art method of machine learning for many problems in NLP.
Their success in machine translation and other NLP tasks is phenomenal, but their interpretability is challenging.
We want to find out how neural networks represent meaning.
In order to do this, we propose to examine the distribution of meaning in the vector space representation of words in neural networks trained for NLP tasks.
Furthermore, we propose to consider various theories of meaning in the philosophy of language and to find a methodology that would enable us to connect these areas.
The MultiWOZ dataset (Budzianowski et al.,2018) is frequently used for benchmarking context-to-response abilities of task-oriented dialogue systems.
In this work, we identify inconsistencies in data preprocessing and reporting of three corpus-based metrics used on this dataset, i.e., BLEU score and Inform & Success rates.
We point out a few problems of the MultiWOZ benchmark such as unsatisfactory preprocessing, insufficient or under-specified evaluation metrics, or rigid database.
We re-evaluate 7 end-to-end and 6 policy optimization models in as-fair-as-possible setups, and we show that their reported scores cannot be directly compared.
To facilitate comparison of future systems, we release our stand-alone standardized evaluation scripts.
We also give basic recommendations for corpus-based benchmarking in future works.
With the ever-increasing pace of research
and high volume of scholarly communication,
scholars face a daunting task.
Not only must
they keep up with the growing literature in
their own and related fields, scholars increasingly also need to rebut pseudo-science and
disinformation.
These needs have motivated
an increasing focus on computational methods for enhancing search, summarization, and
analysis of scholarly documents.
However, the
various strands of research on scholarly document processing remain fragmented.
To reach
out to the broader NLP and AI/ML community, pool distributed efforts in this area, and
enable shared access to published research, we
held the 2nd Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing (SDP) at NAACL 2021 as a
virtual event (https://sdproc.org/2021/).
The
SDP workshop consisted of a research track,
three invited talks and three Shared Tasks
(LongSumm 2021, SCIVER and 3C).
The program was geared towards NLP, information retrieval, and data mining for scholarly documents, with an emphasis on identifying and
providing solutions to open challenges.
Describing our experience from the coordination of the EU project ELITR for grant applicants.
I presented the research project ELITR and the state of the art in machine translation and speech translation.
A brief description of two applied projects, ELITR and Bergamot, and one basic research project NEUREM3, run at UFAL
This paper presents an automatic speech translation system aimed at live subtitling of conference presentations.
We describe the overall architecture and key processing components.
More importantly, we explain our strategy for building a complex system for end-users from numerous individual components, each of which has been tested only in laboratory conditions.
The system is a working prototype that is routinely tested in recognizing English, Czech, and German speech and presenting it translated simultaneously into 42 target languages.
The paper describes the practical experience from testing our complex system translating from the speech of speakers and interpreters.
This machine translation test set contains 2223 Czech sentences collected within the FAUST project (https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/grants/faust, http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3308).
Each original (noisy) sentence was normalized (clean1 and clean2) and translated to English independently by two translators.

This report presents a guideline for including German synonyms into the multilingual SynSemClass lexicon.
The SynSemClass synonym verb lexicon version 3.5 investigates, with respect to contextually-based verb synonymy, semantic ‘equivalence’ of Czech, English and German verb senses and their valency behavior in parallel Czech-English and German-English language resources.
SynSemClass3.5 is a multilingual event-type ontology based on classes of synonymous verb senses, complemented with semantic roles and links to existing semantic lexicons.
Apart of the already used links to PDT-Vallex, EngVallex, CzEngVallex, FrameNet, VerbNet, PropBank, Ontonotes, and English WordNet for Czech and English entries the new links to German language lexical resources are exploited for German verb entries, such as Woxikon, E-VALBU, and GUP.
The German part of the lexicon has been created within the project Multilingual Event-Type-Anchored Ontology for Natural Language Understanding (META-O-NLU) by two cooperating teams - by the team of the Charles University, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Prague (ÚFAL), Czech Republic and the team of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) Speech and Language Technology, Berlin, Germany.
We present results of an automatic comparison of valency frames of interlinked adjectival and verbal lexical units based on the valency lexicons NomVallex and VALLEX.
We distinguish nine derivational types of deverbal adjectives and examine whether they tend to display systemic valency behavior, or rather the non-systemic one.
The non-systemic valency behavior includes changes in the number of valency complementations and, more dominantly, non-systemic forms of actants, especially a prepositional group.
We present a method for extending coverage of the Lexicon of Czech Discourse Connectives – CzeDLex – using annotation projection.
We take advantage of two language resources: (i) the Penn Discourse Treebank 3.0 as a source of manually annotated discourse relations in English, and (ii) the Prague Czech–English Dependency Treebank 2.0 as a translation of the English texts to Czech and a link between tokens on the two language sides.
Although CzeDLex was originally extracted from a large Czech corpus, the presented method resulted in an addition of a number of new connectives and new types of usages (discourse types) for already present entries in the lexicon.
CzeDLex 1.0 is the first production version of a lexicon of Czech discourse connectives, following three previous  development versions.
The lexicon contains connectives partially automatically extracted from the Prague Discourse Treebank 2.0 (PDiT 2.0) and other resources.
All entries in the lexicon have been manually checked, translated to English and supplemented with additional linguistic information.
We present experiments in predicting a discourse sense for explicit inter-sentential discourse relations in Czech and English, using embedding and deep learning (fine-tuned BERT) to predict the senses, and annotation projection from English to Czech to increase the size of training data for Czech.
We attempt to shed some light on the various ways how languages specify date and time, and on the options we have when trying to annotate them uniformly across Universal Dependencies.
Examples from several language families are discussed, and their annotation is proposed.
Our hope is to eventually make this (or similar) proposal an integral part of the UD annotation guidelines, which would help improve consistency of he UD treebanks.
The current annotations are far from consistent, as can be seen from the survey we provide in appendices to this paper.
Universal Dependencies (UD) is a multilingual collection of corpora featuring morphological and syntactic annotation in a unified style.
We discuss an optional layer of deep-syntactic annotation in UD, called Enhanced Universal Dependencies.
We survey the existing enhanced representation as of release 2.8 and consider two possible future expansions: semi-automatic addition of existing enhancement types to new languages, and addition of new enhancement types.
I present Universal Dependencies, a worldwide community project to design morphological and syntactic annotation guidelines applicable to all the languages of the world.
I discuss automatic parsing models and their use in digital humanities: linguistics, language teaching, documentation of endangered languages, linguistic typology and language change.
Deep Universal Dependencies is a collection of treebanks derived semi-automatically from Universal Dependencies.
It contains additional deep-syntactic and semantic annotations.
Version of Deep UD corresponds to the version of UD it is based on.
Note however that some UD treebanks have been omitted from Deep UD.
We describe the second IWPT task on end-to-end parsing from raw text to Enhanced Universal Dependencies.
We provide details about the evaluation metrics and the datasets used for training and evaluation.
We compare the approaches taken by participating teams and discuss the results of the shared task, also in comparison with the first edition of this task.
The paper presents a discussion about homonymy of Czech nouns with different or varying genders.
The lemmas with this type of homonymy are treated in the new release of the dictionary MorfFlex as separated.
We show that the separation of paradigms according to the gender is not only superfluous, but also clumsy, because it forces to make a choice when it is not necessary.
That’s why we call this type of homonymy “artificial”.
The Handbook of Easy Languages in Europe describes the historical background, the principles and the practices of Easy Language in 21 European countries.
The notion of Easy Language refers to modified forms of standard languages that aim to facilitate reading and comprehension.
EngVallex 2.0 as a slightly updated version of EngVallex.
It is the English counterpart of the PDT-Vallex valency lexicon, using the same view of valency, valency frames and the description of a surface form of verbal arguments.
EngVallex contains links also to PropBank (English predicate-argument lexicon).
The EngVallex lexicon is fully linked to the English side of the PCEDT parallel treebank(s), which is in fact the PTB re-annotated using the Prague Dependency Treebank style of annotation.
The EngVallex is available in an XML format in our repository, and also in a searchable form with examples from the PCEDT.
EngVallex 2.0 is the same dataset as the EngVallex lexicon packaged with the PCEDT 3.0 corpus, but published separately under a more permissive licence, avoiding the need for LDC licence which is tied to PCEDT 3.0 as a whole.
The work deals with the formation of agent nouns in Czech, especially the rivalry among the eight most frequent agent suffixes.
We use machine learning methods to calculate the influence of several different formal-linguistic properties on the resulting suffix selected when an agent noun is coined.
This paper outlines the ParlaMint project from the perspective of its goals, tasks, participants, results and applications potential.
The project produced language corpora from the sessions of the national parliaments of 17 countries, almost half a billion words in total.
The corpora are split into COVID-related subcorpora (from November 2019) and reference corpora (to October 2019).
The corpora are uniformly encoded according to the ParlaMint schema with the same Universal Dependencies linguistic annotations.
Samples of the corpora and conversion scripts are available from the project’s GitHub repository.
The complete corpora are openly available via the CLARIN.SI repository for download, and through the NoSketch Engine and KonText concordancers as well as through the Parlameter interface for exploration and analysis.

This paper investigates the recent advances in parsing the Index Thomisticus Treebank, which encompasses Medieval Latin texts by Thomas Aquinas.
The research focuses on two types of variables.
On the one hand, it examines the impact that a larger dataset has on the results of parsing; on the other hand, performances of new parsers are analysed with respect to less recent tools.
Term of comparison to determine the effective parsing advances are the results in parsing the Index Thomisticus Treebank described in a previous work.
First, the best performing parser among those concerned in that study is tested on a larger dataset than the one originally used.
Then, some parser combinations that were developed in the same study are evaluated as well, assessing that more training data result in more accurate performances.
Finally, to examine the impact that newly available tools have on parsing results, we train, test, and evaluate two neural parsers chosen among those best performing in the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task.
Our experiments reach the highest accuracy rates achieved so far in automatic syntactic parsing of the Index Thomisticus Treebank and of Latin overall.

Hacking the GPT-2 language model
Building a web application
Generating a theatre play script
Performing the play on stage
The THEaiTRobot 1.0 tool allows the user to interactively generate scripts for individual theatre play scenes.
The tool is based on GPT-2 XL generative language model.
We encountered numerous problems when generating the script in this way.
We managed to tackle some of the problems with various adjustments, but some of them remain to be solved in a future version.
THEaiTRobot 1.0 was used to generate the first THEaiTRE play, "AI: When a robot writes a play".
We present the first version of a system for interactive generation of theatre play scripts.
The system is based on a vanilla GPT-2 model with several adjustments, targeting specific issues we encountered in practice.
We also list other issues we encountered but plan to only solve in a future version of the system.
The presented system was used to generate a theatre play script premiered in February 2021.
We inform about AI: When a Robot Writes a Play, a theatre play with a mostly artificially generated script.
We describe the THEaiTRobot 1.0 tool, which was used to generate the script.
We discuss various issues encountered in the process, including those that we solved to some extent as well as those which we plan to solve in a future version of the system.
In February 2021, we staged the first theatre play for which 90% of the script was automatically generated by an artificial intelligence system.
The THEaiTRobot system is based on the GPT-2 language model, created by the OpenAI consortium, complemented with automated translation.
We had to adapt the model in various ways, especially to avoid repetitiveness and forgetting of context, and to stick to a limited set of characters.
As input for the system, we used short starting prompts (scene setting and first few lines of dialogue), prepared by a dramaturge, which were expanded into full scenes by THEaiTRobot.
The script was then post-edited and put on stage.
Reviews mostly noted that AI cannot really write a good play (yet), but acknowledged that the performance was mostly interesting and entertaining to watch.
We faced numerous limitations with our approach.
We could only generate individual scenes independently, with a limited number of characters, and with the character personalities often randomly switching and merging.
Also, the system does not see beyond the text of the script, lacking the understanding of the relation of the script to what is happening on stage.
We are currently working on a new version of the system, which should improve on some of the issues, while also further minimizing the amount of human influence.
It should also incorporate the concept of dramatic situations into the generation process.
The THEaiTRE project is related to other similar attempts, such as the play Lifestyle of the Richard and Family, the musical Beyond the Fence, the short movie Sunspring, or the performances of the Improbotics theatre group, all of which use automatically generated content to some extent.
Our play stands out among these projects by being rather long (60 minutes) while having a very high proportion of automatically generated content (90%).
The panel follows the Czech theater performance “AI: When a Robot Writes a Play”, which was written by the help of an AI system and – narrated by a robot – deals with the quest for belonging in an alienated world.
With the makers of the play and other artists working with AI, we will explore to what extent AI systems can imitate human creativity and what this imitation says about our understanding of art and society.
Beyond the fear of computers replacing humans, we want to discuss what new possibilities AI can offer to art and how artists can think critically and originally about new technologies.
Karel Čapek's R.U.R.
was the first theatrical play written by a human about robots (and humans).
It premiered on 25 January 1921.
A hundred years later, with all the current advances in natural language processing and artificial neural networks, we have turned the idea around in our THEaiTRE project.
On 25 January 2021, we will premiere "AI: When a robot writes a play" ("AI: Když robot píše hru"), a theatre play about humans (and robots) written by our artificial intelligence called THEaiTRobot.
It is made possible by computational linguists joining forces with theatre experts for this unique research project.
What is this project about and how has it been developed?
What challenges have we faced?
What does the AI-generated script look like?
...and do we actually want AI to create art?

Argument mining targets structures in natural language related to interpretation and persuasion which are central to scientific communication.
Most scholarly discourse involves interpreting experimental evidence and attempting to persuade other scientists to adopt the same conclusions.
While various argument mining studies have addressed student essays and news articles, those that target scientific discourse are still scarce.
This paper surveys existing work in argument mining of scholarly discourse, and provides an overview of current models, data, tasks, and applications.
We identify a number of key challenges confronting argument mining in the scientific domain, and suggest some possible solutions and future directions.
We propose a new architecture for diacritics restoration based on contextualized embeddings, namely BERT, and we evaluate it on 12 languages with diacritics.
Furthermore, we conduct a detailed error analysis on Czech, a morphologically rich language with a high level of diacritization.
Notably, we manually annotate all mispredictions, showing that roughly 44% of
them are actually not errors, but either plausible variants (19%), or the system corrections of erroneous data (25%).
Finally, we categorize the real errors in detail.
We release the code at https://github.com/ufal/bert-diacritics-restoration.
Sensitivity of deep-neural models to input noise is known to be a challenging problem.
In NLP, model performance often deteriorates with naturally occurring noise, such as spelling errors.
To mitigate this issue, models may leverage artificially noised data.
However, the amount and type of generated noise has so far been determined arbitrarily.
We therefore propose to model the errors statistically from grammatical-error-correction corpora.
We present a thorough evaluation of several state-of-the-art NLP systems' robustness in multiple languages, with tasks including morpho-syntactic analysis, named entity recognition, neural machine translation, a subset of the GLUE benchmark and reading comprehension.
We also compare two approaches to address the performance drop: a) training the NLP models with noised data generated by our framework; and b) reducing the input noise with external system for natural language correction.
The code is released at https://github.com/ufal/kazitext.
This paper presents the results of the shared
tasks from the 8th workshop on Asian translation (WAT2021).
For the WAT2021, 28 teams
participated in the shared tasks and 24 teams
submitted their translation results for the human evaluation.
We also accepted 5 research
papers.
About 2,100 translation results were
submitted to the automatic evaluation server,
and selected submissions were manually evaluated.
In the debate following the production of AI: When a Robot Writes a Play, the question that was present from the very beginning of the entire THEaiTRE project is discussed, and that is whether AI can write a play.
How do experts from various fields of IT see it?
How do theatre creators who had to deal with the text that AI created from 90% see it?
How does AI work with creativity?
And what other horizons does AI go to besides the field of art?
Automatic evaluation of Machine Translation(MT)  quality  has  been  investigated  over  several  decades.
Spoken  Language  Translation (SLT), especially when simultaneous, needs to consider additional criteria and does not have a standard evaluation procedure and a widely used  toolkit.
To  fill  the  gap,  we  introduce SLTev, an open-source tool for assessing SLT in a comprehensive way.
SLTev reports the quality,  latency,  and  stability  of  an  SLT  candidate output based on the time-stamped transcript  and  reference  translation  into  a  target language.
For quality, we rely on sacreBLEU which provides MT evaluation measures such as chrF or BLEU.
For latency, we propose two new scoring techniques.
For stability, we extend  the  previously  defined  measures  with  a normalized Flicker in our work.
We also propose a new averaging of older measures.
A preliminary version of SLTev was used in the IWSLT  2020 SHARED  TASK.
Moreover, a  growing  collection  of  test  datasets  directly accessible by SLTev are provided for system evaluation comparable across papers.
We present the concept of extending a multilingual verb lexicon
also to include German.
In this lexicon, verbs are grouped by meaning
and by semantic properties (following frame semantics) to form multilingual
classes, linking Czech and English verbs.
Entries are further linked
to external lexical resources like VerbNet and PropBank.
In this paper,
we present our plan also to include German verbs, by experimenting
with word alignments to obtain candidates linked to existing English
entries, and identify possible approaches to obtain semantic role information.
We further identify German-specific lexical resources to link to.
This small-scale pilot study aims to provide a blueprint for extending a
lexical resource with a new language.
THEaiTRE
Is a research project celebrating the 100th year anniversary of the premiere of the theater play R.U.R by author Karel Čapek, in which, the word “robot” was used for the first time in 1921.
To celebrate this 100 years old jubilee Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics  at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University joined together with Švanda Theater in Smíchov and the organizers of Hackathons CEE Hacks to face their robots with a new challenge, not previously seen in its full extent - to make artificial intelligence write a screenplay.
The first phase of the project culminated with the premiere of a theater production AI: When a robot writes a play with the purpose to create a screenplay made up of dialogues generated by artificial intelligence.
The second phase is currently in the making, staged for 2022 when another premier with a more sophisticated linguistic model will be introduced.
This project was funded by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic in cooperation with prg.ai and the Theater Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague.
Rudolf Rosa will talk about the technical background of the project (how artificial intelligence generates a screenplay), David Košťák will talk about the creation of this particular screenplay and Daniel Hrbek will summarize the process of the play´s production.
Citations are crucial to a scientific discourse.
Besides providing additional contexts to research papers, citations act as trackers of the direction of research in a field and as an important measure in understanding the impact of a research publication.
With the rapid growth in research publications, automated solutions for identifying the purpose and influence of citations are becoming very important.
The 3C Citation Context Classification Task organized as part of the Second Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing @ NAACL 2021 is a shared task to address the aforementioned problems.
In this paper, we present our team, IITP-CUNI@3C’s submission to the 3C shared tasks.
For Task A, citation context purpose classification, we propose a neural multi-task learning framework that harnesses the structural information of the research papers and the relation between the citation context and the cited paper for citation classification.
For Task B, citation context influence classification, we use a set of simple features to classify citations based on their perceived significance.
We achieve comparable performance with respect to the best performing systems in Task A and superseded the majority baseline in Task B with very simple features.
With the rapid growth in research publications, automated solutions to tackle scholarly information overload is growing  more  relevant.
Correctly  identifying  the  intent  of  the  citations  is  one  such  task  that  finds  applications  ranging from predicting scholarly impact, finding idea propagation, to text summarization to establishing more informative citation indexers.
In this in-progress work, we leverage the cited paper’s information and demonstrate that this helps in the effective classification of citation intents.
We propose a neural multi-task learning framework that harnesses the structural information of the research papers and the relation between the citation context and the  cited  paper  for  citation  classification.
Our  initial  experiments  on  three  benchmark  citation  classification  datasets show that with incorporating cited paper information (title), our neural model achieves a new state of the art on the ACL-ARC dataset with an absolute increase of 5.3% in the F1 score over the previous best model.
Our approach also outperforms the submissions made in the 3C Shared task: Citation Context Classification with an increase of 8% and 3.6%over the previous best Public F1-macro and Private F1-macro scores respectively.
We present ParCzech 3.0, a speech corpus of the Czech parliamentary speeches from The Czech Chamber of Deputies which took place from 25th November 2013 to 1st April 2021.
Different from previous speech corpora of Czech, we preserve not just orthography but also all the available metadata (speaker identities, gender, web pages links, affiliations committees, political groups, etc.)
and complement this with automatic morphological and syntactic annotation, and named entities recognition.
The corpus is encoded in the TEI format which allows for a straightforward and versatile exploitation.
The rather rich metadata and annotation make the corpus relevant for a~wide audience of researchers ranging from engineers in the speech community to theoretical linguists studying rhetorical patterns at scale.

This paper presents the University of Edinburgh’s constrained submissions of English-German and English-Hausa systems to the
WMT 2021 shared task on news translation.
We build En-De systems in three stages: corpus filtering, back-translation, and fine-tuning.
For En-Ha we use an iterative back-translation
approach on top of pre-trained En-De models
and investigate vocabulary embedding mapping.
Task-oriented dialogue systems typically require manual annotation of dialogue slots in training data, which is costly to obtain.
We propose a method that eliminates this requirement:
We use weak supervision from existing linguistic annotation models to identify potential slot candidates, then automatically identify domain-relevant slots by using clustering algorithms.
Furthermore, we use the resulting slot annotation to train a neural-network-based tagger that is able to perform slot tagging with no human intervention.
This tagger is trained solely on the outputs of our method and thus does not rely on any labeled data.
Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in slot tagging without labeled training data on four different dialogue domains.
Moreover, we find that slot annotations discovered by our model significantly improve the performance of an end-to-end dialogue response generation model, compared to using no slot annotation at all.
This is a work-in-progress paper on evaluative
analysis of different approaches to managing representations of facts and attitudes in linguistics.
The aim of
this comparative analysis is to find the most suitable approach for developing an annotation scheme in order to
build a dictionary of attitudinal expressions during the further stages of the project.
Among the approaches analyzed
are the Appraisal Theory, the scheme developed by
Bednarek, as well as sentiment analysis and opinion
mining techniques, and argument mining.
The
results of the current paper should be considered as the first
step in the research of distinguishing facts and attitudes in
diplomatic speeches of the United Nations Security Council.
Machine Translation is a task of automatically translating text from one language
into another.
In recent years, solutions based on neural networks have dominated
the field.
In this talk I will give a short introduction to the topic and mention a few tricks
that can be used to improve the final quality of translation.
I will also share my
experience from participating in one of the longest-running international Machine
Translation competitions.
In this paper, we show that automatically-generated questions and answers can be used to evaluate the quality of Machine Translation systems.
Building on recent work on the evaluation of abstractive text summarization, we propose a new metric for system-level Machine Translation evaluation, compare it with other state-of-the-art solutions, and show its robustness by conducting experiments for various translation directions.
In this paper, we describe our submission to the WMT 2021 Metrics Shared Task.
We use the automatically-generated questions and answers to evaluate the quality of Machine Translation (MT) systems.
Our submission builds upon the recently proposed MTEQA framework.
Experiments on WMT20 evaluation datasets show that at the system-level the MTEQA metric achieves performance comparable with other state-of-the-art solutions, while considering only a certain amount of information from the whole translation.
Ve většině scénářů destilace nebo krádeže neuronových strojových překladů se k výcviku nového modelu (studenta) používá hypotéza s nejvyšším bodovým ohodnocením cílového modelu (učitele).
Jsou-li k dispozici i referenční překlady, pak lze lepší hypotézy (s ohledem na odkazy) přetížit a špatné hypotézy buď odstranit, nebo podtrhnout.
Tento dokument zkoumá prostředí metody odběru vzorků (prořezávání, hypotetické nadměrné vzorkování a nedostatečné vzorkování, deduplikace a jejich kombinace) s anglickými až českými a anglickými až německými modely MT pomocí standardních metrik hodnocení MT.
Ukazujeme, že pečlivé nadměrné vzorkování a kombinace s původními údaji vede k lepším výsledkům ve srovnání se školením pouze o původních nebo syntetizovaných údajích nebo jejich přímé kombinaci.
We test the natural expectation that using MT in professional translation saves human processing time.
The last such study was carried out by Sanchez-Torron and Koehn (2016) with phrase-based MT, artificially reducing the translation quality.
In contrast, we focus on neural MT (NMT) of high quality, which has become the state-of-the-art approach since then and also got adopted by most translation companies.
Through an experimental study involving over 30 professional translators for English -> Czech translation, we examine the relationship between NMT performance and post-editing time and quality.
Across all models, we found that better MT systems indeed lead to fewer changes in the sentences in this industry setting.
The relation between system quality and post-editing time is however not straightforward and, contrary to the results on phrase-based MT, BLEU is definitely not a stable predictor of the time or final output quality.
End-to-end neural automatic speech recognition systems achieved recently  state-of-the-art results but they require large datasets and extensive computing resources.
Transfer learning has been proposed to overcome these difficulties even across languages, e.g., German ASR trained from an English model.
We experiment with much less related languages, reusing an English model for Czech ASR.
To simplify the transfer, we propose to use an intermediate alphabet, Czech without accents, and we document that it is a highly effective strategy.
The technique is also useful on Czech data alone, in the style of "coarse-to-fine" training.
We achieve substantial reductions in training time as well as word error rate (WER).
In this paper, we present a preliminary study of three intensifiers (absolutně, naprosto, úplně) based on data from three different corpora, a written corpus SYN2020, a web corpus ONLINE-ARCHIVE, and a spoken corpus ORTOFON 1.
Providing a parallel annotation of a random sample of each intensifier, we focus on their functions and meanings in context.
We analyse their properties in order to define those features which are relevant to their word class assignment, and to prepare grounds for the future disambiguation tasks.
This paper presents the results of the WMT21
Metrics Shared Task.
Participants were asked
to score the outputs of the translation systems competing in the WMT21 News Translation Task with automatic metrics on two different domains: news and TED talks.
All metrics were evaluated on how well they correlate at the system- and segment-level with
human ratings.
Contrary to previous years’
editions, this year we acquired our own human ratings based on expert-based human evaluation via Multidimensional Quality Metrics
(MQM).
This setup had several advantages:
(i) expert-based evaluation has been shown
to be more reliable, (ii) we were able to
evaluate all metrics on two different domains
using translations of the same MT systems,
(iii) we added 5 additional translations coming from the same system during system development.
In addition, we designed three
challenge sets that evaluate the robustness of
all automatic metrics.
We present an extensive analysis on how well metrics perform
on three language pairs: English→German,
English→Russian and Chinese→English.
We
further show the impact of different reference
translations on reference-based metrics and
compare our expert-based MQM annotation
with the DA scores acquired by WMT.
The paper presents a novel and unified morphological description of numerals and pronouns, as compiled for the newest edition of the Prague Dependency Treebank (Prague Dependency Treebank – Consolidated 1.0) and its integral part the morphological dictionary MorfFlex.
On the basis of considerable experience with real data annotation and the use of the morphological dictionary, particular changes were proposed.
For both of the parts of speech a new set of subtypes was proposed, based mainly on the morphological criterion and its combination with semantic properties and other relevant features, such as definiteness in numerals and possessivity, reflexivity and clitichood in pronouns.
Each subtype has a specific value at the 2nd position of the morphological tag which serves also as an indicator of the applicability of other tag categories.
We propose a character-based non-autoregressive GEC approach, with automatically generated character transformations.
Recently, per-word classification of correction edits has proven an efficient, parallelizable alternative to current encoder-decoder GEC systems.
We show that word replacement edits may be suboptimal and lead to explosion of rules for spelling, diacritization and errors in morphologically rich languages, and propose a method for generating character transformations from GEC corpus.
Finally, we train character transformation models for Czech, German and Russian, reaching solid results and dramatic speedup compared to autoregressive systems.
The source code is released at https://github.com/ufal/wnut2021_character_transformations_gec.
We present RobeCzech, a monolingual RoBERTa language representation model trained on Czech data.
RoBERTa is a robustly optimized Transformer-based pretraining approach.
We show that RobeCzech considerably outperforms equally-sized multilingual and Czech-trained contextualized language representation models, surpasses current state of the art in all five evaluated NLP tasks and reaches state-of-the-art results in four of them.
The RobeCzech model is released publicly at https://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3691 and https://huggingface.co/ufal/robeczech-base.
State-of-the-art contextual embeddings are obtained from large language models available only for a few languages.
For others, we need to learn representations using a multilingual model.
There is an ongoing debate on whether multilingual embeddings can be aligned in a space shared across many languages.
The novel Orthogonal Structural Probe (Limisiewicz and Mareček, 2021) allows us to answer this question for specific linguistic features and learn a projection based only on mono-lingual annotated datasets.
We evaluate syntactic (UD) and lexical (WordNet) structural information encoded inmBERT's contextual representations for nine diverse languages.
We observe that for languages closely related to English, no transformation is needed.
The evaluated information is encoded in a shared cross-lingual embedding space.
For other languages, it is beneficial to apply orthogonal transformation learned separately for each language.
We successfully apply our findings to zero-shot and few-shot cross-lingual parsing.
State-of-the-art contextual embeddings are obtained from large language models available only for a few languages.

With the recent success of pre-trained models in NLP, a significant focus was put on interpreting their representations.
One of the most prominent approaches is structural probing (Hewitt and Manning, 2019), where a linear projection of word embeddings is performed in order to approximate the topology of dependency structures.
In this work, we introduce a new type of structural probing, where the linear projection is decomposed into 1. iso-morphic space rotation; 2. linear scaling that identifies and scales the most relevant dimensions.
In addition to syntactic dependency, we evaluate our method on two novel tasks (lexical hypernymy and position in a sentence).
We jointly train the probes for multiple tasks and experimentally show that lexical and syntactic information is separated in the representations.
Moreover, the orthogonal constraint makes the Structural Probes less vulnerable to memorization.

Although mobility and movement has recently gained importance within interactionist studies of social action, not much is known about the consequentiality of being on the move for the particular unfolding of interactional episodes.
Utilising two publicly accessible video clips of ‘road rage’ situations, we describe and analyse the centrality of hand-work in the escalation and decline of an emotionally charged interaction between members of traffic.
Avoiding an a priori cognitivist stance, we show in detail how the work of hands can be constitutive of anger itself, and that it can lead to open conflict on the boundary of physical violence.
The present article investigates possibilities and limits of local (shallow) analysis of discourse coherence with respect to the phenomena of global coherence and higher composition of texts.
The Covid-19 pandemic has created a global demand for accurate and up-to-date information which often originates in English and needs to be translated.
To train a machine translation system for such a narrow topic, we leverage in-domain training data in other languages both from related and unrelated language families.
We experiment with different transfer learning schedules and observe that transferring via more than one auxiliary language brings the most improvement.
We compare the performance with joint multilingual training and report superior results of the transfer learning approach.
We describe our two NMT systems submitted to the WMT2021 shared task in English-Czech news translation: CUNI-DocTransformer (document-level CUBBITT) and CUNI-Marian-Baselines.
We improve the former with a better sentence-segmentation pre-processing
and a post-processing for fixing errors in numbers and units.
We use the latter for experiments with various backtranslation techniques.
We present our Charles-UPF submission for the Shared Task on Evaluating Accuracy in Generated Texts at INLG 2021.
Our system can detect the errors automatically using a combination of a rule-based natural language generation (NLG) system and pretrained language models (LMs).
We first utilize a rule-based NLG system to generate sentences with
facts that can be derived from the input.
For each sentence we evaluate, we select a subset of facts which are relevant by measuring semantic similarity to the sentence in question.
Finally, we finetune a pretrained language model on annotated data along with the relevant facts for fine-grained error detection.
On the test set, we achieve 69% recall and 75% precision with a model trained on a mixture of human-annotated and synthetic data.
The talk presents overall task findings and LMU Munich submission to the very low resource and unsupervised translation at WMT21.
Further, we discuss design decisions made both by LMU and other shared task participants and speculate what the future directions in machine translation of low resource translation might be.
We present the findings of the WMT2021 Shared Tasks in Unsupervised MT and Very Low Resource Supervised MT.
Within the task, the community studied very low resource translation between German and Upper Sorbian, unsupervised translation between German and Lower Sorbian and low resource translation between Russian and Chuvash, all minority languages with active language communities working on preserving the languages, who are partners in the evaluation.
Thanks to this, we were able to obtain most digital data available for these languages and offer them to the task participants.
In total, six teams participated in the shared task.
The paper discusses the background, presents the tasks and results, and discusses best practices for the future.
We present our submissions to the WMT21 shared task in Unsupervised and Very Low-Resource machine translation between German and Upper Sorbian, German and Lower Sorbian, and Russian and Chuvash.
Our low-resource systems (German↔Upper Sorbian, Russian↔Chuvash) are pre-trained on high-resource pairs of related languages.
We fine-tune those systems using the available authentic parallel data and improve by iterated back-translation.
The unsupervised German↔Lower Sorbian system is initialized by the best Upper Sorbian system and improved by iterated back-translation using monolingual data only.
We observe a severe under-reporting of the different kinds of errors that Natural Language Generation systems make.
This is a problem, because mistakes are an important indicator of where systems should still be improved.
If authors only report overall performance metrics, the research community is left in the dark about the specific weaknesses that are exhibited by ‘state-of-the-art’ research.
Next to quantifying the extent of error under-reporting, this position paper provides recommendations for error identification, analysis and reporting.
We present the script of the theatre play AI: When a Robot Writes a Play (AI: Když robot píše hru), which was written by artificial intelligence within the THEaiTRE project.
The high performance of large pretrained language models (LLMs) such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) on NLP tasks has prompted questions about BERT’s linguistic capabilities, and how they differ from humans’.
In this paper, we approach this question by examining BERT’s knowledge of lexical semantic relations.
We focus on hypernymy, the “is-a” relation that relates a word to a superordinate category.
We use a prompting methodology to simply
ask BERT what the hypernym of a given word is.
We find that, in a setting where all hypernyms are guessable via prompting, BERT knows hypernyms with up to 57% accuracy.
Moreover, BERT with prompting outperforms other unsupervised models for hypernym discovery even in an unconstrained scenario.
However, BERT’s predictions and performance on
a dataset containing uncommon hyponyms and
hypernyms indicate that its knowledge of hypernymy is still limited.
BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020), a recently proposed automatic metric for machine translation quality, uses BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), a large pre-trained language model to evaluate candidate translations with respect to a gold translation.
Taking advantage of BERT’s semantic and syntactic abilities, BERTScore seeks to avoid the flaws of earlier approaches like BLEU, instead scoring candidate translations based on their semantic similarity to the gold sentence.
However, BERT is not infallible; while its performance on NLP tasks set a new state of the art in general, studies of specific syntactic and semantic phenomena have shown where BERT’s performance deviates from that of humans more generally.
This naturally raises the questions we address in this paper: what are the strengths and weaknesses of BERTScore?
Do they relate to
known weaknesses on the part of BERT?
We find that while BERTScore can detect when a candidate differs from a reference in important content words, it is less sensitive to smaller errors, especially if the candidate is lexically or stylistically similar to the reference.
In this paper we present Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR), a meaning representation designed to annotate the semantic content of a text.
UMR is primarily based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), an annotation framework initially designed for English, but also draws from other meaning representations.
UMR extends AMR to other languages, particularly morphologically complex, low-resource languages.
UMR also adds features to AMR that are critical to semantic interpretation and enhances AMR by proposing a companion document-level representation that captures linguistic phenomena such as coreference as well as temporal and modal dependencies that potentially go beyond sentence boundaries.
Word association is an important part of human language.
Many techniques for capturing semantic relations between words exist, but their ability to model word associations is rarely tested in a real application.
In this paper, we evaluate three models aimed at different types of word associations: a word-embedding model for synonymy, a point-wise mutual information model for word collocations, and a dependency model for common properties of words.
The quality of the proposed models is tested on English and Czech by humans in an online version of the word-association game “Codenames”.
The objectives of our work are to propose the relevant Universal Dependencies morphological features for Indonesian dependency treebank and to apply the proposed features to an existing treebank.
Making sense of language is no easy task.
All the more since we have such an intimate experience of it -- the trees that we regularly encounter in everyday communication may make it hard to see the forest.
In this situation, computers can help us take a step back and look at large quantities of text from a fifty-thousand-foot view.
This paper describes the team (“ODIANLP”)’s submission to WAT 2020.
We have participated in the English→Hindi Multimodal task and Indic task.
We have used the state-of-the-art Transformer model for the translation task and Inception ResNetV2 for the Hindi Image Captioning task.
Our submission tops in English→Hindi Multimodal task in its track and Odia↔English translation tasks.
Also, our submissions performed well in the Indic Multilingual tasks.
The preparation of parallel corpora is a challenging task, particularly for languages that suffer from under-representation in the digital world.
In a multi-lingual country like India, the need for such parallel corpora is stringent for several low-resource languages.
In this work, we provide an extended English-Odia parallel corpus, OdiEnCorp 2.0, aiming particularly at Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems which will help translate English↔Odia.
OdiEnCorp 2.0 includes existing English-Odia corpora and we extended the collection by several other methods of data acquisition: parallel data scraping from many websites, including Odia Wikipedia, but also optical character recognition (OCR) to extract parallel data from scanned images.
Our OCR-based data extraction approach for building a parallel corpus is suitable for other low resource languages that lack in online content.
The resulting OdiEnCorp 2.0 contains 98,302 sentences and 1.69 million English and 1.47 million Odia tokens.
To the best of our knowledge, OdiEnCorp 2.0 is the largest Odia-English parallel corpus covering different domains and available freely for non-commercial and research purposes.
In this paper, we introduce the first Universal Dependencies (UD) treebank for standard Albanian, consisting of 60 sentences collected from the Albanian Wikipedia, annotated with lemmas, universal part-of-speech tags, morphological features and syntactic dependencies.
In addition to presenting the treebank itself, we discuss a selection of linguistic constructions in Albanian whose analysis in UD is not self-evident, including core arguments and the status of indirect objects, pronominal clitics, genitive constructions, prearticulated adjectives, and modal verbs.
We present PERIN, a novel permutation-invariant approach to sentence-to-graph semantic parsing.
PERIN is a versatile, cross-framework and language independent architecture for universal modeling of semantic structures.
Our system participated in the CoNLL 2020 shared task, Cross-Framework Meaning Representation Parsing (MRP 2020), where it was evaluated on five different frameworks (AMR, DRG, EDS, PTG and UCCA) across four languages.
PERIN was one of the winners of the shared task.
The source code and pretrained models are available at http://www.github.com/ufal/perin.
Multilingualism is a cultural cornerstone of Europe and firmly anchored in the European Treaties including full language equality.
However, language barriers impacting business, cross-lingual and cross-cultural communication are still omnipresent.
Language Technologies (LTs) are a powerful means to break down these barriers.
While the last decade has seen various initiatives that created a multitude of approaches and technologies tailored to Europe’s specific needs, there is still an immense level of fragmentation.
At the same time, AI has become an increasingly important concept in the European Information and Communication Technology area.
For a few years now, AI – including many opportunities, synergies but also misconceptions – has been overshadowing every other topic.
We present an overview of the European LT landscape, describing funding programmes, activities, actions and challenges in the different countries with regard to LT, including the current state of play in industry and the LT market.
We present a brief overview of the main LT-related activities on the EU level in the last ten years and develop strategic guidance with regard to four key dimensions.
With 24 official EU and many additional languages, multilingualism in Europe and an inclusive Digital Single Market can only be enabled through Language Technologies (LTs).
European LT business is dominated by hundreds of SMEs and a few large players.
Many are world-class, with technologies that outperform the global players.
However, European LT business is also fragmented – by nation states, languages, verticals and sectors, significantly holding back its impact.
The European Language Grid (ELG) project addresses this fragmentation by establishing the ELG as the primary platform for LT in Europe.
The ELG is a scalable cloud platform, providing, in an easy-to-integrate way, access to hundreds of commercial and non-commercial LTs for all European languages, including running tools and services as well as data sets and resources.
Once fully operational, it will enable the commercial and non-commercial European LT community to deposit and upload their technologies and data sets into the ELG, to deploy them through the grid, and to connect with other resources.
The ELG will boost the Multilingual Digital Single Market towards a thriving European LT community, creating new jobs and opportunities.
Furthermore, the ELG project organises two open calls for up to 20 pilot projects.
It also sets up 32 national competence centres and the European LT Council for outreach and coordination purposes.
Some methods of automatic simultaneous translation of a long-form speech allow revisions of outputs,
trading accuracy for low latency.
Deploying these systems
for users faces the problem of presenting subtitles in a limited space, such as two lines on a television screen.
The
subtitles must be shown promptly, incrementally, and with
adequate time for reading.
We provide an algorithm for
subtitling.
Furthermore, we propose a way how to estimate
the overall usability of the combination of automatic translation and subtitling by measuring the quality, latency, and
stability on a test set, and propose an improved measure
for translation latency.
This paper is an ELITR system submission for the non-native speech translation task at IWSLT 2020.
We describe systems for offline ASR, real-time ASR, and our cascaded approach to offline SLT and real-time SLT.
We select our primary candidates from a pool of pre-existing systems, develop a new end-to-end general ASR system, and a hybrid ASR trained on non-native speech.
The provided small validation set prevents us from carrying out a complex validation, but we submit all the unselected candidates for contrastive evaluation on the test set.
We investigate the effect of training NMT models on multiple target languages.
We hypothesize that the integration of multiple languages and the increase of linguistic diversity will lead to a stronger representation of syntactic and semantic features captured by the model.
We test our hypothesis on two different NMT architectures: The widely-used Transformer architecture and the Attention Bridge architecture.
We train models on Europarl data and quantify the level of syntactic and semantic information discovered by the models using three different methods: SentEval linguistic probing tasks, an analysis of the attention structures regarding the inherent phrase and dependency information and a structural probe on contextualized word representations.
Our results show evidence that with growing number of target languages the Attention Bridge model increasingly picks up certain linguistic properties including some syntactic and semantic aspects of the sentence whereas Transformer models are largely unaffected.
The latter also applies to phrase structure and syntactic dependencies that do not seem to be developing in sentence representations when increasing the linguistic diversity in training to translate.
This is rather surprising and may hint on the relatively little influence of grammatical structure on language understanding.
In recent years, deep neural networks dominated the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
End-to-end-trained models can do tasks as skillfully as never before and develop their own language representations.
However, they act as black boxes that are very hard to interpret.
This calls for an inspection to what extent the linguistic conceptualizations are consistent with what the models learn.
Do neural networks use morphology and syntax the way people do when they talk about language?
Or do they develop their own way?
In our talk, we will half-open the neural black-box and analyze the internal representations of input sentences with respect to their morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties.
We will focus on word embeddings as well as contextual embeddings and self-attentions of the Transformer models (BERT, NMT).
We will show both supervised and unsupervised analysis approaches.
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the first shared task on End-to-End Natural Language Generation (NLG) and identifies avenues for future research based on the results.
This shared task aimed to assess whether recent end-to-end NLG systems can generate more complex output by learning from datasets containing higher lexical richness, syntactic complexity and diverse discourse phenomena.
Introducing novel automatic and human metrics, we compare 62 systems submitted by 17 institutions, covering a wide range of approaches, including machine learning architectures – with the majority implementing sequence-to-sequence models (seq2seq) – as well as systems based on grammatical rules and templates.
Seq2seq-based systems have demonstrated a great potential for NLG in the challenge.
We find that seq2seq systems generally score high in terms of word-overlap metrics and human evaluations of naturalness – with the winning Slug system (Juraska et al., 2018) being seq2seq-based.
However, vanilla seq2seq models often fail to correctly express a given meaning representation if they lack a strong semantic control mechanism applied during decoding.
Moreover, seq2seq models can be outperformed by hand-engineered systems in terms of overall quality, as well as complexity, length and diversity of outputs.
This research has influenced, inspired and motivated a number of recent studies outwith the original competition, which we also summarise as part of this paper.
A major challenge in evaluating data-to-text (D2T) generation is measuring the semantic accuracy of the generated text, i.e.
its faithfulness to the input data.
We propose a new metric for evaluating the semantic accuracy of D2T generation based on a neural model pretrained for natural language inference (NLI).
We use the NLI model to check textual entailment between the input data and the output text in both directions, allowing us to reveal omissions or hallucinations.
Input data are converted to text for NLI using trivial templates.
Our experiments on two recent D2T datasets show that our metric can achieve high accuracy in identifying erroneous system outputs.
This paper presents the results of the news translation task and the similar language translation task, both organised
alongside the  Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) 2020.
In the news task, participants
were asked to build machine translation systems for any of 11 language pairs, to be evaluated on test sets consisting mainly of news stories.
The task was also opened up
to additional test suites to probe specific aspects of translation.
In the similar language translation task, participants built
machine translation systems for translating between closely related pairs of languages.
While recent neural sequence-to-sequence models have greatly improved the quality of speech synthesis, there has not been a system capable of fast training, fast inference and high-quality audio synthesis at the same time.
We propose a student-teacher network capable of high-quality faster-than-real-time spectrogram synthesis, with low requirements on computational resources and fast training time.
We show that self-attention layers are not necessary for generation of high quality audio.
We utilize simple convolutional blocks with residual connections in both student and teacher networks and use only a single attention layer in the teacher model.
Coupled with a MelGAN vocoder, our model's voice quality was rated significantly higher than Tacotron 2.
Our model can be efficiently trained on a single GPU and can run in real time even on a CPU.
We provide both our source code and audio samples in our GitHub repository.
In Czech (similarly as in other Slavic languages), the clitic reflexives serve – among others – as a derivational means deriving lexical reciprocal verbs, i.e., those verbs that encode mutuality directly in their lexical meaning.
Here I draw a line between those lexical reciprocal verbs with which the reflexives introduce mutuality (nenávidět se ‘to hate each other’ ← nenávidět ‘to hate sb’ and slíbit si ‘to promise sth to each other’ ← slíbit ‘to promise sth to sb’) and those with which the reflexives have another function (oddělit se ‘to separate from each other’ ← oddělit ‘to separate sb/sth from sb/sth’).
I show that lexical reciprocal verbs of the former type uniformly form the so-called discontinuous constructions with the nominative subject and comitative indirect object (e.g., Petr si slíbil s Marií věrnost.
‘Peter and Mary promised fidelity to each other.’) and that they fall into several semantic classes, which, however, semantically overlap to a great extent with lexical reciprocal verbs of other types.
In this paper, we draw attention to reciprocity in Czech light verb constructions – a language phenomenon, which has not been discussed yet.
Reciprocity is contributed to light verb constructions by predictive nouns, as they are the nouns that represent the semantic core of these constructions.
Here we focus on reciprocal light verb constructions derived by the syntactic operation of reciprocalization.
We show that the complex mapping of semantic participants onto valency complementations, characteristic of reciprocalization, is reflected in reciprocal light verb constructions in the same way as in reciprocal nominal constructions.
The main difference between reciprocal nominal constructions and reciprocal light verb constructions lies in the morphosyntactic expression of reciprocalized participants.
We demonstrate that surface syntactic changes in reciprocal light verb constructions are regular enough to be described on the rule basis: the rule based generation of reciprocal light verb constructions requires a cooperation of two sets of rules – rules for deep and surface syntactic structure formation of light verb constructions and rules for capturing reciprocity.
Recent progress in neural machine translation is directed towards larger neural networks trained on an increasing amount of hardware resources.
As a result, NMT models are costly to train, both financially, due to the electricity and hardware cost, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint.
It is especially true in transfer learning for its additional cost of training
the ``parent'' model before transferring knowledge and training the desired ``child'' model.
In this paper, we propose a simple method of re-using an already trained model for different language pairs where there is no need for modifications in model architecture.
Our approach does not need a separate parent model for each investigated language pair, as it is typical in NMT transfer learning.
To show the applicability of our method, we recycle a Transformer model trained by different researchers and use it to seed models for different language pairs.
We achieve better translation quality and shorter convergence times than when training from random initialization.
Gender  bias  in  machine  translation  can  manifest when choosing gender inflections based on  spurious  gender  correlations.
For  example,  always  translating  doctors  as  men  and nurses  as  women.
This  can  be  particularly harmful as models become more popular and deployed  within  commercial  systems.
Our work presents the largest evidence for the phenomenon  in  more  than  19  systems  submitted to the WMT over four diverse target languages:  Czech, German, Polish, and Russian.To achieve this, we use WinoMT, a recent automatic test suite which examines gender coreference and bias when translating from English to languages with grammatical gender.
We ex-tend  WinoMT  to  handle  two  new  languages tested in WMT: Polish and Czech.
We find that all  systems  consistently  use  spurious  correlations  in  the  data  rather  than  meaningful  contextual information.
CLARIN is a European Research Infrastructure providing access to digital language resources and tools from across Europe and beyond to researchers in the humanities and social sciences.
This paper focuses on CLARIN as a platform for the sharing of language resources.
It zooms in on the service offer for the aggregation of language repositories and the value proposition for a number of communities that benefit from the enhanced visibility of their data and services as a result of integration in CLARIN.
The enhanced findability of language resources is serving the social sciences and humanities (SSH) community at large and supports research communities that aim to collaborate based on virtual collections for a specific domain.
The paper also addresses the wider landscape of service platforms based on language technologies which has the potential of becoming a powerful set of interoperable facilities to a variety of communities of use.
In this paper, we explore the potential benefits of leveraging eye-tracking information for dependency parsing on the English part of the Dundee corpus.
To achieve this, we cast dependency parsing as a sequence labelling task and then augment the neural model for sequence labelling with eye-tracking features.
We then experiment with a variety of parser setups ranging from lexicalized parsing to a delexicalized parser.
Our experiments show that for a lexicalized parser, although the improvements are positive they are not significant whereas our delexicalized parser significantly outperforms the baseline we established.
We also analyze the contribution of various eye-tracking features towards the different parser setups and find that eye-tracking features contain information which is complementary in nature, thus implying that augmenting the parser with various gaze features grouped together provides better performance than any individual gaze feature.
We present our submission to the SIGTYP 2020 Shared Task on the prediction of typological features.
We submit a constrained system, predicting typological features only based on the WALS database.
We investigate two approaches.
The simpler of the two is a system based on estimating correlation of feature values within languages by computing conditional probabilities and mutual information.
The second approach is to train a
neural predictor operating on precomputed language embeddings based on WALS features.
Our submitted system combines the two approaches based on their self-estimated confidence scores.
We reach the accuracy of 70.7% on the
test data.
Deep Universal Dependencies is a collection of treebanks derived semi-automatically from Universal Dependencies.
It contains additional deep-syntactic and semantic annotations.
Version of Deep UD corresponds to the version of UD it is based on.
Note however that some UD treebanks have been omitted from Deep UD.
For over 50 years, researchers have been trying to teach computers to read music notation, referred to as Optical Music Recognition (OMR).
However, this field is still difficult to access for new researchers, especially those without a significant musical background: Few introductory materials are available, and, furthermore, the field has struggled with defining itself and building a shared terminology.
In this work, we address these shortcomings by (1) providing a robust definition of OMR and its relationship to related fields, (2) analyzing how OMR inverts the music encoding process to recover the musical notation and the musical semantics from documents, and (3) proposing a taxonomy of OMR, with most notably a novel taxonomy of applications.
Additionally, we discuss how deep learning affects modern OMR research, as opposed to the traditional pipeline.
Based on this work, the reader should be able to attain a basic understanding of OMR: its objectives, its inherent structure, its relationship to other fields, the state of the art, and the research opportunities it affords.
In this paper, we introduce a new and improved version of DeriSearch, a search engine and visualizer for word-formation networks.
Word-formation networks are datasets that express derivational, compounding and other word-formation relations between words.
They are usually expressed as directed graphs, in which nodes correspond to words and edges to the relations between them.
Some networks also add other linguistic information, such as morphological segmentation of the words or identification of the processes expressed by the relations.
Networks for morphologically rich languages with productive derivation or compounding have large connected components, which are difficult to visualize.
For example, in the network for Czech, DeriNet 2.0, connected components over 500 words large contain 1/8 of the vocabulary, including its most common parts.
In the network for Latin, Word Formation Latin, over 10 000 words (1/3 of the vocabulary) are in a single connected component.
With the recent release of the Universal Derivations collection of word-formation networks for several languages, there is a need for a searching and visualization tool that would allow browsing such complex data.
The authors address the legal issues relating to the creation and use of language models.
The article begins with an explanation of the development of language technologies.
The authors analyse the technological process within the framework copyright, related rights and personal data protection law.
The authors also cover commercial use of language models.
The authors’ main argument is that legal restrictions applicable to language data containing copyrighted material and personal data usually do not apply to language mod-els.
Language models are not normally considered derivative works.
Due to a wide range of language models, this position is not absolute.
Large Scale Colloquial Persian Dataset" (LSCP) is hierarchically organized in asemantic taxonomy that focuses on multi-task informal Persian language understanding as a comprehensive problem.
LSCP includes 120M sentences from 27M casual Persian tweets with its dependency relations in syntactic annotation, Part-of-speech tags, sentiment polarity and automatic translation of original Persian sentences in five different languages (EN, CS, DE, IT, HI).
Language recognition has been significantly advanced in recent years by means of modern machine learning methods such as deep
learning and benchmarks with rich annotations.
However, research is still limited in low-resource formal languages.
This consists of
a significant gap in describing the colloquial language especially for low-resourced ones such as Persian.
In order to target this gap
for low resource languages, we propose a “Large Scale Colloquial Persian Dataset” (LSCP).
LSCP is hierarchically organized in a
semantic taxonomy that focuses on multi-task informal Persian language understanding as a comprehensive problem.
This encompasses
the recognition of multiple semantic aspects in the human-level sentences, which naturally captures from the real-world sentences.
We
believe that further investigations and processing, as well as the application of novel algorithms and methods, can strengthen enriching
computerized understanding and processing of low resource languages.
The proposed corpus consists of 120M sentences resulted from
27M tweets annotated with parsing tree, part-of-speech tags, sentiment polarity and translation in five different languages.
In this work, we propose an algorithm that induces morphological networks for Persian and Turkish.
The algorithm uses morpheme-segmented lexicons for the two languages.
The resulting networks capture both derivational and inflectional relations.
The network induction algorithm can use either manually annotated lists of roots and affixes, or simple heuristics to distinguish roots from affixes.
We evaluate both variants empirically.
We use our large hand-segmented set of word forms in the experiments with Persian, which is contrasted with employing only a very limited manually segmented lexicon for Turkish that existed previously.
The network induction algorithm uses gold segmentation data for initializing the networks, which are subsequently extended with additional corpus attested word forms that were unseen in the segmented data.
For this purpose, we use existing morpheme-segmentation tools, namely supervised and unsupervised version of Morfessor, and (unsupervised) MorphSyn.
The experimental results show that the accuracy of segmented initial data influences derivational network quality.
We present COSTRA 1.0, a dataset of complex sentence transformations.
The dataset is intended for the study of sentence-level embeddings beyond simple word alternations or standard paraphrasing.
This first version of the dataset is limited to sentences in Czech but the construction method is universal and we plan to use it also for other languages.
The dataset consists of 4,262 unique sentences with an average length of 10 words, illustrating 15 types of modifications, such as simplification, generalization, or formal and informal language variation.
The hope is that with this dataset, we should be able to test semantic properties of sentence embeddings and perhaps even to find some topologically interesting ''skeleton'' in the sentence embedding space.
A preliminary analysis using LASER, multi-purpose multi-lingual sentence embeddings suggests that the LASER space does not exhibit the desired properties
In this paper, we present a new dataset for testing geometric properties of sentence embeddings spaces.
In particular, we concentrate on examining how well sentence embeddings capture complex phenomena such paraphrases, tense or generalization.
The dataset is a direct expansion of Costra 1.0, which we extended with more sentences and sentence comparisons.
We show that available off-the-shelf embeddings do not possess essential attributes such as having synonymous sentences embedded closer to each other than similar sentences with a significantly different meaning.
On the other hand, some embeddings appear to capture the linear order of sentence aspects such as style (formality and simplicity of the language) or time (past to future).
We present a thorough comparison of two principal approaches to Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval: document translation (DT) and query translation (QT).
Our experiments are conducted using the cross-lingual test collection produced within the CLEF eHealth information retrieval tasks in 2013–2015 containing English documents and queries in several European languages.
We exploit the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) paradigms and train several domain-specific and task-specific machine translation systems to translate the non-English queries into English (for the QT approach) and the English documents to all the query languages (for the DT approach).
The results show that the quality of QT by SMT is sufficient enough to outperform the retrieval results of the DT approach for all the languages.
NMT then further boosts translation quality and retrieval quality for both QT and DT for most languages, but still, QT provides generally better retrieval results than DT.
Researchers at Charles University, Švanda Theater and the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague are currently working on an intriguing research project that merges artificial intelligence and robotics with theater.
Their project's main objective is to use artificial intelligence to create an innovative theatrical performance, which is expected to premiere in January 2021.
We introduce an approach to multilingual speech synthesis which uses the meta-learning concept of contextual parameter generation and produces natural-sounding multilingual speech using more languages and less training data than previous approaches.
Our model is based on Tacotron 2 with a fully convolutional input text encoder whose weights are predicted by a separate parameter generator network.
To boost voice cloning, the model uses an adversarial speaker classifier with a gradient reversal layer that removes speaker-specific information from the encoder.
We arranged two experiments to compare our model with baselines using various levels of cross-lingual parameter sharing, in order to evaluate: (1) stability and performance when training on low amounts of data, (2) pronunciation accuracy and voice quality of code-switching synthesis.
For training, we used the CSS10 dataset and our new small dataset based on Common Voice recordings in five languages.
Our model is shown to effectively share information across languages and according to a subjective evaluation test, it produces more natural and accurate code-switching speech than the baselines.
In my talk, I will summarize our recent activities in text and speech
translation.
I will start with the EU project ELITR (https://elitr.eu/) where we
are aiming at highly multi-lingual live translation of speech, highlighting the
technical challenges (you probably know all of them) but I will also touch upon
getting a better input from the end users so that better translation quality is
possible (our activity on 'outbound translation' in the EU project Bergamot,
https://browser.mt/).
Finally, I will ask for collaboration on my
overall basic-research quest: to get the meaning right and to model it in a more
human-like way.
ELITR (European Live Translator) project
aims to create a speech translation system
for simultaneous subtitling of conferences
and online meetings targetting up to 43
languages.
The technology is tested by
the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and by alfaview®, a German online
conferencing system.
Other project goals
are to advance document-level and multilingual machine translation, automatic
speech recognition, and meeting summarization.
MorfFlex CZ (the latest version is MorfFlex CZ 2.0)  is the Czech morphological dictionary developed originally by Jan Hajič as a spelling checker and lemmatization dictionary.
MorfFlex is a flat list of lemma-tag-wordform triples.
For each wordform, full inflectional information is coded in a positional tag.
Wordforms are organized into entries (paradigm instances or paradigms in short) according to their formal morphological behavior.
The paradigm (set of wordforms) is identified by a unique lemma.
Apart from traditional morphological categories, the description also contains some semantic, stylistic and derivational  information.
A richly annotated and genre-diversified language resource, The Prague Dependency Treebank – Consolidated 1.0 (PDT-C 1.0, or PDT-C in short in the sequel) is a consolidated release of the existing PDT-corpora of Czech data, uniformly annotated using the standard PDT scheme.
PDT-corpora included in PDT-C: Prague Dependency Treebank (the original PDT contents, written newspaper and journal texts from three genres); Czech part of Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank (translated financial texts, from English), Prague Dependency Treebank of Spoken Czech (spokem data, including audio and transcripts and multiple speech reconstruction annotation); PDT-Faust (user-generated texts).
The difference from the separately published original treebanks can be briefly described as follows: it is published in one package, to allow easier data handling for all the datasets; the data is enhanced with a manual linguistic annotation at the morphological layer and new version of morphological dictionary is enclosed; a common valency lexicon for all four original parts is enclosed.
Documentation provides two browsing and editing desktop tools (TrEd and MEd) and the corpus is also available online for searching using PML-TQ.
The system of adverbials with temporal meaning is analyzed here with specific emphasis on their surface expressions.
The traditional classification for the meanings applied as responses for the question When?, Since when?, Till when?, How long?, How often?
requires a more precise subcategorization with regard to systemic behavior of the adverbials.
For the primary temporal expressions answering the questions When?
and How long?, a system of subfunctors is proposed, while for the secondary meanings Since when?, Till when?, the corresponding functors are not splitted into subfunctors.
The meanings connected with the repetition and the frequency are not discussed here as they belong to the description of the boundary between lexicon and grammar.
An obituary devoted to the life and work of the late Professor Petr Sgall, the founder of computational linguistics in Czechoslovakia, a member of the Prague Linguistic Circle.
The analysis of the so-called focalizers, i.e.
particles such as E. also, only, even, and their Czech counterparts také, jenom, dokonce, based on the data from the English–Czech parallel corpus PCEDT, focused on (i) in which respects and under which conditions these focalizers may  be said to serve as discourse connectives, (ii) which particular discourse relations are indicated by the  focalizers in question.
Our detailed analysis of the data from the English–Czech annotated parallel corpus PCEDT confirms the hypothesis that the particles also, only and even as well as their Czech equivalents play basically a discoursive role of explicit connectives, though in a different way and to a different extent.
This paper summarizes findings of a three-year study on
verb synonymy in translation based on both syntactic and semantic criteria
and reports on recent results extending this work.
Primary language
resources used are existing Czech and English lexical and corpus
resources, namely the Prague Dependency Treebank-style valency lexicons,
FrameNet, VerbNet, PropBank, WordNet and the parallel Prague
Czech-English Dependency Treebank, which contains deep syntactic
and partially semantic annotation of running texts.
The resulting lexicon
(called formerly CzEngClass, now SynSemClass) and all associated
resources linked to the existing lexicons and corpora following from
this project are publicly and freely available.
While the project proper
assumes manual annotation work, we expect to use the resulting resource
(together with the existing ones) as a necessary resource for developing
automatic methods for extending such a lexicon, or creating similar lexicons
for other languages.
CzeDLex is an electronic lexicon of Czech discourse connectives with its data coming from a large treebank annotated with discourse relations.
Its new version CzeDLex 0.6 is significantly larger with respect to manually processed entries.
Also, its structure has been modified to allow for primary connectives to appear with multiple entries for a single discourse sense.
We present the new version of the lexicon and demonstrate possibilities of mining various types of information from the lexicon using PML-Tree Query.
Many linguistic theories and annotation frameworks contain a deep-syntactic and/or semantic layer.
While many of these frameworks have been applied to more than one language, none of them is anywhere near the number of languages that are covered in Universal Dependencies (UD).
In my talk, I will first discuss Enhanced Universal Dependencies (EUD), a set of semantically-oriented enhancements that have been proposed within the framework of Universal Dependencies (but which are still available only for a small number of languages).
I will also present some preliminary observations from the current shared task on parsing into EUD (https://universaldependencies.org/iwpt20/).
In the second part, I will present some additional enhancements, called Deep UD, which extend beyond the official UD guidelines.
I will focus on two aspects: how can these enhancements be useful for natural language understanding, and to what extent can they be obtained semi-automatically from the surface annotation for many typologically different languages.
Universal Dependencies is an international project and community that seeks to provide morphologically and syntactically annotated data for many languages, using a uniform annotation style.
We report on the Czech grant project MANYLA that was one of the driving forces behind UD.
Prague Tectogrammatical Graphs (PTG) is a meaning representation framework that originates in the tectogrammatical layer of the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) and is theoretically founded in Functional Generative Description of language (FGD).
PTG in its present form has been prepared for the CoNLL 2020 shared task on Cross-Framework Meaning Representation Parsing (MRP).
It is generated automatically from the Prague treebanks and stored in the JSON-based MRP graph interchange format.
The conversion is partially lossy; in this paper we describe what part of annotation was included and how it is represented in PTG.
We present our system for prediction of typological features from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), which participated in the shared task organized as a part of the SIGTYP 2020 workshop.
The Parliament of the Czech Republic consists of two chambers: the Chamber of Deputies (Lower House) and the Senate (Upper House).
In our work, we focus on agenda and documents that relate to the Chamber of Deputies.
Namely, we pay particular attention to stenographic protocols that record the Chamber of Deputies’ meetings.
Our overall goal is to continually compile the protocols into the TEI encoded corpus ParCzech and make the corpus accessible in a more user friendly way than the Parliament publishes the protocols.
In the very first stage of the compilation, the ParCzech corpus consists of the 2013+ protocols that we make accessible and searchable in the TEITOK web-based platform.
The ParCzech PS7 1.0 corpus is the very first member of the corpus family of data coming from the Parliament of the Czech Republic.
ParCzech PS7 1.0 consists of stenographic protocols that record the Chamber of Deputies' meetings held in the 7th term between 2013-2017.
The audio recordings are available as well.
Transcripts are provided in the original HTML as harvested, and also converted into TEI-derived XML format for use in TEITOK corpus manager.
The corpus is automatically enriched with the morphological and named-entity annotations using the procedures MorphoDita and NameTag.
Although the title of this report inherits the word "Manual" from the previous versions, it is no more intended to guide the annotators.
Rather it attempts to describe the current state of the morphological annotation in the Prague Dependency Treebank – Consolidated 1.0 (PDT-C 1.0) We believe that the guidelines can be of use to the users of the PDT-C 1.0 data, as well as for possible preparation of new data.
This overview introduces the task of parsing into enhanced universal dependencies, describes the datasets used for training and evaluation, and evaluation metrics.
We outline various approaches and discuss the results of the shared task.
The method of stylometry by most frequent words does not allow direct comparison of original texts and their translations, i.e.
across languages.
For instance, in a bilingual Czech-German text collection containing parallel texts (originals and translations in both directions, along with Czech and German translations from other languages), authors would not cluster across languages, since frequency word lists for any Czech texts are obviously going to be more similar to each other than to a German text, and the other way round.
We have tried to come up with an interlingua that would remove the language-specific features and possibly keep the linguistically independent features of individual author signal, if they exist.
We have tagged, lemmatized, and parsed each language counterpart with the corresponding language model in UDPipe, which provides a linguistic markup that is cross-lingual to a significant extent.
We stripped the output of language-dependent items, but that alone did not help much.
As a next step, we transformed the lemmas of both language counterparts into shared pseudolemmas based on a very crude Czech-German glossary, with a 95.6% success.
We show that, for stylometric methods based on the most frequent words, we can do without translations.
The interplay between borrowing and word formation (in particular, derivation) is documented on the example of the suffixes -ismus and -ita,  which are listed among the most common suffixes in loan nouns in Czech.
They are both used to form abstract nouns but differ in many aspects.
The suffix -ismus combines with bases that form larger derivational families than those of -ita but still most nouns in -ita share their root with several other derivatives, too.
By analysing selected derivatives and their mutual relations across a large amount of derivational families, I demonstrate that the size and inner structure of derivational families can provide significant knowledge about the meaning of the formations analysed.
The meanings of the suffixes are described using patterns which involve the most relevant derivatives with explicitly marked derivational relations.
Using the patterns, it is possible to explain semantic nuances that have not been described with loan words in Czech so far.
Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (for Elitr LangTools workshop at Eurosai 2020)
The Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) tool allows you to search in documents in various languages, using your own language both to enter the search query as well as to display the search results, thanks to automated machine translation.
In the demo, you can search in audits and other documents published by the Czech and Belgian Supreme Audit Institutions.
The demo works in English, German, French and Czech.
This deliverable reports on the preparation of the LangTools workshop at EUROSAI Congress 2020, aimed at presenting NLP Technologies to supreme audit institution (SAI) representatives.
We present the THEaiTRE project, in which we are trying to computationally generate a theatre play script.
We present THEaiTRE, a starting research project aimed at automatic generation of theatre play scripts.
This paper reviews related work and drafts an approach we intend to follow.
We plan to adopt generative neural language models and hierarchical generation approaches, supported by summarization and machine translation methods, and complemented with a human-in-the-loop approach.
Multiple studies have probed representations emerging in neural networks trained for end-to-end NLP tasks and examined what word-level linguistic information may be encoded in the representations.
In classical probing, a classifier is trained on the representations to extract the target linguistic information.
However, there is a threat of the classifier simply memorizing the linguistic labels for individual words, instead of extracting the linguistic abstractions from the representations, thus reporting false positive results.
While considerable efforts have been made to minimize the memorization problem, the task of actually measuring the amount of memorization happening in the classifier has been understudied so far.
In our work, we propose a simple general method for measuring the memorization effect, based on a symmetric selection of comparable sets of test words seen versus unseen in training.
Our method can be used to explicitly quantify the amount of memorization happening in a probing setup, so that an adequate setup can be chosen and the results of the probing can be interpreted with a reliability estimate.
We exemplify this by showcasing our method on a case study of probing for part of speech in a trained neural machine translation encoder.
This paper presents the results of the WMT20
Metrics Shared Task.
Participants were asked
to score the outputs of the translation systems
competing in the WMT20 News Translation
Task with automatic metrics.
Ten research
groups submitted 27 metrics, four of which
are reference-less “metrics”.
In addition,
we computed five baseline metrics, including SENT BLEU, BLEU, TER and CHR F using the SacreBLEU scorer.
All metrics were evaluated on how well they correlate at the
system-, document- and segment-level with
the WMT20 official human scores.
We present an extensive analysis on influence
of reference translations on metric reliability,
how well automatic metrics score human trans-
lations, and we also flag major discrepancies
between metric and human scores when eval-
uating MT systems.
Finally, we investigate
whether we can use automatic metrics to flag
incorrect human ratings.
Reading comprehension is a well studied task, with huge training datasets in English.
This work focuses on building reading comprehension systems for Czech, without requiring any manually annotated Czech training data.
First of all, we automatically translated SQuAD 1.1 and SQuAD 2.0 datasets to Czech to create training and development data, which we release at http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3249.
We then trained and evaluated several BERT and XLM-RoBERTa baseline models.
However, our main focus lies in cross-lingual transfer models.
We report that a XLM-RoBERTa model trained on English data and evaluated on Czech achieves very competitive performance, only approximately 2 percent points worse than a model trained on the translated Czech data.
This result is extremely good, considering the fact that the model has not seen any Czech data during training.
The cross-lingual transfer approach is very flexible and provides a reading comprehension in any language, for which we have enough monolingual raw texts.
This paper presents the results of the shared
tasks from the 7th workshop on Asian transla­tion (WAT2020).
For the WAT2020, 20 teams
participated in the shared tasks and 14 teams
submitted their translation results for the hu­man evaluation.
We also received 12 research paper submissions out of which 7 were ac­cepted.
About 500 translation results were
submitted to the automatic evaluation server,
and selected submissions were manually eval­uated.
We describe the joint submission of the University of Edinburgh and Charles University, Prague, to the Czech/English track in the WMT 2020 Shared Task on News Translation.
Our fast and compact student models distill knowledge from a larger, slower teacher.
They are designed to offer a good trade-off between translation quality and inference efficiency.
On the WMT 2020 Czech-English test sets, they achieve translation speeds of over 700 whitespace-delimited source words per second on a single CPU thread, thus making neural translation feasible on consumer hardware without a GPU.
I present a way to leverage the stenographed recordings of the Czech parliament meetings for purposes of training a speech-to-text system.
The article presents a method for scraping the data, acquiring word-level alignment and selecting reliable parts of the imprecise transcript.
Finally, I present an ASR system trained on these and other data.
The practice of tattooing has been part of human culture since the dawn of history.
In this paper, despite the mentioned cultural shifts toward the voluntary nature and social acceptability of tattooing, we focus on some cases of tattooing as an involuntary “branding” practice, which is a historical form of exercising total physical control over one’s person, such as in the case of human slaves.
In terms of empirical material, our study is based on the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive.
Speech recognition and machine translation have made major progress over the past decades, providing practical systems to map one language sequence to another.
Although multiple modalities such as sound and video are becoming increasingly available, the state-of-the-art systems are inherently unimodal, in the sense that they take a single modality⁠—either speech or text⁠—as input.
Evidence from human learning suggests that additional modalities can provide disambiguating signals crucial for many language tasks.
Here, we describe the How2 dataset, a large, open-domain collection of videos with transcriptions and their translations.
We then show how this single dataset can be used to develop systems for a variety of language tasks and present a number of models meant as starting points.
Across tasks, we find that building multi-modal architectures that perform better than their unimodal counterpart remains a challenge.
This leaves plenty of room for the exploration of more advanced solutions that fully exploit the multi-modal nature of the How2 dataset, and the general direction of multimodal learning with other datasets as well.
Even though sentence-centric metrics are
used widely in machine translation evaluation,
document-level performance is at least equally
important for professional usage.
In this paper,
we bring attention to detailed document-level
evaluation focused on markables (expressions
bearing most of the document meaning) and
the negative impact of various markable error
phenomena on the translation.
For an annotation experiment of two phases,
we chose Czech and English documents translated
by systems submitted to WMT20 News
Translation Task.
These documents are from
the News, Audit and Lease domains.
We show
that the quality and also the kind of errors
varies significantly among the domains.
This
systematic variance is in contrast to the automatic
evaluation results.
We inspect which specific markables are problematic
for MT systems and conclude with an
analysis of the effect of markable error types
on the MT performance measured by humans
and automatic evaluation tools.
In this paper, we present our submission to
the Non-Native Speech Translation Task for
IWSLT 2020.
Our main contribution is a proposed speech recognition pipeline that consists of an acoustic model and a phoneme-to grapheme model.
As an intermediate representation, we utilize phonemes.
We demonstrate that the proposed pipeline surpasses
commercially used automatic speech recognition (ASR) and submit it into the ASR track.
We complement this ASR with off-the-shelf
MT systems to take part also in the speech
translation track.
The lecture deals with the relation of implicit discourse relations and other factors, such as their frequency, specificity of their semantics, and features signalling the meaning of implicit discourse relation (confrontation: word order, long and short forms of pronouns, accent; concession: intonation).
We present a large corpus of Czech parliament plenary sessions.
The corpus consists of approximately 1200 hours of speech data and corresponding text transcriptions.
The whole corpus has been segmented to short audio segments making it suitable for both training and evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.
The source language of the corpus is Czech, which makes it a valuable resource for future research as only a few public datasets are available in the Czech language.
We complement the data release with experiments of two baseline ASR systems trained on the presented data: the more traditional approach implemented in the Kaldi ASRtoolkit which combines hidden Markov models and deep neural networks (NN) and a modern ASR architecture implemented in Jaspertoolkit which uses deep NNs in an end-to-end fashion.
UDPipe 2 is an pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing of CoNLL-U files.
Trained models are provided for nearly all UD treebanks and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art.
UDPipe 2 is a free software under Mozilla Public License 2.0 and the linguistic models are free for non-commercial use and distributed under CC BY-NC-SA license, although for some models the original data used to create the model may impose additional licensing conditions.
We present our contribution to the EvaLatin shared task, which is the first evaluation campaign devoted to the evaluation of NLP tools for Latin.
We submitted a system based on UDPipe 2.0, one of the winners of the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task, The 2018 Shared Task on Extrinsic Parser Evaluation and SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared Task.
Our system places first by a wide margin both in lemmatization and POS tagging in the open modality, where additional supervised data is allowed, in which case we utilize all Universal Dependency Latin treebanks.
In the closed modality, where only the EvaLatin training data is allowed, our system achieves the best performance in lemmatization and in classical subtask of POS tagging, while reaching second place in cross-genre and cross-time settings.
In the ablation experiments, we also evaluate the influence of BERT and XLM-RoBERTa contextualized embeddings, and the treebank encodings of the different flavors of Latin treebanks.
We introduce a new symmetric metric (called θpos) that utilises the non-symmetric KLcpos3 metric (Rosa and Žabokrtský, 2015) to allow us to compare the annotation consistency between different annotated treebanks of a given language, when annotated under the same guidelines.
We can set a threshold for this new metric so that a pair of treebanks can be considered harmonious in their annotation consistency if θpos surpasses the threshold.
For the calculation of the threshold, we estimate the effects of (i) the size variation, and (ii) the genre variation in the considered pair of treebanks.
The estimations are based on data from treebanks of distinct language families, making the threshold less dependent on the properties of individual languages.
We demonstrate the utility of the proposed metric by listing the treebanks in Universal Dependencies version 2.5 (UDv2.5) (Zeman et al., 2019) data that are annotated consistently with other treebanks of the same language.
However, the metric could be used to assess inter-treebank annotation consistency under other (non-UD) annotation guidelines as well.
The Malach User Interface created for the needs of the Malach Center for Visual History makes several large collections and databases of oral history sources available for the research of 20th century history, with special attention to the issue of the Holocaust History.
Neural networks trained on natural language processing tasks capture syntax even though it is not provided as a supervision signal.
This indicates that syntactic analysis is essential to the understating of language in artificial intelligence systems.
This overview paper covers approaches of evaluating the amount of syntactic information included in the representations of words for different neural network architectures.
We mainly summarize research on English monolingual data on language modeling tasks and multilingual data for neural machine translation systems and multilingual language models.
We describe which pre-trained models and representations of language are best suited for transfer to syntactic tasks.
This work focuses on analyzing the form and extent of syntactic abstraction captured by BERT by extracting labeled dependency trees from self-attentions.
Previous work showed that individual BERT heads tend to encode particular dependency relation types.
We extend these findings by explicitly comparing BERT relations to Universal Dependencies (UD) annotations, showing that they often do not match one-to-one.
We suggest a method for relation identification and syntactic tree construction.
Our approach produces significantly more consistent dependency trees than previous work, showing that it better explains the syntactic abstractions in BERT.
At the same time, it can be successfully applied with only a minimal amount of supervision and generalizes well across languages.
The presentation wis devoted to the current discourse-oriented projects/research directions at ÚFAL institute in connection with the implicitness of discourse relations, such as underspecified connectives or semantic signalling.
CzeDLex 0.7 is the third development version of a lexicon of Czech discourse connectives.
The lexicon contains connectives partially automatically extracted from the Prague Discourse Treebank 2.0 (PDiT 2.0) and other resources.
The most frequent entries in the lexicon (covering more than 95% of the discourse relations annotated in the PDiT 2.0) have been manually checked, translated to English and supplemented with additional linguistic information.
Existing models of multilingual sentence embeddings require large parallel data resources which are not available for low-resource languages.
We propose a novel unsupervised method to derive multilingual sentence embeddings relying only on monolingual data.
We first produce a synthetic parallel corpus using unsupervised machine translation, and use it to fine-tune a pretrained cross-lingual masked language model (XLM) to derive the multilingual sentence representations.
The quality of the representations is evaluated on two parallel corpus mining tasks with improvements of up to 22 F1 points over vanilla XLM.
In addition, we observe that a single synthetic bilingual corpus is able to improve results for other language pairs.
This paper presents a description of CUNI systems submitted to the WMT20 task on unsupervised and very low-resource supervised machine translation between German and Upper Sorbian.
We experimented with training on synthetic data and pre-training on a related language pair.
In the fully unsupervised scenario, we achieved 25.5 and 23.7 BLEU translating from and into Upper Sorbian, respectively.
Our low-resource systems relied on transfer learning from German-Czech parallel data and achieved 57.4 BLEU and 56.1 BLEU, which is an improvement of 10 BLEU points over the baseline trained only on the available small German-Upper Sorbian parallel corpus.
Multilingual contextual embeddings, such as multilingual BERT (mBERT) and XLM-RoBERTa, have proved useful for many multi-lingual tasks.
Previous work probed the cross-linguality of the representations indirectly using zero-shot transfer learning on morphological and syntactic tasks.
We instead focus on the language-neutrality of mBERT with respect to lexical semantics.
Our results show that contextual embeddings are more language-neutral and in general more informative than aligned static word-type embeddings which are explicitly trained for language neutrality.
Contextual embeddings are still by default only moderately language-neutral, however, we show two simple methods for achieving stronger language neutrality: first, by unsupervised centering of the representation for languages, and second by fitting an explicit projection on small parallel data.
In addition, we show how to reach state-of-the-art accuracy on language identification and word alignment in parallel sentences.
We present our submission to the Simultaneous Translation And Paraphrase for Language Education (STAPLE) challenge.
We used a standard Transformer model for translation, with a crosslingual classifier predicting correct translations on the output n-best list.
To increase the diversity of the outputs, we used additional data to train the translation model, and we trained a paraphrasing model based on the Levenshtein Transformer architecture to generate further synonymous translations.
The paraphrasing results were again filtered using our classifier.
While the use of additional data and our classifier filter were able to improve results, the paraphrasing model produced too many invalid outputs to further improve the output quality.
Our model without the paraphrasing component finished in the middle of the field for the shared task, improving over the best baseline by a margin of 10-22 % weighted F1 absolute.
We present our systems for the WMT20 Very Low Resource MT Task for translation between German and Upper Sorbian.
For training our systems, we generate synthetic data by both back- and forward-translation.
Additionally, we enrich the training data with German-Czech translated from Czech to Upper Sorbian by an unsupervised statistical MT system incorporating orthographically similar word pairs and transliterations of OOV words.
Our best translation system between German and Sorbian is based on transfer learning from a Czech-German system and scores 12 to 13 BLEU higher than a baseline system built using the available parallel data only.
We describe our two NMT systems submitted to the WMT 2020 shared task in English-Czech and English-Polish news translation.
One system is sentence level, translating each sentence independently.
The second system is document level, translating multiple sentences, trained on multi-sentence sequences up to 3000 characters long.
The quality of human translation was long thought to be unattainable for computer translation systems.
In this study, we present a deep-learning system, CUBBITT, which challenges this view.
In a context-aware blind evaluation by human judges, CUBBITT significantly outperformed professional-agency English-to-Czech news translation in preserving text meaning (translation adequacy).
While human translation is still rated as more fluent, CUBBITT is shown to be substantially more fluent than previous state-of-the-art systems.
Moreover, most participants of a Translation Turing test struggle to distinguish CUBBITT translations from human translations.
This work approaches the quality of human translation and even surpasses it in adequacy in certain circumstances.
This suggests that deep learning may have the potential to replace humans in applications where conservation of meaning is the primary aim.
This paper presents our progress towards deploying a versatile communication platform in the task of highly multilingual live speech
translation for conferences and remote meetings live subtitling.
The platform has been designed with a focus on very low latency and
high flexibility while allowing research prototypes of speech and text processing tools to be easily connected, regardless of where they
physically run.
We outline our architecture solution and also briefly compare it with the ELG platform.
Technical details are provided
on the most important components and we summarize the test deployment events we ran so far.
The aim of the paper is to introduce a Czech-German dictionary database containing frequently used language expressions involved in the text structure – anaphoric discourse connectives.
We present EVALD applications (Evaluator of Discourse) for automated essay scoring.
We analyze in detail newly acquired language data – texts written by non-native speakers reaching the threshold level of the Czech language acquisition.
We also present new spelling features added in the system.
GeCzLex - Lexicon of Czech and German Anaphoric Connectives  - is a translation equivalent database of Czech and German discourse connectives, based on the data of annotated corpora and lexicons: Prague Discourse Treebank 2.0 and CzeDLex 0.6 (for Czech), DiMLex 2.0 (for German) and Intercorp 11 (a large resource of parallel Czech - German texts).
Its current, first release is a pilot version representing one of the outcomes of a research project on anaphoricity in Czech and German connectives.
Thus, it contains translation equivalents for a) connectives originally formed from a preposition and an anaphoric element (e.g.
"darum" in German, "proto" in Czech) and b) Czech connectives with the ability to relate "remotely" to non-adjacent text segments.
This paper describes the Idiap submission
to WAT 2019 for the English-Hindi MultiModal Translation Task.
We have used
the state-of-the-art Transformer model and
utilized the IITB English-Hindi parallel corpus as an additional data source.
Among the different tracks of the multimodal task, we have participated in the
“Text-Only” track for the evaluation and
challenge test sets.
Our submission tops in
its track among the competitors in terms
of both automatic and manual evaluation.
Based on automatic scores, our text-only
submission also outperforms systems that
consider visual information in the “multimodal translation” task.
Visual Genome is a dataset connecting
structured image information with English language.
We present “Hindi Visual Genome”, a multi-modal dataset consisting of text and images suitable for English-Hindi multi-modal machine translation task and multi-modal research.
We have selected short English segments
(captions) from Visual Genome along with the associated images and automatically translated them to Hindi.
A careful manual post-editing followed which took the associated images into account.
We inspect the multi-head self-attention in Transformer NMT encoders for three source languages, looking for patterns that could have a syntactic interpretation.
In many of the attention heads, we frequently find sequences of consecutive states attending to the same position, which resemble syntactic phrases.
We propose a transparent deterministic method of quantifying the amount of syntactic information present in the self-attentions, based on automatically building and evaluating phrase-structure trees from the phrase-like sequences.
We compare the resulting trees to existing constituency treebanks, both manually and by computing precision and recall.
Word embeddings and Deep neural networks perform great.
They do not have any explicit knowledge of linguistic abstractions.
How do they work?
What emergent abstractions can we observe in them?
How can we interpret them?
Are the emergent structures and abstractions similar to classical linguistic structures and abstractions?
In this  work, we conduct a study on Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for English-Indonesian (EN-ID) and Indonesian-English (ID-EN).
We focus on spoken language domains, namely colloquial and speech languages.
We build NMT systems using the Transformer model for both translation directions and implement domain adaptation, in which we train our pre-trained NMT systems on speech language (in-domain) data.
Moreover, we conduct an evaluation on how the domain-adaptation method in our EN-ID system can result in more formal translation out-puts.
Neural natural language generation (NNLG) systems are known for their pathological outputs, i.e.
generating text which is unrelated to the input specification.
In this paper, we show the impact of semantic noise on state-of-the-art NNLG models which implement different semantic control mechanisms.
We find that cleaned data can improve semantic correctness by up to 97%, while maintaining fluency.
We also find that the most common error is omitting information, rather than hallucination.
We present a recurrent neural network based system for automatic quality estimation of natural language generation (NLG) outputs, which jointly learns to assign numerical ratings to individual outputs and to provide pairwise rankings of two different outputs.
The latter is trained using pairwise hinge loss over scores from two copies of the rating network.
We use learning to rank and synthetic data to improve the quality of ratings assigned by our system: we synthesise training pairs of distorted system outputs and train the system to rank the less distorted one higher.
This leads to a 12% increase in correlation with human ratings over the previous benchmark.
We also establish the state of the art on the dataset of relative rankings from the E2E NLG Challenge (Dušek et al., 2019), where synthetic data lead to a 4% accuracy increase over the base model.
We present the first dataset targeted at end-to-end NLG in Czech in the restaurant domain, along with several strong baseline models using the sequence-to-sequence approach.
While non-English NLG is under-explored in general, Czech, as a morphologically rich language, makes the task even harder: Since Czech requires inflecting named entities, delexicalization or copy mechanisms do not work out-of-the-box and lexicalizing the generated outputs is non-trivial.
In our experiments, we present two different approaches to this problem: (1) using a neural language model to select the correct inflected form while lexicalizing, (2) a two-step generation setup: our sequence-to-sequence model generates an interleaved sequence of lemmas and morphological tags, which are then inflected by a morphological generator.
This paper presents the results of the premier
shared task organized alongside the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) 2019.
Participants were asked to build machine
translation systems for any of 18 language
pairs, to be evaluated on a test set of news
stories.
The main metric for this task is human judgment of translation quality.
The task
was also opened up to additional test suites to
probe specific aspects of translation.
This paper presents the results of the
WMT19 Metrics Shared Task.
Participants were asked to score the outputs of the translations systems competing in the WMT19 News Translation
Task with automatic metrics.
13 research
groups submitted 24 metrics, 10 of which
are reference-less “metrics” and constitute
submissions to the joint task with WMT19
Quality Estimation Task, “QE as a Metric”.
In addition, we computed 11 baseline
metrics, with 8 commonly applied baselines (BLEU, SentBLEU, NIST, WER,
PER, TER, CDER, and chrF) and 3 reimplementations (chrF+, sacreBLEU-BLEU,
and sacreBLEU-chrF).
Metrics were evaluated on the system level, how well a given
metric correlates with the WMT19 official manual ranking, and segment level,
how well the metric correlates with human
judgements of segment quality.
This year,
we use direct assessment (DA) as our only
form of manual evaluation.
Reflexives in Czech are highly ambiguous.
In this contribution, changes in valency of derived reflexive verbs have been discussed.
The 2019 Shared Task at the Conference for Computational Language Learning (CoNLL) was devoted to Meaning Representation Parsing (MRP) across frameworks.
Five distinct approaches to the representation of sentence meaning in the form of directed graph were represented in the training and evaluation data for the task, packaged in a uniform abstract graph representation and serialization.
The task received submissions from eighteen teams, of which five do not participate in the official ranking because they arrived after the closing deadline, made use of additional training data, or involved one of the task co-organizers.
All technical information regarding the task, including system submissions, official results, and links to supporting resources and software are available from the task web site at: http://mrp.nlpl.eu.
We propose two neural network architectures for nested named entity recognition (NER), a setting in which named entities may overlap and also be labeled with more than one label.
We encode the nested labels using a linearized scheme.
In our first proposed approach, the nested labels are modeled as multilabels corresponding to the Cartesian product of the nested labels in a standard LSTM-CRF architecture.
In the second one, the nested NER is viewed as a sequence-to-sequence problem, in which the input sequence consists of the tokens and output sequence of the labels, using hard attention on the word whose label is being predicted.
The proposed methods outperform
the nested NER state of the art on four corpora: ACE-2004, ACE-2005, GENIA and Czech CNEC.
We also enrich our architectures with the recently published contextual embeddings: ELMo, BERT and Flair, reaching further improvements for the four nested entity corpora.
In addition, we report flat NER state-of-the-art results for CoNLL-2002 Dutch and Spanish and for CoNLL-2003 English.
Neural machine translation is known to require large numbers of parallel training sentences, which generally prevent it from excelling on low-resource language pairs.
This thesis explores the use of cross-lingual transfer learning on
neural networks as a way of solving the problem with the lack of resources.
We
propose several transfer learning approaches to reuse a model pretrained on a
high-resource language pair.
We pay particular attention to the simplicity of
the techniques.
We study two scenarios: (a) when we reuse the high-resource
model without any prior modifications to its training process and (b) when we
can prepare the first-stage high-resource model for transfer learning in advance.
For the former scenario, we present a proof-of-concept method by reusing a
model trained by other researchers.
In the latter scenario, we present a method
which reaches even larger improvements in translation performance.
Apart
from proposed techniques, we focus on an in-depth analysis of transfer learning
techniques and try to shed some light on transfer learning improvements.
We
show how our techniques address specific problems of low-resource languages
and are suitable even in high-resource transfer learning.
We evaluate the potential drawbacks and behavior by studying transfer learning in various situations,
for example, under artificially damaged training corpora, or with fixed various
model parts.
This tutorial will show you how to use the Tensor2Tensor and how to apply Transfer Learning to low-resource languages.
It should be easy to follow for everyone, even people that never trained Machine Translation models.
This paper describes the CUNI submission
to the WMT 2019 News Translation Shared
Task for the low-resource languages: GujaratiEnglish and Kazakh-English.
We participated
in both language pairs in both translation directions.
Our system combines transfer learning from a different high-resource language
pair followed by training on backtranslated
monolingual data.
Thanks to the simultaneous training in both directions, we can iterate
the backtranslation process.
We are using the
Transformer model in a constrained submission.
In this article we provide an overview of first-hand experiences and vantage points for best practices from projects in seven European countries dedicated to learner corpus research (LCR) and the creation of language learner corpora.
The corpora and tools involved in LCR are becoming more and more important, as are careful preparation and easy retrieval and reusability of corpora and tools.
But the lack of commonly agreed solutions for many aspects of LCR, interoperability between learner corpora and the exchange of data from different learner corpus projects remains a challenge.
We show how concepts like metadata, anonymization, error taxonomies and linguistic annotations as well as tools, toolchains and data formats can be individually challenging and how the challenges can be solved.
Many linguistic theories and annotation frameworks contain a deep-syntactic and/or semantic layer.
While many of these frameworks have been applied to more than one language, none of them is anywhere near the number of languages that are covered in Universal Dependencies (UD).
In this paper, we present a prototype of Deep Universal Dependencies, a two-speed concept where minimal deep annotation can be derived automatically from surface UD trees, while richer annotation can be added for datasets where appropriate resources are available.
We release the Deep UD data in Lindat.
We present UDify, a multilingual multi-task model capable of accurately predicting universal part-of-speech, morphological features, lemmas, and dependency trees simultaneously for all 124 Universal Dependencies treebanks across 75 languages.
By leveraging a multilingual BERT self-attention model pretrained on 104 languages, we found that fine-tuning it on all datasets concatenated together with simple softmax classifiers for each UD task can result in state-of-the-art UPOS, UFeats, Lemmas, UAS, and LAS scores, without requiring any recurrent or language-specific components.
We evaluate UDify for multilingual learning, showing that low-resource languages benefit the most from cross-linguistic annotations.
We also evaluate for zero-shot learning, with results suggesting that multilingual training provides strong UD predictions even for languages that neither UDify nor BERT have ever been trained on.
Code for UDify is available at https://github.com/hyperparticle/udify.
Recent developments in machine translation experiment with the idea that a model can
improve the translation quality by performing multiple tasks, e.g., translating from source to
target and also labeling each source word with syntactic information.
The intuition is that the
network would generalize knowledge over the multiple tasks, improving the translation performance, especially in low resource conditions.
We devised an experiment that casts doubt on
this intuition.
We perform similar experiments in both multi-decoder and interleaving setups
that label each target word either with a syntactic tag or a completely random tag.
Surprisingly, we show that the model performs nearly as well on uncorrelated random tags as on true
syntactic tags.
We hint some possible explanations of this behavior.
The main message from our article is that experimental results with deep neural networks
should always be complemented with trivial baselines to document that the observed gain is
not due to some unrelated properties of the system or training effects.
True confidence in where
the gains come from will probably remain problematic anyway.
In contemporary society, social justice issues are often related to documentary video clips and their interpretation.
Understanding the ways of working with and around video in everyday settings could provide novel perspectives on traditional themes.
This paper is based on an ethnomethodological study of videotaped episodes of students’ collaborative work with on-line material constructed from texts, images and video clip fragments of oral history interviews.
Students worked with a single computer device and one paper sheet in small groups of two or three.
The temporal organization of classroom work with digital oral history in this classroom setting is divided to three phases: (1) preparation for watching the video clip, which requires the establishment of an optimal arrangement of material artifacts and participants’ bodily orientations; (2) watching the video clip, which points to a preference for uninterrupted watching from start to end, as well as limitation of participants’ talk to "running commentary"; (3) reflecting the video clip, which shows orientation to the formulation of required answer and its collaborative writing into the paper sheet, including occasional second watching.
In order to use audiovisual oral history (OH) materials efficiently and meaningfully, it is important to understand how people make sense of such video recordings in social interaction.
Fundamental questions thus emerge in regard to secondary analysis and practical utilization of archived audiovisual OH material, such as: What are the features of OH interview as a social object?
What makes it meaningful and interpretable?
How much do we need to know about the socially situated character of the interview in order to understand it properly?
Is there “too little” or “too much” context in relation to OH?
How do people make sense of OH interviews in social practice, and relate it to their broader historical knowledge?
In the workshop, we will grasp such far-reaching questions from a very empirical and practical perspective.
We are reaching out to scholars who are interested in cross-disciplinary approaches and work with interviews, oral history, and digitized or digital qualitative data in general.
This paper describes a machine translation test set of documents from the auditing domain and its use as one of the “test suites” in the WMT19 News Translation Task for translation directions involving Czech, English and German.
Our evaluation suggests that current MT systems optimized for the general news domain can perform quite well even in the particular domain of audit reports.
The detailed manual evaluation however indicates that deep factual knowledge of the domain is necessary.
For the naked eye of a non-expert, translations by many systems seem almost perfect and automatic MT evaluation with one reference is practically useless for considering these details.
Furthermore, we show on a sample document from the domain of agreements that even the best systems completely fail in preserving the semantics of the agreement, namely the identity of the parties.
CzeDLex 0.6 is the second development version of a lexicon of Czech discourse connectives.
The lexicon contains connectives partially automatically extracted from the Prague Discourse Treebank 2.0 (PDiT 2.0), a large corpus annotated manually with discourse relations.
The most frequent entries in the lexicon (covering more than 90% of the discourse relations annotated in the PDiT 2.0) have been manually checked, translated to English and supplemented with additional linguistic information.
This paper deals with the neglected issue of the valency of adverbs.
After providing a brief theoretical background, a procedure is presented of extracting the list of potentially valent adverbs from two syntactically parsed corpora of Czech, SYN2015 and PDT.
Taking note of the methodological and theoretical problems surrounding this task, especially those relating to the fuzzy boundaries of word classes, we outline the types of adverbs identified as having valency properties.
Where appropriate, we comment on – and occasionally suggest improvements in – the lexicographic treatment of valent adverbs.
DeriNet is a large linguistic resource containing over 1 million lexemes of Czech connected by
almost 810 thousand links that correspond to derivational relations.
In the previous version,
DeriNet 1.7, it only contained very sparse annotations of features other than derivations – it listed
the lemma and part-of-speech category of each lexeme and since version 1.5, a true/false flag
with lexemes created by compounding.
The paper presents an extended version of this network, labelled DeriNet 2.0, which adds a number
of features, namely annotation of morphological categories (aspect, gender and animacy) with all
lexemes in the database, identification of root morphemes in 250 thousand lexemes, annotation
of five semantic labels (diminutive, possessive, female, iterative, and aspect) with 150 thousand
derivational relations, a pilot annotation of parents of compounds, and another pilot annotation
of so-called fictitious lexemes, which connect related derivational families without a common
synchronous parent.
The new pieces of annotation could be added thanks to a new file format
for storing the network, which aims to be general and extensible, and therefore possibly usable to
other similar projects.
The development and use of language resources often involve the processing of personal data.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) establishes an EU-wide framework for the processing of personal data for research purposes while at the same time allowing for some flexibility on the part of the Member States.
The paper discusses the legal framework for lan- guage research following the entry into force of the GDPR.
In the first section, we present some fundamental concepts of data protection relevant to language research.
In the second section, the general framework of processing personal data for research purposes is discussed.
In the last section, we focus on the models that certain EU Member States use to regulate data processing for research purposes.
ITAT (Information Technologies—Applications and Theory) is a traditional Czecho-Slovak conference gathering scientists and experts working within a broad scope of computer science.
ITAT not only offers a possibility to exchange ideas and information, it also emphasizes informal communication and discussions among participants.
We present an introductory investigation into continuous-space vector
representations of sentences.
We acquire pairs of very similar sentences
differing only by a small alterations (such as change of a noun, adding
an adjective, noun or punctuation) from datasets for natural language
inference using a simple pattern method.
We look into how such a small
change within the sentence text affects its representation in the continuous
space and how such alterations are reflected by some of the popular sentence
embedding models.
We found that vector differences of some embeddings
actually reflect small changes within a sentence.
We present a test collection for medical cross-lingual information retrieval.
It is built on resources used by the CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2013–2015 in the patient-centered information retrieval tasks and greatly improves applicability and reusability of the official data.
The document set is identical to the official one used for the task in 2015 and contains about 1 million English medical webpages.
The query set consists of 166 queries used during the three years of the campaign as test queries, now available in eight languages (the original English and human translations into Czech, French, German, Hungarian, Polish, Spanish and Swedish).
The extended test collection provides extensively improved relevance judgements which almost doubled the amount of the officially assessed query-document pairs.
This paper describes the content of the extended version of the test collection, details of query translation and relevance assessment, and state-of-the-art results on this collection.
The dataset can be obtained publicly in the following url: https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2925
We present a method for automatic query expansion for cross-lingual information retrieval in the medical domain.
The method employs machine translation of source-language queries into a document language and linear regression to predict the retrieval performance for each translated query when expanded with a candidate term.
Candidate terms (in the document language) come from multiple sources: query translation hypotheses obtained from the machine translation system, Wikipedia articles and PubMed abstracts.
Query expansion is applied only when the model predicts a score for a candidate term that exceeds a tuned threshold which allows to expand queries with strongly related terms only.
Our experiments are conducted using the CLEF eHealth 2013–2015 test collection and show significant improvements in both cross-lingual and monolingual settings.
In this paper we compare structure of Czech word embeddings for English-Czech neural machine translation (NMT), word2vec and sentiment analysis.
We show that although it is possible to successfully predict part of speech (POS) tags from word embeddings of word2vec and various translation models, not all of the embedding spaces show the same structure.
The information about POS is present in word2vec embeddings, but the high degree of organization by POS in the NMT decoder suggests that this information is more important for machine translation and therefore the NMT model represents it in more direct way.
Our method is based on correlation of principal component analysis (PCA) dimensions with categorical linguistic data.
We also show that further examining histograms of classes along the principal component is important to understand the structure of representation of information in embeddings.
This paper describes a weighted finite-state
morphological transducer for Crimean Tatar able to analyse and generate in both Latin and Cyrillic orthographies.
This transducer was developed by a team including a community member and language expert, a field linguist who works with the community, a Turkologist with computational linguistics expertise, and an experienced computational linguist with Turkic expertise.
This paper serves as a short overview of the JNLE special issue on representation of the meaning of the sentence, bringing together traditional symbolic and modern continuous approaches.
We indicate notable aspects of sentence meaning and their compatibility with the two streams of research and then summarize the papers selected for this special issue.
We present two case studies that demonstrate that co-habitation of various (sub)disciplines of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Pro-cessing can reach novel findings and help the advancement of the field(s).
One example covers a study of synonymy by searching for information in different lexical resources with regard to multilinguality, and the other demonstrates on the study of some phenomena concerning information structure and word order in English and Czech how a parallel multilingual and/or multilayered corpus if properly annotated can be used for a study of some aspects of the deep syntactic structure.
Both cases support our convic-tion that the creation of language resources is a fundamental step in the do-main of computational linguistics, that well-founded annotation is an im-portant step forward towards both testing the original linguistic theory and developing it further.
Obituary of Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday with special attention on his connection with the Prague scholars.
Data from a parallel annotated English–Czech corpus serve for testing the variability of the mutual position of LOC and TWHEN in Czech and English and for the analysis of the relation between information structure and the given order in the two languages.
Based on the Praguian theory of Topic/Focus Articulation and using a parallel English–Czech corpus, we have followed two research questions: (i) How far does the assignment of Focus proper agree in English and in Czech, (ii) If the assignment of Focus proper differs, is the Focus-proper element in English at least a member of the (global) Focus of the Czech sentence?
We present a software solution for and experience in running a digital repository for language data and natural language processing tools - LINDAT/CLARIN.
We will present unique support for licensing with an emphasis on Open Access, and how we support all 4 key FAIR principles.
We will show the submission workflow including license choice, approval and publishing or submissions by editors, as well as the repository administration environment including license definition, signing and access control.
We will also present repository integration with other services, and statistics of operation.
Přehled posledních výsledků ve výkzumu multilingválního vyhledávání v oblasti zdraví.
An overview talk on the topic of cross-lingual information retrieval.
This paper focuses on Semantic Roles, an important component of
studies in lexical semantics, as they are captured as part of a bilingual (Czech-
English) synonym lexicon called CzEngClass.
This lexicon builds upon the
existing valency lexicons included within the framework of the annotation of
the various Prague Dependency Treebanks.
The present analysis of Semantic
Roles is being approached from the Functional Generative Description point of
view and supported by the textual evidence taken specifically from the Prague
Czech-English Dependency Treebank.
In order to describe non-systemic valency behavior of Czech deverbal nouns, we present results of an automatic comparison of valency frames of interlinked noun and verbal lexical units included in valency lexicons NomVallex
and VALLEX.
We show that the non-systemic valency behavior of the nouns is mostly manifested by non-systemic forms of their actants, while changes in the number or type of adnominal actants are negligible as for their frequency.
Non-systemic forms considerably contribute to a general increase in the number of forms in valency frames of nouns compared to the number of forms in valency frames of their base verbs.
The non-systemic forms are more frequent in valency frames of non-productively derived nouns than in valency frames of productively derived ones.
The data of the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank (a member of the family of Prague Dependency Treebanks) have served as a basis for the comparative study of delimiting adverbial meanings of the local relation “within the given place”.
The Czech prepositional groups containing the prepositions v, na, and u with the above meaning are compared with their English equivalents, using a more subtle differentiation into three semantic subgroups of "inside", "on the surface" and "at the given place".
Our analysis confirms that though every language structures the reality in a different way, certain tendencies may be observed in the relation of the forms and their functions that eventually result in a more detailed classification.
The contribution presents results of an ongoing work.
We describe systematic changes that have been made to the Czech morphological dictionary related to annotating new data within the project of Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT).
We bring new solutions to several complicated morphological features that occur in Czech texts.
We introduced two new parts of speech, namely foreign word and segment.
We adopted new principles for morphological analysis of global and inflectional variants, homonymous lemmas, abbreviations and aggregates.
The changes were initiated by the need of consistency between the data and the dictionary and of the dictionary itself.
The paper focuses on how loan verbal neologisms form their aspectual counterpart in Czech, either by changing the thematic suffix in a simplex verb, or by deriving a prefixed verb.
The main hypothesis is that the formation of aspectual pairs is determined by whether the neologism is interpreted as having either a verbal base, or a noun base.
The paper describes a semi-automatic procedure introducing semantic labels into the DeriNet network, which is a large, freely available resource modelling derivational relations in the lexicon of Czech.
The data
were assigned labels corresponding to five semantic categories (diminutives, possessives, female nouns, iteratives, and aspectual meanings) by a machine learning model, which achieved excellent results in terms of both precision and recall.
We present a proposal for a project for automatic generation of theatre play scripts.
We suggest a hierarchical generation scenario based on text expansion (an inverse of text summarization), iteratively expanding the title of the play until the whole script is generated.
We review the challenges of the project and solutions that we envision for them.
Similarly to other fields, Natural language processing has recently been
revolutionized by the introduction of Deep learning.
In my talk, I will
focus on two specific properties of natural text as input to a machine
learning system, and the current ways in which these are addressed in
Deep neural networks:
- Representing massively multi-valued discrete data (words) by
continuous low-dimensional vectors (word embeddings).
- Handling variable-length input sequences with long-distance relations
between elements (sentences) by fixed-sized neural units (attention
mechanisms).
CoNLL 2018 Shared Task Team CUNI-x-ling -- source codes for a competition in multilingual parsing
We investigate to what extent inflection can be automatically separated from derivation, just based
on the word forms.
We expect pairs of inflected forms of the same lemma to be closer to each other
than pairs of inflected forms of two different lemmas (still derived from a same root, though),
given a proper distance measure.
We estimate distances of word forms using edit distance, which
represents character-based similarity, and word embedding similarity, which serves as a proxy
to meaning similarity.
Specifically, we explore Levenshtein and Jaro-Winkler edit distances, and
cosine similarity of FastText word embeddings.
We evaluate the separability of inflection and
derivation on a sample from DeriNet, a database of word formation relations in Czech.
We
investigate the word distance measures directly, as well as embedded in a clustering setup.
Best
results are achieved by using a combination of Jaro-Winkler edit distance and word embedding
cosine similarity, outperforming each of the individual measures.
Further analysis shows that the
method works better for some classes of inflections and derivations than for others, revealing some
limitations of the method, but also supporting the idea of replacing a binary inflection-derivation
dichotomy with a continuous scale.
We focus on the task of unsupervised lemmatization, i.e.
grouping together inflected forms of one word under one label (a lemma) without the use of annotated training data.
We propose to perform agglomerative clustering of word forms with a novel distance measure.
Our distance measure is based on the observation that inflections of the same word tend to be similar both string-wise and in meaning.
We therefore combine word embedding cosine similarity, serving as a proxy to the meaning similarity, with Jaro-Winkler edit distance.
Our experiments on 23 languages show our approach to be promising, surpassing the baseline on 23 of the 28 evaluation datasets.
Introduction of the research of automatic coherence evaluation in Czech using unlabeled large data.
We use large unlabeled data (n-gram model, density estimates of features) to improve quality of surface coherence evaluation in Czech texts.
Along with new features across layers of language description, the additions significantly improve the performance of the system.
In this paper, we describe our systems submitted to the Building Educational Applications (BEA) 2019 Shared Task (Bryant et al., 2019).
We participated in all three tracks.
Our models are NMT systems based on the Transformer model, which we improve by incorporating several enhancements: applying dropout to whole source and target words, weighting target subwords, averaging model checkpoints, and using the trained model iteratively for correcting the intermediate translations.
The system in the Restricted Track is trained on the provided corpora with oversampled "cleaner" sentences and reaches 59.39 F0.5 score on the test set.
The system in the Low-Resource Track is trained from Wikipedia revision histories and reaches 44.13 F0.5 score.
Finally, we finetune the system from the Low-Resource Track on restricted data and achieve 64.55 F0.5 score, placing third in the Unrestricted Track.
Grammatical error correction in English is a long studied problem with many existing systems and datasets.
However, there has been only a limited research on error correction of other languages.
In this paper, we present a new dataset AKCES-GEC on grammatical error correction for Czech.
We then make experiments on Czech, German and Russian and show that when utilizing synthetic parallel corpus, Transformer neural machine translation model can reach new state-of-the-art results on these datasets.
AKCES-GEC is published under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license at https://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-3057 and the source code of the GEC model is available at https://github.com/ufal/low-resource-gec-wnut2019.
This paper presents the results of the
shared tasks from the 6th workshop on
Asian translation (WAT2019) including
Ja↔En, Ja↔Zh scientific paper translation subtasks, Ja↔En, Ja↔Ko, Ja↔En
patent translation subtasks, Hi↔En,
My↔En, Km↔En, Ta↔En mixed domain
subtasks, Ru↔Ja news commentary
translation task, and En→Hi multi-modal
translation task.
For the WAT2019, 25
teams participated in the shared tasks.
We also received 10 research paper submissions out of which 71 were accepted.
About 400 translation results were submitted to the automatic evaluation server,
and selected submissions were manually
evaluated.
Using data-driven models for solving text summarization or similar tasks has become very common in the last years.
Yet most of the studies report basic accuracy scores only, and nothing is known about the ability of the proposed models to improve when trained on more data.
In this paper, we define and propose three data efficiency metrics: data score efficiency, data time deficiency and overall data efficiency.
We also propose a simple scheme that uses those metrics and apply it for a more comprehensive evaluation of popular methods on text summarization and title generation tasks.
For the latter task, we process and release a huge collection of 35 million abstract-title pairs from scientific articles.
Our results reveal that among the tested models, the Transformer is the most efficient on both tasks.
Authors' keyphrases assigned to scientific articles are essential for recognizing content and topic aspects.
Most of the proposed supervised and unsupervised methods for keyphrase generation are unable to produce terms that are valuable but do not appear in the text.
In this paper, we explore the possibility of considering the keyphrase string as an abstractive summary of the title and the abstract.
First, we collect, process and release a large dataset of scientific paper metadata that contains 2.2 million records.
Then we experiment with popular text summarization neural architectures.
Despite using advanced deep learning models, large quantities of training data and many days of computation, our systematic evaluation on four test datasets reveals that the explored text summarization methods could not produce better keyphrases than the much simpler unsupervised methods or the existing supervised ones.
In the area of online communication, commerce and transactions, analyzing sentiment polarity of texts written in various natural languages has become crucial.
While there have been a lot of contributions in resources and studies for the English language, "smaller" languages like Czech have not received much attention.
In this survey, we explore the effectiveness of many existing machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis of Czech Facebook posts and product reviews.
We report the sets of optimal parameter values for each algorithm and the scores in both datasets.
We finally observe that support vector machines are the best classifier and efforts to increase performance even more with bagging, boosting or voting ensemble schemes fail to do so.
In this paper, we study abstractive summarization for open-domain videos.
Unlike the traditional text news summarization, the goal is less to "compress" text information but rather to provide a fluent textual summary of information that has been collected and fused from different source modalities, in our case video and audio transcripts (or text).
We show how a multi-source sequence-to-sequence model with hierarchical attention can integrate information from different modalities into a coherent output, compare various models trained with different modalities and present pilot experiments on the How2 corpus of instructional videos.
We also propose a new evaluation metric (Content F1) for abstractive summarization task that measures semantic adequacy rather than fluency of the summaries, which is covered by metrics like ROUGE and BLEU.
We introduce an experimental probe comparing how texts written by non-native speakers of Czech are evaluated by a software application EVALD and by teachers of Czech as a foreign language.
We present the first complete spoken dialogue system driven by a multiimensional statistical dialogue manager.
This framework has been shown to substantially reduce data needs by leveraging domain-independent dimensions, such as social obligations or feedback, which (as we show) can be transferred between domains.
In this paper, we conduct a user study and show that the performance of a multi-dimensional system, which can be adapted from a source domain, is equivalent to that of a one-dimensional baseline, which can only be trained from scratch.
The lecture presents the results of the annotation of implicit relations in Czech based on the PDiT-EDA 1.0 corpus.
It focuses on the distribution of implicit and explicit relations, their semantics, the presence of sentence negation and the relation of implicitness to the text genre.
We analyze some of the factors influencing the explicitness/implicitness of discourse relations, such as the text genre, semantic type of the discourse relation and the presence of negation in discourse arguments.
We present a system description of our contribution to the CoNLL 2019 shared task, Cross-
Framework Meaning Representation Parsing (MRP 2019).
The proposed architecture is our first attempt towards a semantic parsing extension of the UDPipe 2.0, a lemmatization, POS tagging and dependency parsing pipeline.
For the MRP 2019, which features five formally and linguistically different approaches to meaning representation (DM, PSD, EDS, UCCA and AMR), we propose a uniform, language and framework agnostic graph-to-graph neural network architecture.
Without any knowledge about the graph structure, and specifically without any linguistically or framework motivated features, our system implicitly models the meaning representation graphs.
After fixing a human error (we used earlier incorrect version of provided test set analyses),
our submission would score third in the competition evaluation.
The source code of our
system is available at https://github.
com/ufal/mrpipe-conll2019.
Contextualized embeddings, which capture appropriate word meaning depending on context, have recently been proposed.
We evaluate two methods for precomputing such embeddings, BERT and Flair, on four Czech text processing tasks: part-of-speech (POS) tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing and named entity recognition (NER).
The first three tasks, POS tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing, are evaluated on two corpora: the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.5 and the Universal Dependencies 2.3.
The named entity
recognition (NER) is evaluated on the Czech Named Entity Corpus 1.1 and 2.0.
We report state-of-the-art results for the above mentioned tasks and corpora.
We present an extensive evaluation of three recently proposed methods for contextualized embeddings on 89 corpora in 54 languages of the Universal Dependencies 2.3 in three tasks: POS tagging, lemmatization, and dependency parsing.
Employing the BERT, Flair and ELMo as pretrained embedding inputs in a strong baseline of UDPipe 2.0, one of the best-performing systems of the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task and an overall winner of the EPE 2018, we present a one-to-one comparison of the three contextualized word embedding methods, as well as a comparison with word2vec-like pretrained embeddings and with end-to-end character-level word embeddings.
We report state-of-the-art results in all three tasks as compared to results on UD 2.2 in the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task.
We present our contribution to the SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared Task: Crosslinguality and Context in Morphology, Task 2: contextual morphological analysis and lemmatization.
We submitted a modification of the UDPipe 2.0, one of best-performing systems of the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies and an overall winner of the The 2018 Shared Task on Extrinsic Parser Evaluation.
As our first improvement, we use the pretrained contextualized embeddings (BERT) as additional inputs to the network; secondly, we use individual morphological features as regularization; and finally, we merge the selected corpora of the same language.
In the lemmatization task, our system exceeds all the submitted systems by a wide margin with lemmatization accuracy 95.78 (second best was 95.00, third 94.46).
In the morphological analysis, our system placed tightly second: our morphological analysis accuracy was 93.19, the winning system’s 93.23.
Universal Derivations (UDer) is a collection of harmonized lexical networks capturing word-formation, especially derivational relations, in a cross-linguistically consistent annotation scheme for many languages.
The annotation scheme is based on a rooted tree data structure, in which nodes correspond to lexemes, while edges represent derivational relations or compounding.
The current version of the UDer collection contains eleven harmonized resources covering eleven different languages.
The aim of this paper is to open a discussion on harmonization of existing data resources related
to derivational morphology.
We present a newly assembled collection of eleven harmonized
resources named “Universal Derivations” (clearly being inspired by the success story of the
Universal Dependencies initiative in treebanking), as well as the harmonization process that
brings the individual resources under a unified annotation scheme.
The utility of linguistic annotation in neural machine translation seemed to had been established in past papers.
The experiments were however limited to recurrent sequence-to-sequence architectures and relatively small data settings.
We focus on the state-of-the-art Transformer model and use comparably larger corpora.
Specifically, we try to promote the knowledge of source-side syntax using multi-task learning either through simple data manipulation techniques or through a dedicated model component.
In particular, we train one
of Transformer attention heads to produce source-side dependency tree.
Overall, our results cast some doubt on the utility of multi-task setups with linguistic information.
The data manipulation techniques, recommended in previous works, prove ineffective in large data settings.
The treatment of self-attention as dependencies seems much more promising: it helps in translation and reveals that Transformer model can very easily grasp the syntactic structure.
An important but curious result is, however, that identical gains are obtained by using trivial ``linear trees'' instead of true dependencies.
The reason for the gain thus may not be coming from the added linguistic knowledge but from some simpler regularizing effect we induced on self-attention matrices.
We present our submission to the WMT19 Robustness Task.
Our baseline system is the CUNI Transformer system trained for the WMT18 shared task on News Translation.
Quantitative results show that the CUNI Transformer system is already far more robust to noisy input than the LSTM-based baseline provided by the task organizers.
We further improved the performance of our model by fine-tuning on the in-domain noisy data.
Filters of convolutional networks used in computer vision are often visualized as image patches that maximize the response of the filter.
We use the same approach to interpret weight matrices in simple architectures for natural language processing tasks.
We interpret a convolutional network for sentiment classification as word-based rules.
Using the rule, we recover the performance of the original model.
Multilingual BERT (mBERT) provides sentence representations for 104 languages, which are useful for many multi-lingual tasks.
Previous work probed the cross-linguality of mBERT using zero-shot transfer learning on morphological and syntactic tasks.
We instead focus on the semantic properties of mBERT.
We show that mBERT representations can be split into a language-specific component and a language-neutral component, and that the language-neutral component is sufficiently general in terms of modeling semantics to allow high-accuracy word-alignment and sentence retrieval but is not yet good enough for the more difficult task of MT quality estimation.
Our work presents interesting challenges which must be solved to build better language-neutral representations, particularly for tasks requiring linguistic transfer of semantics.
Word sense disambiguation is the task of assigning the correct sense of a polysemous word in the context in which it appears.
In recent years, word embeddings have been applied successfully to many NLP tasks.
Thanks to their ability to capture distributional semantics, more recent attention have been focused on utilizing word embeddings to disambiguate words.
In this paper, a novel unsupervised method is proposed to disambiguate words from the first language by deploying a trained word embeddings model of the second language using only a bilingual dictionary.
While the translated words are useful clues for the disambiguation process, the main idea of this work is to use the information provided by English-translated surrounding words to disambiguate Persian words using trained English word2vec; well-known word embeddings model.
Each translation of the polysemous word is compared against word embeddings of translated surrounding words to calculate word similarity scores and the most similar word to vectors of translated surrounding words is selected as the correct translation.
This method only requires a raw corpus and a bilingual dictionary to disambiguate the word under question.
The experimental results on a manually-created test dataset demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method.
The 2019 Shared Task on Automatic Gapping Resolution for Russian (AGRR2019) aims to tackle non-trivial linguistic phenomenon, gapping, that occurs in coordinated structures and elides a repeated predicate, typically
from the second clause.
In this paper, we define the task and evaluation metrics, provide detailed
information on data preparation, annotation schemes and methodology,
analyze the results and describe different approaches of the participating
solutions.
We describe our four NMT systems submitted to the IWSLT19 shared task in English→Czech text-to-text translation of TED talks.
The goal of this study is to understand the interactions between document-level NMT and domain adaptation.
All our systems are based on the Transformer model implemented in the Tensor2Tensor framework.
Two of the systems serve as baselines, which are not adapted to the TED talks domain: SENTBASE is trained on single sentences, DOCBASE on multi-sentence (document-level) sequences.
The other two submitted systems are adapted to TED talks: SENTFINE is fine-tuned on single sentences, DOCFINE is fine-tuned on multi-sentence sequences.
We present both automatic-metrics evaluation and manual analysis of the translation quality, focusing on the differences between the four systems.
Our goal has been to annotate the CzeSL corpus according to the non-native grammar in the mind of the author, not according to the standard grammar.
However, this brings many challenges.
First, we do not have enough data to get reliable insights into the grammar of each author.
Second, many phenomena are far more complicated than they are in native languages.
The state of the art of handling rich morphology in neural machine translation (NMT) is to break word forms into subword units, so that the overall vocabulary size of these units fits the practical limits given by the NMT model and GPU memory capacity.
In this paper, we compare two common but linguistically uninformed methods of subword construction (BPE and STE, the method implemented in Tensor2Tensor toolkit) and two linguistically-motivated methods: Morfessor and one novel method, based on a derivational dictionary.
Our experiments with German-to-Czech translation, both morphologically rich, document that so far, the non-motivated methods perform better.
Furthermore, we identify a critical difference between BPE and STE and show a simple pre-processing step for BPE that considerably increases translation quality as evaluated by automatic measures.
This work is a comparison of a quality and speed of  NMT systems Tensor2Tensor, Marian, Nematus, Neural Monkey and OpenNMT on two comparable translation tasks.

Machine learning models have been providing promising results in many fields including natural language processing.
These models are, nevertheless, prone to adversarial examples.
These are artificially constructed examples which evince two main features: they resemble the real training data but they deceive already trained model.
This paper investigates the effect of using adversarial examples during the training of recurrent neural networks whose text input is in the form of a sequence of word/character embeddings.
The effects are studied on a compilation of eight NLP datasets whose interface was unified for quick experimenting.
Based on the experiments and the dataset characteristics, we conclude that using the adversarial examples for NLP tasks that are modeled by recurrent neural networks provides a regularization effect and enables the training of models with greater number of parameters without overfitting.
In addition, we discuss which combinations of datasets and model settings might benefit from the adversarial training the most.
In this paper, we deal with reciprocity, its representation in a lexicon and its possible contribution to the description of verbs.
We present the first freely available dependency treebank of Sanskrit.
It is based on text from Panchatantra, an ancient Indian collection of fables.
The annotation scheme we chose is that of Universal Dependencies, a current de-facto standard for cross-linguistically comparable morphological and syntactic annotation.
In the present paper,
we discuss word segmentation issues, morphological inventory and certain interesting
syntactic constructions in the light of the Universal Dependencies guidelines.
We also present an initial parsing experiment.
This paper describes the CUNI submission to WAT 2018 for the English-Hindi translation task using a transfer
learning techniques which has proven effective under low resource conditions.
We have used the Transformer model and utilized an English-Czech parallel corpus as additional data source.
Our simple transfer learning approach first trains a “parent” model for a high-resource
language pair (English-Czech) and then continues the training on the low-resource (English-Hindi) pair by replacing
the training corpus.
This setup improves the performance compared with the baseline and in combination with back-translation of Hindi monolingual data, it allowed us to win the English-Hindi task.
The automatic scoring by BLEU did not correlate well with human judgments.
This article describes a two-step method for transcribing historic manuscripts.
In this method, the first step uses a page-based representation making it easy to transcribe the document page-by-page and line-by-line, while the second step converts this to the TEI/XML text-based format, in order to make sure the document becomes fully searchable.
We present a user interface between the Czech valency lexicon, PDT-Vallex [1], and KonText1 –
a web application for querying corpora available within the LINDAT/CLARIN project.
KonText
allows evaluation of simple and complex queries, displaying their results as concordance lines,
computing frequency distribution, calculating association measures for collocations and further
work with language data.
For every verb in a concordance line, our interface allows to display
information concerning its valency frame in a separate window if corresponding entries exist in
PDT-Vallex, as well as a list of possible valency frames for that particular verb.
Information
concerning verb frame comprises verb lemma, frame elements with semantic roles, vocabularystyle
description and examples from PDT-Vallex, Prague Dependency Treebank [2] and Prague
Czech-English Dependency Treebank [3].
The information is requested by REST-API from the
valency lexicon PDT-Vallex that contains over 11000 valency frames for more than 7000 verbs
which occurred in Prague Dependency Treebank, Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank or
Prague Dependency Treebank of Spoken Czech.
We use a fork of KonText application (developed
by the Institute of the Czech National Corpus) that has been further extended by the Institute
of Formal and Applied Linguistics to suit the needs of LINDAT/CLARIN project.
The plugin we
present provides a unique solution for Czech language that integrates valency information from the
Czech valency lexicon with the means of querying Prague Dependency Treebank.
Cross-tagset parsing is based on the substitution of one annotation layer for another while processing data within one language.
As often as not, either the native tagger or the dependency parser used in (pre-)annotation of the Gold treebank is not available.
The cross-tagset approach allows one to annotate new texts using freely available tools or tools optimized to user's needs.
We evaluate the robustness of Russian dependency parsing using different morphological and syntactic tagsets in input and output.
A qualitative analysis of errors shows that the cross-substitution of three morphological tagsets and two syntactic tagsets causes only a mild drop in performance.
Artificial dependency trees in the Universal Dependencies v2 style, focused on gapping (the 'orphan' relation in UD).
For motivation and description of the data, see Droganova et al., 2018 (LREC, Miyazaki, Japan).
In this work we focus on a particular linguistic phenomenon, ellipsis, and explore the latest parsers in order to learn about parsing accuracy and typical errors from the perspective of elliptical constructions.
For this purpose we collected and processed outputs of several state-of-the art parsers that took part in the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task.
We extended the official shared task evaluation software to obtain focused evaluation of elliptical constructions.
Since the studied structures are comparatively rare, and consequently there is not enough data for experimentation, we further describe the creation of a new resource, a semi-artificially constructed treebank of ellipsis.
We report on experiments with several approaches to automatically extending training data for dependency parsers, using large crawled web corpora.
One set of methods is general, draws upon self-training and tri-training and adds a novel algorithm of mimicking the structural complexity of the original treebank.
Methods from the other set are more focused on elliptical constructions.
We provide evaluation on 5 languages: Czech, English, Finnish, Russian and Slovak.
This document summarizes the discussion of the interest group on Optical Music Recognition (OMR) that took place in the 12th IAPR International Workshop on Graphics Recognition, and presents the main conclusions drawn during the session: OMR should revisit how it describes itself, and the OMR community should intensify its collaboration both internally and with other stakeholders.
We present LemmaTag, a featureless neural network architecture that jointly generates part-of-speech tags and lemmas for sentences by using bidirectional RNNs with character-level and word-level embeddings.
We demonstrate that both tasks benefit from sharing the encoding part of the network, predicting tag subcategories, and using the tagger output as an input to the lemmatizer.
We evaluate our model across several languages with complex morphology, which surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy in both part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization in Czech, German, and Arabic.
In this paper we report on the methods and findings of a multilingual corpus study focusing on the functions of and in English and its translations into Czech, French, Hungarian and Lithuanian, in a selection of TedTalks.
Analysis of functions of the discourse connective AND and its counterparts in English, Czech, Lithuanian, French and Hungarian according to the taxonomy with cross-domain functions (Crible, Degand, 2017).
Cross-linguistic comparison of the functions of the conjunction "and" and the possibilities of its translation, based on the parallel translations of subtitles in TED talks.
Pilot study about the underspecification of semantics of some conjunctions in different languages.
In linguistics, words are usually considered to be composed of morphemes: units that carry meaning and are not further subdivisible.
The task of this thesis is to create an automatic method for segmenting Czech words into morphemes, usable within the network of Czech derivational relations DeriNet.
We created two different methods.
The first one finds morpheme boundaries by differentiating words against their derivational parents, and transitively against their whole derivational family.
It explicitly models morphophonological alternations and finds the best boundaries using maximum likelihood estimation.
At worst, the results are slightly worse than the state of the art method Morfessor FlatCat, and they are significantly better in some settings.
The second method is a neural network made to jointly predict segmentation and derivational parents, trained using the output of the first method and the derivational pairs from DeriNet.
Our hypothesis that such joint training would increase the quality of the segmentation over training purely on the segmentation task seems to hold in some cases, but not in other.
The neural model performs worse than the first one, possibly due to being trained on data which already contains some errors, multiplying them.
This article investigates the compatibility of the current CLARIN license categorization scheme with the open science paradigm.
The first part presents the main concepts and theoretical framework required for the analysis, while the second part discusses the use of the CLARIN categorization system, divided into PUB (public), ACA (academic), and RES (restricted), and potential ways to change it.
This paper serves to explore various suggestions for change and to begin discussion of a reformed CLARIN license category scheme.
We explore the annotation of reflexives in Universal Dependencies (UD) 2.2 treebanks (Nivre et al., 2018), with a stronger focus on Slavic languages.
We have tried to find out if the current guidelines are transparent and clear enough for the annotators to follow them successfully.
We point out a number of inconsistencies in the current annotation across languages, and propose improvements—sometimes of the guidelines, but mostly of the annotation.
The goal of the paper is to contribute to more consistent and cross-linguistically parallel annotation of reflexives in the future releases of UD.
This work addresses the problem of matching musical audio directly to sheet music, without any higher-level abstract representation.
We propose a method that learns joint embedding spaces for short excerpts of audio and their respective counterparts in sheet music images, using multimodal convolutional neural networks.
Given the learned representations, we show how to utilize them for two sheet-music-related tasks: (1) piece/score identification from audio queries and (2) retrieving relevant performances given a score as a search query.
All retrieval models are trained and evaluated on a new, large scale multimodal audio–sheet music dataset which is made publicly available along with this article.
The dataset comprises 479 precisely annotated solo piano pieces by 53 composers, for a total of 1,129 pages of music and about 15 hours of aligned audio, which was synthesized from these scores.
Going beyond this synthetic training data, we carry out first retrieval experiments using scans of real sheet music of high complexity (e.g., nearly the complete solo piano works by Frederic Chopin) and commercial recordings by famous concert pianists.
Our results suggest that the proposed method, in combination with the large-scale dataset, yields retrieval models that successfully generalize to data way beyond the synthetic training data used for model building.
Current models for audio–sheet music retrieval
via multimodal embedding space learning use con-
volutional neural networks with a fixed-size win-
dow for the input audio.
Depending on the tempo
of a query performance, this window captures
more or less musical content, while notehead den-
sity in the score is largely tempo-independent.
In
this work we address this disparity with a soft
attention mechanism, which allows the model to
encode only those parts of an audio excerpt that
are most relevant with respect to efficient query
codes.
Empirical results on classical piano music
indicate that attention is beneficial for retrieval performance, and exhibits intuitively appealing
behavior.
In this chapter, we explore paraphrasability of Czech verbal MWEs (light verbs constructions and idioms) by single verbs in a semiautomatic experiment
using word embeddings.
Further, we propose a lexicographic representation and demonstrate one of its practical application in a machine translation
experiment.
A brief opening presentation for a panel on AI and the Humanities
In my talk, I presented the current translation quality achieved by neural machine translation and thoroughly discussed the expected benefits and risks for interpreters arising from the EU project ELITR.
We present results of automatic evaluation of discourse in machine translation (MT) outputs using the EVALD tool, showing that automatic evaluation of discourse in translated texts allows for distinguishing individual MT systems.
A corpus-based study of local coherence as established by anaphoric links between the elements in the thematic (Topic) and the rhematic (Focus) parts of sentences in different genres of texts in the Prague Dependency Treebank.
We put under scrutiny two dichotomies discussed in the information structure literature, namely the dichotomy of topic and focus based on the relation of aboutness, and the dichotomy between given and new information.
In particular, we examine whether the topic/focus dichotomy can be based on the distinction between given and new information, or whether the ‘aboutness’ relation is a more appropriate basis.
The CzEngClass synonym verb lexicon is a result of a project investigating semantic ‘equivalence’ of verb senses and their valency behavior in parallel Czech-English language resources, i.e., relating verb meanings with respect to contextually-based verb synonymy.

In the present article, we focus on valency and synonymy of verbs in a bilingual, Czech-English setting.
Our research of semantic equivalence of verbs is based on the FGD theory on the syntactic side (including valency), and gets main inspiration from FrameNet and VerbNet on the semantic side.
As the main source of evidence, we use the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0.
We consider this “bottom-up” approach a novel and appropriate approach to study verbal synonymy.
Synonymous Czech and English verbs are being grouped into cross-lingual synonym classes and captured in the new CzEngClass lexicon.
This lexicon contains not only mappings of valency arguments to semantic roles for each member of the synonym group, but also links them to individual verb entries in FrameNet, VerbNet, Vallex(es) and Czech and English WordNets, making CzEngClass also a richly interconnected lexicon.
We will look at one of the cornerstones of Universal Dependencies relation taxonomy, the core arguments and their difference from oblique dependents.
I will present Universal Dependencies, a worldwide community effort aimed at providing multilingual corpora, annotated at the morphological and syntactic levels following unified annotation guidelines.
I will discuss the concept of core arguments, one of the cornerstones of the UD framework.
In the second part of the talk I will focus on some interesting problems and challenges of applying Universal Dependencies to the Slavic languages.
I will discuss examples from 12 Slavic languages that are currently represented in UD and show that cross-linguistic consistency can still be improved.
Test data parsed by systems submitted to the CoNLL 2018 shared task in parsing Universal Dependencies.
Every year, the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) features a shared task, in which participants train and test their learning systems on the same data sets.
In 2018, one of two tasks was devoted to learning dependency parsers for a large number of languages, in a real-world setting without any gold-standard annotation on test input.
The aim of the contribution is to introduce a database of linguistic forms and their functions
built with the use of the multi-layer annotated corpora of Czech, the Prague Dependency
Treebanks.
The purpose of the Prague Database of Forms and Functions (ForFun) is to help the
linguists to study the form-function relation, which we assume to be one of the principal tasks
of both theoretical linguistics and natural language processing.
We demonstrate possibilities
of the exploitation of the ForFun database.
This article is largely based on a paper presented at the 16th International Workshop on
Treebanks and Linguistic Theories in Prague (Bejček et al., 2017).
The talk focused on multiple functions which the reflexives have in the Czech language and their representation in a lexicon.
Although treebanks annotated according to the guidelines of Universal Dependencies (UD) now exist for many languages, the goal of annotating the same phenomena in a crosslinguistically consistent fashion is not always met.
In this paper, we investigate one phenomenon where we believe such consistency is lacking, namely expletive elements.
Such elements occupy a position that is structurally associated with a core argument (or sometimes an oblique dependent), yet are non-referential and semantically void.
Many UD treebanks identify at least some elements as expletive, but the range of phenomena differs between treebanks, even for closely related languages, and sometimes even for different treebanks for the same language.
In this paper, we present criteria for identifying expletives that are applicable across languages and compatible with the goals of UD, give an overview of expletives as found in current UD treebanks, and
present recommendations for the annotation of expletives so that more consistent annotation can be achieved in future releases.
The paper presents the analysis of Czech verbal prefixes, which is the first step of a project that has the ultimate goal an automatic
morphemic analysis of Czech.
We studied prefixes that may occur in Czech verbs, especially their possible and impossible combinations.
We
describe a procedure of prefix recognition and derive several general rules for selection of a correct result.
The analysis of “double” prefixes enables to make conclusions about universality of the first prefix.
We also added linguistic comments to several types of prefixes.
This paper gives an overview of results of automatic analysis of word order in 23 dependency treebanks of the HamleDT project.
The analysis concentrates on basic characteristics of word order, the order of three main constituents, a predicate, a subject and an object.
A quantitative analysis is performed separately for main clauses and subordinated clauses.
The present paper deals with the changes of the category of grammatical aspect during derivation of verbs from verbs in Czech.
After summarizing the main issues of the long-standing debate over aspect in Czech, it is argued that formation of aspectual pairs can be seen as an integral part of derivation of Czech verbs.
In a language data resource capturing the derivational morphology of Czech, the category of aspect was employed as an important feature in modelling verb-to-verb derivation.
A set of criteria used for organization of verbs in the database is presented in the paper.
We present our ever ongoing work on cross-lingual syntactic parsing.
I present what I learned about the PhD studies at University of Genova, and suggest some changes to PhD studies at ÚFAL.
In this thesis, we focus on the problem of automatically syntactically analyzing a language for which there is no syntactically annotated training data.
We explore several methods for cross-lingual transfer of syntactic as well as morphological annotation, ultimately based on utilization of bilingual or multilingual sentence-aligned corpora and machine translation approaches.
We pay particular attention to automatic estimation of the appropriateness of a source language for the analysis of a given target language, devising a novel measure based on the similarity of part-of-speech sequences frequent in the languages.
The effectiveness of the presented methods has been confirmed by experiments conducted both by us as well as independently by other respectable researchers.
Wikipedia plain text data obtained from Wikipedia dumps with WikiExtractor in February 2018.
This is a system description paper for the CUNI x-ling submission to the CoNLL 2018 UD Shared Task.
We focused on parsing under-resourced languages, with no or little training data available.
We employed a wide range of approaches, including simple word-based treebank translation, combination of delexicalized parsers, and exploitation of available morphological dictionaries, with a dedicated setup tailored to each of the languages.
In the official evaluation, our submission was identified as the clear winner of the Low-resource languages category.
The subject of this monograph is to study properties of coreference using cross-lingual approaches.
We designed two cross-lingual methods: the bilingually informed coreference resolution and the coreference projection.
The results of our experiments suggest that with respect to coreference English is more informative for cyech than vice versa.
The subject of this thesis is to study properties of coreference using cross-lingual approaches.
The work is motivated by the research on coreference-related linguistic typology.
Another motivation is to explore whether differences in the ways how languages express coreference can be exploited to build better models for coreference resolution.
We design two cross-lingual methods: the bilingually informed coreference resolution and the coreference projection.
The results of our experiments with the methods carried out on Czech-English data suggest that with respect to coreference English is more informative for Czech than vice versa.
Furthermore, the bilingually informed resolution applied on parallel texts has managed to outperform the monolingual resolver on both languages.
In the experiments, we employ the monolingual coreference resolver and an improved method for alignment of coreferential expressions, both of which we also designed within the thesis.
We present a system for automatic evaluation of surface text coherence in Czech essays written by native and non-native speakers.
The features of the EVALD system cover spelling, vocabulary, morphology, syntax, discourse relations and coreference.
Newly we add features targeting topic–focus articulation.
Evaluating Optical Music Recognition (OMR) has
long been an acknowledged sore spot of the field.
This short
position paper attempts to bring some clarity to what are actually
open problems in OMR evaluation: a closer look reveals that the
main problem is finding an edit distance between some practical
representations of music scores.
While estimating these editing
costs in the transcription use-case of OMR is difficult, I argue
that the problems with modeling the subsequent editing workflow
can be de-coupled from general OMR system development using
an intrinsic evaluation approach, and sketch out how to do this.
Optical Music Recognition (OMR) promises to make large collections of sheet music searchable by their musical content.
It would open up novel ways of accessing the vast amount of written music that has never been recorded before.
For a long time, OMR was not living up to that promise, as its performance was simply not good enough, especially on handwritten music or under non-ideal image conditions.
However, OMR has recently seen a number of improvements, mainly due to the advances in machine learning.
In this work, we take an OMR system based on the traditional pipeline and an end-to-end system, which represent the current state of the art, and illustrate in proof-of-concept experiments their applicability in retrieval settings.
We also provide an example of a musicological study that can be replicated with OMR outputs at much lower costs.
Taken together, this indicates that in some settings, current OMR can be used as a general tool for enriching digital libraries.
Detecting music notation symbols is the most immediate unsolved  subproblem  in  Optical  Music  Recognition  for musical manuscripts.
We show that a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation combined with a trivial detector  already  establishes  a  high  baseline  for  this  task,  and we  propose  tricks  that  further  improve  detection  performance: training against convex hulls of symbol masks, and multichannel output models that enable feature sharing for semantically related symbols.
The latter is helpful especially for clefs, which have severe impacts on the overall OMR result.
We then integrate the networks into an OMR pipeline by applying a subsequent notation assembly stage, establishing a new baseline result for pitch inference in handwritten music at an f-score of 0.81.
Given the automatically inferred pitches we run retrieval experiments on handwritten scores, providing first empirical evidence that utilizing the powerful image processing models brings content-based search in large musical manuscript archives within reach.
The paper presents an application for lay, untrained users to generate high-quality, aligned phonetic transcription of speech.
The application has been in use for several years and has served to transcribe over 600 thousand word forms over two versions of a web interface.
We present measures for compensating the lack of expert training.
This paper presents a next-generation web application that enables users to contribute corrections to automatically acquired transcription of long speech recordings.
We describe differences from similar settings, compare our solution with others and reflect on the development from the now 6 years old work we build upon in the light of the progress made, lessons learned and the new technologies available in the browser.
We introduce a pilot version of CzeDLex, a Lexicon of Czech Discourse Connectives.
Currently, CzeDLex contains 205 lemmas of connectives coming from the annotation of the Prague Discourse Treebank 2.0 (PDiT).
At this stage, 19 lemmas have been fully manually processed, which covers more than two thirds of all discourse relations annotated in the PDiT.
UDPipe is a trainable pipeline which performs sentence segmentation, tokenization, POS tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing.
We present a prototype for UDPipe 2.0 and evaluate it in the CoNLL 2018 UD Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies, which employs three metrics for submission ranking.
Out of 26 participants, the prototype placed first in the MLAS ranking, third in the LAS ranking and third in the BLEX ranking.
In extrinsic parser evaluation EPE 2018, the system ranked first in the overall score.
The prototype utilizes an artificial neural network with a single joint model for POS tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing, and is trained only using the CoNLL-U training data and pretrained word embeddings, contrary to both systems surpassing the prototype in the LAS and BLEX ranking in the shared task.
The open-source code of the prototype is available at http://github.com/CoNLL-UD-2018/UDPipe-Future.
After the shared task, we slightly refined the model architecture, resulting in better performance both in the intrinsic evaluation (corresponding to first, second and second rank in MLAS, LAS and BLEX shared task metrics) and the extrinsic evaluation.
The improved models will be available shortly in UDPipe at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe.
Document summarization is a well-studied NLP task.
With the emergence of artificial neural network models, the summarization performance is increasing, as are the requirements on training data.
However, only a few datasets are available for Czech, none of them particularly large.
Additionally, summarization has been evaluated predominantly on English, with the commonly used ROUGE metric being English-specific.
In this paper, we try to address both issues.
We present SumeCzech, a Czech news-based summarization dataset.
It contains more than a million documents, each consisting of a headline, a several sentences long abstract and a full text.
The dataset can be downloaded using the provided scripts available at http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-2615.
We evaluate several summarization baselines on the dataset, including a strong abstractive approach based on Transformer neural network architecture.
The evaluation is performed using a language-agnostic variant of ROUGE.
The report focuses on existing morphological resources containing derivational wordformation relations.
For each resource, the report describes history, licence, format, data structure and some other basic statistics to compare.
Therefore, it means the first step to review and harmonize these resources in a similar way as it has already been done with resources of syntactic trees.
We present a morphological analyzer for Shipibo-Konibo, a low-resourced native language spoken in the Amazonian region of Peru.
We resort to the robustness of finite-state systems in order to model the complex morpho-syntax of the language.
Evaluation over raw corpora shows promising coverage of grammatical phenomena, limited only by the scarce lexicon.
We make this tool freely available so as to aid the production of annotated corpora and impulse further research in native languages of Peru.
This tool is the first morphological analyzer ever for this language.
The analyzer is a FST that produces all possible segmentations and tagging sequences in a word-by-word fashion.
Sentence-aligned parallel bilingual corpora are the main and sometimes the only required resource for training Statistical and Neural Machine Translation systems (SMT, NMT).
We propose an end-to-end deep neural architecture for language independent sentence alignment.
In addition to one-to-one alignment, our aligner can perform cross- and many-to-many alignment as well.
We also present a case study which shows how simple linguistic analysis can improve the performance of a pure neural network significantly.
We used three language pairs from Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) and an English-Persian corpus (Pilevar et al., 2011) to generate an alignment dataset.
Using this dataset, we tested our system individually and in an SMT system.
In both settings, we obtained significantly better results compared to an open source baseline.
Wikipedia provides an invaluable source of parallel multilingual data, which are in high demand
for various sorts of linguistic inquiry, including both theoretical and practical studies.
We intro-
duce a novel end-to-end neural model for large-scale parallel data harvesting from Wikipedia.
Our model is language-independent, robust, and highly scalable.
We use our system for collect-
ing parallel German-English, French-English and Persian-English sentences.
Human evaluations
at the end show the strong performance of this model in collecting high-quality parallel data.
We
also propose a statistical framework which extends the results of our human evaluation to other
language pairs.
Our model also obtained a state-of-the-art result on the German-English dataset
of BUCC 2017 shared task on parallel sentence extraction from comparable corpora.
In this paper, we propose a new linguistically-based approach to answering non-factoid open-domain questions from unstructured data.
First, we elaborate on an architecture for textual encoding based on which we introduce a deep end-to-end neural model.
This architecture benefits from a bilateral attention mechanism which helps the model to focus on a question and the answer sentence at the same time for phrasal answer extraction.
Second, we feed the output of a constituency parser into the model directly and integrate linguistic constituents into the network to help it concentrate on chunks of an answer rather than on its single words for generating more natural output.
By optimizing this architecture, we managed to obtain near-to-human-performance results and competitive to a state-of-the-art system on SQuAD and MS-MARCO datasets respectively.
The talk is devoted to the development of dictionaries and lexicons of discourse-relational devices across languages, from the very first ones from 1990ies to the recent ones, including the CzeDLex, the Lexicon of Czech Discourse Connectives.
Neural Monkey is an open-source toolkit for sequence-to-sequence learning.
The focus of this paper is to present the current state of the toolkit to the intended audience, which includes students and researchers, both active in the deep learning community and newcomers.
For each of these target groups, we describe the most relevant features of the toolkit, including the simple configuration scheme, methods of model inspection that promote useful intuitions, or a modular design for easy prototyping.
We summarize relevant contributions to the research community which were made using this toolkit and discuss the characteristics of our toolkit with respect to other existing systems.
We conclude with a set of proposals for future development.
This is the Czech version of the Multi30k dataset that is used for WMT competitions in Multimodal Machine Translation.
The dataset is based on the Flickr30k dataset with more 30,000 images accompanied by English captions.
For the WTM16 and WMT17 German and French translation were added to these captions.
For the WTM18 competition, we added also the translation into the Czech language.
We present our submission to the WMT18 Multimodal Translation Task.
The main feature of our submission is applying a self-attentive network instead of a recurrent neural network.
We evaluate two methods of incorporating the visual features in the model: first, we include the image representation as another input to the network; second, we train the model to predict the visual features and use it as an auxiliary objective.
For our submission, we acquired both textual and multimodal additional data.
Both of the proposed methods yield significant improvements over recurrent networks and self-attentive textual baselines.
In this work, we focus on three different NLP tasks: image captioning, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.
We reimplement successful approaches of other authors and adapt them to the Czech language.
We provide end-to-end architectures that achieve state-of-the-art or nearly state-of-the-art results on all of the tasks within a single sequence learning toolkit.
The trained models are available both for download as well as in an online demo.
Autoregressive decoding is the only part of sequence-to-sequence models that prevents them from massive parallelization at inference time.
Non-autoregressive models enable the decoder to generate all output symbols independently in parallel.
We present a novel non-autoregressive architecture based on connectionist temporal classification and evaluate it on the task of neural machine translation.
Unlike other non-autoregressive methods which operate in several steps, our model can be trained end-to-end.
We conduct experiments on the WMT English-Romanian and English-German datasets.
Our models achieve a significant speedup over the autoregressive models, keeping the  translation quality comparable to other non-autoregressive models.
In multi-source sequence-to-sequence tasks, the attention mechanism can be modeled in several ways.
This topic has been thoroughly studied on recurrent architectures.
In this paper, we extend the previous work to the encoder-decoder attention in the Transformer architecture.
We propose four different input combination strategies for the encoder-decoder
attention: serial, parallel, flat, and hierarchical.
We evaluate our methods on tasks of multimodal translation and translation with
multiple source languages.
The experiments show that the models are able to use multiple sources and improve over single source baselines.
We describe our NMT system submitted to
the WMT2018 shared task in news translation.
Our system is based on the Transformer model
(Vaswani et al., 2017).
We use an improved
technique of backtranslation, where we iterate
the process of translating monolingual data in
one direction and training an NMT model for
the opposite direction using synthetic parallel
data.
We apply a simple but effective filtering
of the synthetic data.
We pre-process the input
sentences using coreference resolution in order
to disambiguate the gender of pro-dropped
personal pronouns.
Finally, we apply two simple
post-processing substitutions on the translated output.
Our system is significantly (p < 0.05) better than all other English-Czech and Czech-English systems in WMT2018.
In this paper, we present a set of improvements introduced to MUMULS, a tagger for the automatic detection of verbal multiword expressions.
Our tagger participated in the PARSEME shared task and it was the only one based on neural networks.
We show that character-level embeddings can improve the performance, mainly by reducing the out-of-vocabulary rate.
Furthermore, replacing the softmax layer in the decoder by a conditional random field classifier brings additional improvements.
Finally, we compare different context-aware feature representations of input tokens using various encoder architectures.
The experiments on Czech show that the combination of character-level embeddings using a convolutional network, self-attentive encoding layer over the word representations and an output conditional random field classifier yields the best empirical results.
The aim of the paper is to examine the interplay of text coreference and sentence
information structure and its role in text coherence.
In  the  paper, we  introduce  two  software applications  for  automatic  evaluation  of coherence in Czech texts called EVALD – Evaluator  of  Discourse.
The  first  one – EVALD 1.0 – evaluates texts  written by native  speakers  of  Czech on a  five - step scale  commonly  used  at  Czech  schools (grade 1 is the best, grade 5 is the worst).
The second application is EVALD
1.0 for Foreigners  assessing  texts  by  non-native speakers  of  Czech  using  six - step  scale (A1–C2) according to CEFR.
Both applications are available online at https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/evald-foreign/.
This package contains data sets for development and testing of machine translation of medical search short queries between Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Polish, Spanish and Swedish.
The queries come from general public and medical experts.
This paper summarizes theoretical findings on the lexicographic description of Czech complex predicates with light verbs.
We examine the effects of particular orderings of sentence pairs on the on-line training of neural machine translation (NMT).
We focus on two types of such orderings: (1) ensuring that each minibatch contains sentences similar in some aspect and (2) gradual inclusion of some sentence types as the training progresses
(so called “curriculum learning”).
In our English-to-Czech experiments, the internal homogeneity of minibatches has no effect on the training but some of our “curricula” achieve a small improvement over the baseline.
In the talk, I describe basics of text mining.
First, I describe various applications of text mining.
Then, I focus on basic methods frequently used in text mining applications.
Last, we will use online tools to pre-process text and create a word cloud.
In this paper, we survey different state-of-the-art visual processing methods and utilize them in hyperlinking.
Visual information, calculated using Features Signatures, SIMILE descriptors and convolutional neural networks (CNN), is utilized as similarity between video frames and used to find similar faces, objects and setting.
Visual concepts in frames are also automatically recognized and textual output of the recognition is combined with search based on subtitles and transcripts.
All presented experiments were performed in the Search and Hyperlinking 2014 MediaEval task and Video Hyperlinking 2015 TRECVid task.
The goal of this paper is to survey annotation of ellipsis in Universal Dependencies (UD) 2.0 treebanks.
In the long term, knowing the types and frequencies of elliptical constructions is important for parsing experiments focused on ellipsis, which was also our original motivation.
However, the current state of annotation is still far from perfect, and thus the main outcome of the present study is a description of errors and inconsistencies; we hope that it will help improve the future releases.
We discuss a process of exploiting a large corpus
manually annotated with discourse relations – the Prague Discourse Treebank 2.0 – to create a lexicon of Czech discourse connectives (CzeDLex).
We present theoretical aspects of the project and a technical solution based on the (XML-based) Prague Markup Language that allows for an efficient incorporation of the lexicon into the family of Prague treebanks.
This paper presents two  studies on software tools developed for lexical derivationa databases such as  DeriNet; the tools under study serve for querying and visualizing derivational trees contained in the database.
This paper describes how to turn a Latin dependency treebank into queryable information so that it can be browsed online using a tree query engine and its web interface.
The annotation layers of the treebank are first introduced, then the query system architecture is detailed, and finally the way the treebank is converted into a relational database architecture is described.
The subject of our analysis are cohesive devices important for discourse analysis in three Slavonic languages vs. English based on translated texts, particularly coreferential expressions such as finite and infinite constructs e.g.
relative clauses, participial, possessive and correlative constructions with a demonstrative pronoun.
A special point of our analysis is comparison of pro-drop qualities of three Slavonic languages in comparison with English.
Musical symbol detection on the page is an out- standing Optical Music Recognition (OMR) subproblem.
We propose using a fully convolutional segmentation network to produce high-quality pixel-wise symbol probability masks.
Experiments on notehead detection show a very promising detection f-score of 0.98 with elementary detection methods.
We present a new freely available dictionary of paraphrases of Czech complex predicates with light verbs, ParaDi.
Candidates for single predicative paraphrases of selected complex predicates have been extracted automatically from large mono-lingual data using word2vec.
They have been manually verified and further refined.
We demonstrate one of many possible applications of ParaDi in an experiment with improving machine translation quality.
In this paper we present our participation as the team of the Charles University at Task3 Patient-Centred Information Retrieval in CLEF eHealth Evaluation lab 2017
A talk at an in-house workshop of DGT "Smart Select" on neural MT toolkits and on the difficulties of NMT training.
The talk has highlighted some aspects of the frantic development in the area of neural machine translation and suggested some ways of keeping the research directions stable in the quickly changing environments.
A talk describing neural MT in general and our first experiments with neural MT for IBM.
A summary of the development of neural MT at Charles University.
This paper describes the neural and
phrase-based machine translation systems
submitted by CUNI to English-Czech
News Translation Task of WMT17.
We
experiment with synthetic data for training
and try several system combination techniques,
both neural and phrase-based.
Our
primary submission CU-CHIMERA ends
up being phrase-based backbone which incorporates
neural and deep-syntactic candidate
translations.
This paper presents the results of the
WMT17 shared tasks, which included
three machine translation (MT) tasks
(news, biomedical, and multimodal), two
evaluation tasks (metrics and run-time estimation
of MT quality), an automatic
post-editing task, a neural MT training
task, and a bandit learning task.
This paper presents the results of the WMT17 Neural MT Training Task.
The objective of this task is to explore the methods of training a fixed neural architecture, aiming primarily at the best translation quality and, as a secondary goal, shorter training time.
Task participants were provided with a complete neural machine translation system, fixed training data and the configuration of the network.
The translation was performed in the English-to-Czech direction and the task was divided into two subtasks of different configurations - one scaled to fit on a 4GB and another on an 8GB GPU card.
We received 3 submissions for the 4GB variant and 1 submission for the 8GB variant; we provided also our run for each of the sizes and two baselines.
We translated the test set with the trained models and evaluated the outputs using several automatic metrics.
We also report results of the human evaluation of the submitted systems.
We presented the current state of development and experiments with neural MT at Charles University within the project QT21.
UFAL Medical Corpus is a collection of parallel corpora assembled for the purposes of the EU projects KConnect, Khresmoi and HimL aiming at more reliable machine translation of medical texts.
MorphInd is a robust fínite state morphology tool for Indonesian, which handles
both morphological analysis and lemmatization for a given surface word form so that it is

Phraseological components of valency dictionaries for two West Slavic languages are presented, namely, of the PDT-Vallex dictionary for Czech and of the Walenty dictionary for Polish.
Both dictionaries are corpus-based, albeit in different ways.
Both are machine readable and employable by syntactic parsers and generators.
The paper compares the expressive power of the phraseological subformalisms of these dictionaries, discusses their limitations and makes recommendations for their possible extensions, which can be possibly applied also to other valency dictionaries with rich phraseological components.

Achievements in Medical-domain Machine Translation within the KConnect project
We summarize the involvement of our CEMI team in the Native Language Identification shared task, NLI Shared Task~2017, which deals with both textual and speech input data.
We submitted the results achieved by using three different system architectures; each of them combines multiple supervised learning models trained on various feature sets.
As expected, better results are achieved with the systems that use both the textual data and the spoken responses.
Combining the input data of two different modalities led to a rather dramatic improvement in classification performance.
Our best performing method is based on a set of feed-forward neural networks whose hidden-layer outputs are combined together using a softmax layer.
We achieved a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.9257 on the evaluation (unseen) test set and our team placed first in the main task together with other three teams.
We introduce a general and efficient technical solution for building a lexicon of discourse connectives (presented on the case of CzeDLex, a new Lexicon of Czech Discourse Connectives), based on the Prague Markup Language framework and extraction of the raw core version of the lexicon from a large treebank.
CzeDLex is a new electronic lexicon of Czech discourse connectives.
Its data format and structure are based on a study of similar existing resources, and adjusted to comply with the Czech syntactic tradition and specifics and with the Prague approach to the annotation of semantic discourse relations in text.
We first put the lexicon in context of related resources and discuss theoretical aspects of building the lexicon.
Second, we introduce the chosen technical solution based on the Prague Markup Language.
Third, we describe the process of getting data for the lexicon by exploiting a large corpus manually annotated with discourse relations.
We investigate how core arguments are coded in case-marking Indo-European languages.
Core arguments are a central concept in Universal Dependencies, yet it is sometimes difficult to match against terminologies traditionally used for individual languages.
We review the methodology described in Andrews (2007), and include brief definitions of some basic terms.
Statistics from 26 UD treebanks show that not all treebank providers define the core-oblique boundary the same way.
Therefore we propose some refinement and particularization of the guidelines that would improve cross-treebank consistency on the one hand, and be more sensitive to the traditional grammar on the other.
I will summarize the parsing shared task we organized this spring.
11 years after the first CoNLL shared task in dependency parsing, the present one has arguably been one of the largest CoNLL shared tasks ever, both in size and diversity of test data (81 treebanks, 49 languages) and in number of participants (over 50 teams, 32 submissions).
There were several novel aspects: end-to-end parsing from raw text, low-resource and surprise languages, unified annotation across languages, blind evaluation on a remote server.
The results set the new state of the art for dependency parsing of most languages, including Czech.

We describe a conversion of the syntactically annotated part of the Slovak National Corpus into the annotation scheme known as Universal Dependencies.
Only a small subset of the data has been converted so far; yet it is the first Slovak treebank that is publicly available for research.
We list a number of research projects in which the dataset has been used so far, including the first parsing results.
We describe the family of corpus file formats called CoNLL, with special focus on its newest member, the CoNLL-U format.
We present Universal Dependencies (UD), a community-driven project aimed at defining a cross-linguistically applicable annotation scheme for morphology and syntax of natural languages.
The key idea of UD is that comparable constructions should be analyzed and annotated in comparable ways; structural representations of parallel sentences in two languages should be as parallel as possible.
The community behind UD is very diverse and so are the use cases that UD tries to support: models for natural language processing (especially tagging and parsing); linguistic research and corpus queries; language-typological studies.
Besides defining annotation guidelines, UD also collects actual corpora, converts them to the unified annotation and makes them freely available for research.
Being driven by data availability, UD is obviously biased towards resource-rich Eurasian languages; however, there are also samples from minority languages, and several ancient languages, too.
The first part of the talk will describe the main principles of UD and present the project in general.
In the second part, we will look more closely at the treebanks of classical languages, and discuss some challenges of harmonizing traditional terminology both synchronically and diachronically.
We will also demonstrate query tools that can be used to study the data.
This package contains the system outputs from the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task in Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies.
The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) features a shared task, in which participants train and test their learning systems on the same data sets.
In 2017, one of two tasks was devoted to learning dependency parsers for a large number of languages, in a real-world setting without any gold-standard annotation on input.
All test sets followed a unified annotation scheme, namely that of Universal Dependencies.
In this paper, we define the task and evaluation methodology, describe data preparation, report and analyze the main results, and provide a brief categorization of the different approaches of the participating systems.
The talk evaluated several properties of Czech clitics: mainly constraints on their placement within the sentence and haplology of reflexive clitics.
We present a pilot study on parsing non-native texts written by learners of Czech.
We performed experiments that have shown that at least  high-level syntactic functions, like subject, predicate, and object, can be assigned based on a parser trained on standard native language.
ForFun is an interface for various linguistic research, particularly in describing syntactic functions and their formal realizations in Czech sentences.
ForFun draws on the complex linguistic annotation of Prague Dependency Treebanks (PDTs) and arranges morphological and syntactical annotation into new tool which gives a possibility to search quickly and in a user-friendly way all forms (almost 1,500 items) used in PDTs for particular function and vice versa to look up all functions (66 items) expressed by the particular forms.
In many languages, some words can be written in several ways.
We call them variants.
Values of all their morphological categories are identical, which leads to an identical morphological tag.
Together with the identical lemma, we have two or more wordforms with the same morphological description.
This ambiguity may cause problems in various NLP applications.
There are two types of variants – those affecting the whole paradigm (global variants) and those affecting only wordforms sharing some combinations of morphological values (inflectional variants).
In the paper, we propose means
how to tag all wordforms, including their variants, unambiguously.
We call this requirement ”Golden rule of morphology”.
The paper deals mainly with Czech, but the ideas can be applied to other languages as well.
We explore human judgments on how well individual patterns of 29 target verbs from the Pattern Dictionary of English Verbs describe their random KWICs.
We focus on cases where more than one pattern is judged as highly appropriate for a given KWIC and seek to estimate the effect of event participants (arguments) being denotatively similar in two patterns, considering all pair combinations in a given lemma.
We compare this effect to the effect of several contextual features of the KWICs,  the effect of paired PDEV implicatures implying each other, and the effect of belonging to a given lemma.
We show that the lemma effect is still stronger than any feature going across lemmas we have examined so far, so that each verb appears to be a little universe in its own right.
Very fast implementation of the filter bank for splitting the input complex signal into N equidistant frequency channels.
The aim of our contribution is to introduce a database of linguistic forms and their functions built with the use of the multi-layer annotated corpora of Czech, the Prague Dependency Treebanks.
The purpose of the Prague Database of Forms and Functions (ForFun) is to help the linguists to study the form-function relation, which we assume to be one of the principal tasks of both theoretical linguistics and natural language processing.
We will also demonstrate possibilities of the exploitation of the ForFun database.
In the paper, the boundary between borrowing and word formation (particularly, derivation) is studied on the example of the suffixes -ismus and -ita, which occur in nouns in Czech.
Formal (both inflectional and derivational) and semantic features of nouns with the suffixes -ismus and -ita are introduced.
The paper deals with verbal paradigms with respect to inflectional and derivational morphology of Czech, and its aim is to contribute to the discussion on the absence of clear boundaries between inflection and derivation.
The aspect is an inflectional category of Czech verbs which is formally expressed by derivation.
The present paper describes a semi-automatic method of adding derivational links to the lexical database DeriNet by identifying verbs which are derived by suffixation and constitute aspectual pairs.
It briefly introduces the notion of aspect in Czech and discusses the account of aspect in the Czech linguistic literature and in existing data resources.
As its main focus, it presents an approach to identifying aspectual pairs based on extraction of such pairs from the VALLEX valency dictionary, identification of suffix substitution rules and subsequent manual annotation, which resulted in the addition of almost 6,000 derivational links into the DeriNet database.
A simple way of browsing CoNLL and CoNLLU format files in your terminal.

Presenting Treex CR - the coreference resolution system for English and Czech.
The paper describes the system for coreference resolution in German and Russian, trained exclusively on coreference relations projected through a parallel corpus from English.
The resolver operates on the level of deep syntax and makes use of multiple specialized models.
It achieves 32 and 22 points in terms of CoNLL score for Russian and German, respectively.
Analysis of the evaluation results show that the resolver for Russian is able to preserve 66\% of the English resolver's quality in terms of CoNLL score.
The system was submitted to the Closed track of the CORBON 2017 Shared task.
Automatic segmentation, tokenization and morphological and syntactic annotations of raw texts in 45 languages, generated by UDPipe (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe), together with word embeddings of dimension 100 computed from lowercased texts by word2vec (https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).
Translating into morphologically rich languages is  difficult.
Although  the  coverage of lemmas may be reasonable,  many morphological variants cannot be learned from the training data.
We present a statistical translation system that is able to produce these inflected word forms.
Different from most previous work, we do not separate morphological prediction from lexical choice into two consecutive steps.
Our approach  is  novel  in  that  it  is  integrated  in decoding  and  takes  advantage  of  context information from both the source language and the target language sides.
It has been shown that increasing model depth improves the quality of neural machine translation.
However, different architectural variants to increase model depth have been proposed, and so far, there has been no thorough comparative study.
In this work, we describe and evaluate several existing approaches to introduce depth in neural machine translation.
Additionally, we explore novel architectural variants, including deep transition RNNs, and we vary how attention is used in the deep decoder.
We introduce a novel "BiDeep" RNN architecture that combines deep transition RNNs and stacked RNNs.
Our evaluation is carried out on the English to German WMT news translation dataset, using a single-GPU machine for both training and inference.
We find that several of our proposed architectures improve upon existing approaches in terms of speed and translation quality.
We obtain best improvements with a BiDeep RNN of combined depth 8, obtaining an average improvement of 1.5 BLEU over a strong shallow baseline.
We release our code for ease of adoption.
Most compositions created throughout history exist today only in written form, usually residing in archive collections; specifically in the Czech Republic, there are many more than 10 000 such manuscripts.
To preserve and disseminate this portion of cultural heritage, it is advantageous to digitize it; further usability would be brought by also digitizing the contents of these documents.
However, transcribing music with notation editors such as Sibelius or MuseScore is too time-consuming.
Optical Music Recognition (OMR), the equivalent of OCR for music notation, can be a key tool for opening the contents of musical archives to large-scale musicological research, better curation (e.g., duplicate search), and for making the way from an archival score to performance easier.
We present MUSCIMarker, an open-source workbench
for developing Optical Music Recognition (OMR) systems from image preprocessing to MIDI export.
It is built
around the notation graph data model of the MUSCIMA++
dataset for full-pipeline OMR.
The system is transparent
and interactive, enabling the user to visualize, validate
and edit results of individual OMR stages.
It is platform-independent, written purely in Python, and can work offline.
We demonstrate its value with a prototype OMR system for musical manuscripts that implements the recognition pipeline, up to playing the recognition outputs through
MIDI.
The audience will interact with the program and can
test an integrated OMR system prototype.
Noteheads are the interface between the written score and music.
Each notehead on the page signifies one note to be played, and detecting noteheads is thus an unavoidable step for Optical Music Recognition.
In printed notation, noteheads are clearly distinct objects; however, the variety of music notation handwriting makes noteheads harder to identify, and while handwritten music notation symbol classification is a well-studied task, symbol detection has usually been limited to heuristics and rule-based systems instead of machine learning methods better suited to deal with the uncertainties in handwriting.
We present ongoing work on a simple notehead detector using convolutional neural networks for pixel classification and bounding box regression that achieves a detection f-score of 0.97 on binary score images in the MUSCIMA++ dataset, does not require staff removal, and is applicable to a variety of handwriting styles and levels of musical complexity.
In this paper, we describe an improvement
on the task of giving instructions to robots
in  a  simulated  block  world  using  unrestricted natural language commands

In the paper, we present our efforts to annotate evaluative language in the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0.
The project is a follow-up of the series of annotations of small plaintext corpora.
It uses automatic identification of potentially evaluative nodes through mapping a Czech subjectivity lexicon to syntactically annotated data.
The annotations unveiled several advantages and disadvantages of the chosen framework.
We describe the process of creating NUDAR, a Universal Dependency treebank for Arabic.
We present the conversion from the Penn Arabic Treebank to the Universal Dependency syntactic representation through an intermediate dependency representation.
We discuss the challenges faced in the conversion of the trees, the decisions we made to solve them, and the validation of our conversion.
We also present initial parsing results on NUDAR.
The paper deals with secondary language signals that can express the semantics of implicit discourse relations.
These include, for example, evaluative expressions in focus, usually followed by an argument with the meaning of explication or specification.
The paper focuses on the description and delimitation of discourse connectives, i.e.
linguistic expressions significantly contributing to text coherence and generally
helping the reader to better understand semantic relations within a text.
The paper
discusses the historical origin of discourse connectives viewed from the perspective
of present-day linguistics.
Its aim is to define present-day discourse connectives
according to their historical origin through which we see what is happening in discourse in contemporary language.
The paper analyzes the historical origin of the most frequent connectives in Czech, English and German (which could be useful for more accurate translations of connectives in these languages) and point out that they underwent a similar process to gain a status of present-day discourse connectives.
The paper argues that this historical origin or process of rising discourse connectives might be language universal.
Finally, the paper demonstrates how these observations may be helpful for annotations of discourse in large corpora.
We present an update to UDPipe 1.0, a trainable pipeline which performs sentence segmentation, tokenization, POS tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing.
We provide models for all 50 languages of UD 2.0, and furthermore, the pipeline can be trained easily using data in CoNLL-U format.
For the purpose of the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies, the updated UDPipe 1.1 was used as one of the baseline systems, finishing as the 13th system of 33 participants.
A further improved UDPipe 1.2 participated in the shared task, placing as the 8th best system, while achieving low running times and moderately sized models.
The tool is available under open-source Mozilla Public Licence (MPL) and provides bindings for C++, Python (through ufal.udpipe PyPI package), Perl (through UFAL::UDPipe CPAN package), Java and C#.
We present our contribution to The First Shared Task on Extrinsic Parser Evaluation (EPE 2017).
Our participant system, the UDPipe, is an open-source pipeline performing tokenization, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing.
It is trained in a language agnostic manner for 50 languages of the UD version 2.
With a relatively limited amount of training data (200k tokens of English UD) and without any English specific tuning, the system achieves overall score 56.05, placing as the 7th participant system.
Describing clarin-dspace architecture and the compliance to RDA-DFT/FAIR/OAIS.
We propose Constrained Deep Neural Network (CDNN) a deep neural model for answer sentence selection in the context of
Question Answering (QA) systems.
To
produce the best predictions, CDNN combines neural reasoning with a kind of
symbolic constraint.
It integrates pattern
matching technique into sentence vector
learning.
When trained using enough samples, CDNN outperforms the other best
models for sentence selection.
We show how the use of other sources of
training can enhance the performance of
CDNN.
In a well-studied dataset for answer sentence selection, our model improves the state-of-the-art significantly
In this short paper, we report a progressing work on a hybrid deep neural system for answering open-domain factoid and non-factoid questions.
This system supplements knowledge graph based Question Answering with free-texts searching techniques to address the sparsity issues in knowledge graphs.
We justify the efficiency of the proposed system based on the results of a pilot experiment.
We also describe the settings of an on-going project in the context of this system.
We report on a progressing work for compiling Quora question answer dataset.
Quora dataset is composed of the questions which are posed in
Quora question answering site.
It is the only dataset which provides answers in
sentence level and word level at the same time.
Moreover, the questions in the
dataset are authentic which is much more realistic for question answering systems.
We test the performance of a state-of-the-art question answering system on
the dataset and compare it with human performance to establish an upper bound
for the dataset
The presentation offers an overview and comparison of present-day electronic lexicons of discourse connectives in different languages, with a special regard on the recently developed lexicon of Czech connectives – CzeDLex.
Neural machine translation (NMT) has become a widely-adopted approach to machine translation in the past few years.
In our tutorial, we will start with the introduction to the basics of the deep learning methods used in NMT, such as recurrent neural networks and their advanced variants (GRU or LSTM networks), or the algorithms for their optimization.
We introduce the NMT-specific models, such as the attention mechanism, and describe the methods used for decoding the target sentences, including model ensembling and beam search.
We will go through the recent advancements in the field and discuss their impact on the state-of-the-art methods used in this year's WMT competition (http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/).
In this paper, we describe our submissions to the WMT17 Multimodal
Translation Task.
For Task 1 (multimodal translation), our best scoring
system is a purely textual neural translation  of the source image caption to
the target language.
The main feature of the system is the use of additional
data that was acquired by selecting similar sentences from parallel corpora
and by data synthesis with back-translation.
For Task 2 (cross-lingual image
captioning), our best submitted system generates an English caption which is
then translated by the best system used in Task 1.
We also present negative
results, which are based on ideas that we believe have potential of making
improvements, but did not prove to be useful in our particular setup.
The aim of this lab is to familiarize the users with the Neural Monkey toolkit for sequence learning experiments.
Modeling attention in neural multi-source sequence-to-sequence learning remains a relatively unexplored area, despite its usefulness in tasks that incorporate multiple source languages or modalities.
We propose two novel approaches to combine the outputs of attention mechanisms over each source sequence, flat and hierarchical.
We compare the proposed methods with existing techniques and present results of systematic evaluation of those methods on the WMT16 Multimodal Translation and
Automatic Post-editing tasks.
We show the proposed methods achieve competitive results on both tasks.
This paper demonstrates one of the possible ways on how to represent and query corpora with multiword expression (MWE) annotation.
We exploit the multilingual corpus of 18 languages created under the PARSEME project with verbal multiword expression (VMWE) annotation.
VMWEs include categories such as idioms, light verb constructions, verb-particle constructions, inherently reflexive verbs, and others.
The corpus was mainly used for the purposes of training predictive models, yet not much linguistic research was conducted based on this data.
We discuss how to allow linguists to query for MWEs in a simple user interface using the Corpus Query Language (CQL) within the NoSke corpus management and concordance system.
Despite its limited abilities to represent challenging cases such as discontinuous, coordinated or embedded VMWEs, CQL can be sufficient to make basic analysis of the MWE-annotated data in corpus-based studies.
In this paper we describe the MUMULS system that participated to the 2017 shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs).
The MUMULS system was implemented using a supervised approach based on recurrent neural networks using the open source library TensorFlow.
The model was trained on a data set containing annotated VMWEs as well as morphological and syntactic information.
The MUMULS system performed the identification of VMWEs in 15 languages, it was one of few systems that could categorize VMWEs type in nearly all languages.
This paper presents a novel task using real user data obtained in human-machine conversation.
The task concerns with denotation extraction from answer hints collected interactively in a dialogue.
The task is motivated by the need for large amounts of training data for question answering dialogue system development, where the data is often expensive and hard to collect.
Being able to collect denotation interactively and directly from users, one could improve, for example, natural understanding components online and ease the collection of the training data.
This paper also presents introductory results of evaluation of several denotation extraction models including attention-based neural network approaches.
This paper presents a hybrid dialog state tracker enhanced by trainable Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) for slot-filling dialog systems.
Our architecture is inspired by previously proposed neural-network-based belief-tracking systems.
In addition, we extended some parts of our modular architecture with differentiable rules to allow end-to-end training.
We hypothesize that these rules allow our tracker to generalize better than pure machine-learning based systems.
For evaluation, we used the Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) 2 dataset - a popular belief tracking testbed with dialogs from restaurant information system.
To our knowledge, our hybrid tracker sets a new state-of-the-art result in three out of four categories within the DSTC2.
Udapi is an open-source framework providing
an application programming interface
(API) for processing Universal Dependencies
data.
Udapi is available in
Python, Perl and Java.
It is suitable
both for full-fledged applications and fast
prototyping: visualization of dependency
trees, format conversions, querying, editing
and transformations, validity tests, dependency
parsing, evaluation etc.
Following upon the last year's CUNI system for automatic post-editing of machine translation output,
we focus on exploiting the potential of sequence-to-sequence neural models for this task.
In this system description paper, we compare several encoder-decoder architectures on a smaller-scale models and present the system we submitted to WMT 2017 Automatic Post-Editing shared task based on this preliminary comparison.
We also show how simple inclusion of synthetic data can improve the overall performance as measured by an automatic evaluation metric.
Lastly, we list few example outputs generated by our post-editing system.
We introduce possibilities of automatic evaluation of surface text coherence (cohesion) in texts written by learners of Czech during certified exams for non-native speakers.
On
the basis of a corpus analysis, we focus on finding and describing relevant distinctive
features for automatic detection of A1–C1 levels (established by CEFR – the Common
European Framework of Reference for Languages) in terms of surface text coherence.
The CEFR levels are evaluated by human assessors and we try to reach this assessment
automatically by using several discourse features like frequency and diversity of discourse
connectives, density of discourse relations etc.
We present experiments with various
features using two machine learning algorithms.
Our results of automatic evaluation
of CEFR coherence/cohesion marks (compared to human assessment) achieved 73.2%
success rate for the detection of A1–C1 levels and 74.9% for the detection of A2–B2
levels.
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is sometimes considered an almost solved problem in NLP.
Standard supervised approaches often reach accuracy above 95% if sufficiently large hand-labeled training data are available (typically several hundred thousand tokens or more).
However, we still believe that it makes sense to study semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches.
This paper describes a hybrid Machine Translation (MT) system built for translating from English
to German in the domain of technical documentation.
The system is based on three different
MT engines (phrase-based SMT, RBMT, neural) that are joined by a selection mechanism
that uses deep linguistic features within a machine learning process.
It also presents a detailed
source-driven manual error analysis we have performed using a dedicated “test suite” that contains
selected examples of relevant phenomena.
While automatic scores show huge differences
between the engines, the overall average number or errors they (do not) make is very similar for
all systems.
However, the detailed error breakdown shows that the systems behave very differently
concerning the various phenomena.
Recognizing textual entailment is typically considered as a binary decision task – whether a text T entails a hypothesis H. Thus, in case of a negative answer, it is not possible to express that H is “almost entailed” by T. Partial textual entailment provides one possible approach to this issue.
This paper presents an attempt to use word2vec model for recognizing partial (faceted) textual entailment.
The proposed approach does not rely on language dependent NLP tools and other linguistic resources, therefore it can be easily implemented in different language environments where word2vec models are available.
Current computational linguistics witnesses a massive increase of interest in sentiment analysis, as it is a powerful means of public opinion mining.
However, is it even possible to distinguish between good and evil using statistical methods?
How would you treat irony, idioms, innovative vulgarisms and other inherent elements of natural language?
Are emotions language-independent?
I will share my thoughts and opinions towards these issues, describing the state-of-the art approaches employed in sentiment analysis.

In this paper, we compare delexicalized transfer and minimally supervised parsing techniques on 32 different languages from Universal Dependencies treebank collection.
The minimal supervision is in adding handcrafted universal grammatical rules for POS tags.
The rules are incorporated into the unsupervised dependency parser in forms of external prior probabilities.
We also experiment with learning this probabilities from other treebanks.
The average attachment score of our parser is slightly lower then the delexicalized transfer parser, however, it performs better for languages from less resourced language families (non-Indo-European) and is therefore suitable for those, for which the treebanks often do not exist.
In  this  paper,  we  present  our  new  experimental system of merging dependency
representations  of  two  parallel  sentences
into  one  dependency  tree.
All  the  inner  nodes  in  dependency  tree  represent source-target  pairs  of  words,   the  extra words are in form of leaf nodes.
We use Universal Dependencies annotation style, in  which  the  function  words,  whose  usage  often  differs  between  languages,  are annotated  as  leaves.
The  parallel  treebank  is  parsed  in minimally  supervised way.
Unaligned  words  are  there  automatically  pushed  to  leaves.
We  present a  simple  translation  system  trained  on such   merged   trees   and   evaluate   it   in WMT 2016 English-to-Czech and Czech-to-English  translation  task.
Even though the model is so far very simple and no language  model  and  word-reordering  model were  used,  the  Czech-to-English  variant reached similar BLEU score as another established tree-based system.
In the last 12 years, there has been a big progress in the field of unsupervised dependency parsing.
Different approaches however sometimes differ in motivation and definition of the problem.
Some of them allow using resources that are forbidden by others, since they are treated
as a kind of supervision.
The goal of this paper is to define all the variants of unsupervised dependency parsing problem and show their motivation, progress, and the best results.
We also discuss the usefulness of the unsupervised
parsing generally, both for the formal linguistics and for the applications.
We present a work in progress aimed at extracting translation pairs of source and target dependency treelets to be used in a dependency-based machine translation system.
We introduce a novel unsupervised method for parallel tree segmentation based on Gibbs sampling.
Using the data from a Czech-English parallel treebank, we show that the procedure converges to a dictionary containing reasonably sized treelets; in some cases, the segmentation seems to have interesting linguistic interpretations.
We present a novel dataset for natural language generation (NLG) in spoken dialogue systems which includes preceding context (user utterance) along with each system response to be generated, i.e., each pair of source meaning representation and target natural language paraphrase.
We expect this to allow an NLG system to adapt (entrain) to the user’s way of speaking, thus creating more natural and potentially more successful responses.
The dataset has been collected using crowdsourcing, with several stages to obtain natural user utterances and corresponding relevant, natural, and contextually bound system responses.
The dataset is available for download under the Creative Commons 4.0 BY-SA license.
We present a novel natural language generation system for spoken dialogue systems capable of entraining (adapting) to users' way of speaking, providing contextually appropriate responses.
The generator is based on recurrent neural networks and the sequence-to-sequence approach.
It is fully trainable from data which include preceding context along with responses to be generated.
We show that the context-aware generator yields significant improvements over the baseline in both automatic metrics and a human pairwise preference test.
Diatheses represent relations between different surface syntactic structures of verbs.
They are conditioned by changes in morphological meaning of a verb and they are associated with specific changes in its valency structure.
In this contribution, I discussed changes in the surface syntactic expressions of Czech complex predicates.
The contribution discusses the distribution of ACTors in light verb constructions in Czech.
In this contribution, we propose a lexicographic representation of Czech complex predicates.
Special attention is devoted to the selection of collocations of function verbs and predicative nouns and to the annotation of their syntactic structure.
In this paper, we focus on Czech complex predicates formed by a light verb and a predicative noun expressed as the direct object.
Although Czech – as an inflectional language encoding syntactic relations via morphological cases – provides an excellent opportunity to study the distribution of valency complements in the syntactic structure with complex predicates, this distribution has not been described so far.
On the basis of a manual analysis of the richly annotated data from the Prague Dependency Treebank, we thus formulate principles governing this distribution.
In an automatic experiment, we verify these principles on well-formed syntactic structures from the Prague Dependency Treebank and the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank with very satisfactory results: the distribution of 97% of valency complements in the surface structure is governed by the proposed principles.
These results corroborate that the surface structure formation of complex predicates is a regular process.
Increased interest in natural language ‘understanding’ has brought into the focus of much current work a variety of techniques often described as ‘semantic parsing’.
We present a completely featureless, language agnostic named entity recognition system.
Following recent advances in artificial neural network research, the recognizer employs parametric rectified linear units (PReLU), word embeddings and character-level embeddings based on
gated linear units (GRU).
Without any feature engineering, only with surface forms, lemmas and tags as input, the network achieves excellent results in Czech NER and surpasses the current state of the art of previously published Czech NER systems, which use manually designed rule-based orthographic classification features.
Furthermore, the neural network achieves robust results even when only surface forms are available as input.
In addition, the proposed neural network can use the manually designed rule-based orthographic classification features and in such combination, it exceeds the current state of the art by a wide margin.
In this paper, we describe SHAMUS, our system for an easy search and navigation in multimedia archives.
The system consists of three components.
The Search component provides a text-based search in a multimedia collection, the Anchoring component determines the most important segments of videos, and segments topically related to the anchoring ones are retrieved by the Hyperlinking component.
In the paper, we describe each component of the system as well as the online demo interface which currently works with a collection of TED talks.
This paper presents the work on Machine Translation (MT) that has been conducted within the KConnect project, funded under the H2020 programme and focused on development and commercialization of cloud-based services for multilingual Semantic Annotation, Semantic Search and Machine Translation of electronic health records and medical publications.
We first present the main goal and role of MT in the project and then briefly describe the main methods and components developed in the project, including training data acquisition, methods of domain adaptation, deployment of MT as cloud-based web-service, and the training toolkit allowing easy adaptation of the MT service to new languages.
Cílem prezentace je kvantitativní analýza syntaktických závislostí v češtině.
Pro každé slovo syntakticky anotovaného korpusu (Bejček et al.
2013) odvozujeme závislostní rámec , který je tvořen analytickými funkcemi přiřazenými každému bezprostředně závislému slovu.
The aim of this poster is to present an easy-to-use web application specifically developed for annotating Russian texts with morphological and syntactic information.
This report presents the Universal Dependencies (UD) annotated corpus for Russian and a conversion process which was developed to transform the SynTagRus dependency treebank of Russion into a UD-style annotated corpus.
The paper investigates the similarities in the application of attribute grammars to two seemingly different research areas, namely the area of formal description of workflows and the area of checking the syntactic correctness
of natural languages.
It uses existing models
and formalisms and tries to find a common ground
which would enable to exploit mutually the experience gained in both individual fields.
It shows how a slight adaptation of a grammar formalism used for grammar checking of languages with a high degree of word-order freedom may lead to a tool useful for a workflow verification.
ConFarm is a web service dedicated to extraction of surface representations of verb and noun constructions from dependency annotated corpora of Russian texts.
Currently, the extraction of constructions with a specific lemma from SynTagRus and Russian National Corpus is available.
The system provides flexible interface that allows users to fine-tune the output.
Extracted constructions are grouped by their contents to allow for compact representation, and the groups are visualized as a graph in order to help navigating the extraction results.
ConFarm differs from similar existing tools for Russian language in that it offers full constructions, as opposed to extracting separate dependents of search word or working with collocations, and allows users to discover unexpected constructions as opposed to searching for examples of a user-defined construction.
This work addresses the issue of building a free NLP pipeline for processing Russian texts from plain text to morphologically and syntactically annotated structures in CONLL format.
The pipeline is written in python3.
Segmentation is provided by our own module.
Mystem with numerous postprocessing fixes is used for lemmatization and morphology tagging.
Finally, syntactical annotation is obtained with MaltParser utilizing our own model trained on SynTagRus, which was converted into CONLL format for this purpose, with its morphological tagset being converted into Mystem/Russian National Corpus tagset
This contribution dealt with passive and deagentive diatheses of Czech verbs with genitive complementation.
According to their changes in valency structure, these verbs are classified into three groups: (1) verbs that behave in the same way as verbs with accusative complementation, (2) verbs that preserve genitive complementations and (3) verbs complementations of which can be expressed in the nominative, or in the genitive.
In the talk, I summariye common and different features in the annotation approaches to Czech (PDT-like) and German (applied in GECCo).
This paper discusses models for dialogue state tracking using recurrent neural networks (RNN).
We present experiments on the standard dialogue state tracking (DST) dataset, DSTC2.
On the one hand, RNN models became the state of the art models in DST, on the other hand, most state-of-the-art models are only turn-based and require dataset-specific preprocessing (e.g.
DSTC2-specific) in order to achieve such results.
We implemented two architectures which can be used in incremental settings and require almost no preprocessing.
We compare their performance to the benchmarks on DSTC2 and discuss their properties.
With only trivial preprocessing, the performance of our models is close to the state-of- the-art results.
This paper presents a novel dataset for training end-to-end task oriented conversational agents.
The dataset contains conversations between an operator – a task expert, and a client who seeks information about the task.
Along with the conversation transcriptions, we record database API calls performed by the operator, which capture a distilled meaning of the user query.
We expect that the easy-to-get supervision of database calls will allow us to train end-to-end dialogue agents with significantly less training data.
The dataset is collected using crowdsourcing and the conversations cover the well-known restaurant domain.
Quality of the data is enforced by mutual control among contributors.
The dataset is available for download under the Creative Commons 4.0 BY-SA license.
We propose two contributions to discriminative rule selection in hierarchical machine translation.
First, we test  previous  approaches on two French-English translation tasks in domains for which only limited resources are  available  and  show  that  they  fail  to improve  translation  quality.
To improve on  such  tasks,  we  propose  a  rule  selection  model  that  is  (i)  global  with  rich label-dependent  features  (ii)  trained  with all available negative samples.
Our global model yields significant improvements, up to 1  BLEU  point,  over  previously  proposed rule selection models.
A summary of ten years of automatic MT evaluation, highlighting past successful metrics, current evaluation challenges and topics that need to be tackled in the future.
Phraseological components of valency dictionaries for two West Slavic languages are presented, namely, of the PDT-Vallex dictionary for Czech and of the Walenty dictionary for Polish.
Both dictionaries are corpus-based, albeit in different ways.
Both are machine readable and employable by syntactic parsers and generators.
The paper compares the expressive power of the phraseological subformalisms of these dictionaries, discusses  their limitations and makes recommendations for their possible extensions, which can be possibly applied also to other valency dictionaries with rich phraseological components.
The arguments against the Argument-Adjunct distinction presented by A. Przepiórkowski in this volume are analyzed.
The criteria iterability, specificity and dialogue test conditions are analyzed here and their usefulness for the framework of FGD is demonstrated.
We will present tree-shaped structures that are used in Natural Languages Processing for representing sentence syntactical structure, and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such representations.
Apart to discourse relations expressed primarily by discourse connectives (and partly also being implicit), there are other relations in the discourse that contribute to the text connectedness and have to be taken into consideration.
This concerns first of all the information  structure of the sentence and the relations of coreference.
All these three aspects are included in the annotation scheme of the Prague Dependency Treebank.
This paper introduces a new bilingual Czech-English verbal valency lexicon (called CzEng-Vallex) representing a relatively large empirical database.
It includes 20,835 aligned valency frame pairs (i.e., verb senses which are translations of each other) and their aligned arguments.
This new lexicon uses data from the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank and also takes advantage of the existing valency lexicons for both languages: the PDT-Vallex for Czech and the EngVallex for English.
The CzEngVallex is available for viewing in LINDAT/CLARIN repository.
We present a design for a new electronic lexicon of Czech discourse connectives.
The data format and the annotation scheme are based on a study of similar existing resources, and we discuss arguments for choosing the data structure and
selecting features of the lexicon entries.
A special attention is paid to a consistent encoding
of both primary and secondary connectives.
The data itself comes from exploiting the Prague Dependency Treebank, a large treebank manually annotated with discourse relations.
The PML-Tree Query is a general, powerful and user-friendly system for querying richly linguistically annotated treebanks.
The paper shows how the PML-Tree Query can be used for searching for discourse relations in the Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 mapped onto the syntactic annotation of the Penn Treebank.
Universal Dependencies (UD) is a project that seeks to find a cross-linguistically applicable morphological and syntactic annotation scheme, and to publish data conforming to that scheme in a wide range of languages.
We will briefly motivate and introduce the project, its history and underlying principles.
Then we will present the new proposal of version 2 UD guidelines.
Finally, time permitting, we will describe several interesting problems related to the application of UD to Slavic languages.
This article is an attempt to propose application of a subset of the Universal Dependencies (UD) standard to the group of Slavic languages.
The subset in question comprises morphosyntactic features of various verb forms.
We systematically document the inventory of features observable with Slavic verbs, giving numerous examples from 10 languages.
We demonstrate that terminology in literature may differ, yet the substance remains the same.
Our goal is practical.
We definitely do not intend to overturn the many decades of research in Slavic comparative linguistics.
Instead, we want to put the properties of Slavic verbs in the context of UD, and to propose a unified (Slavic-wide) application of UD features and values to them.
We believe that our proposal is a compromise that could be accepted by corpus linguists working on all Slavic languages.
Various unsupervised and semi-supervised
methods have been proposed to tag and parse
an unseen language.
We explore delexicalized
parsing, proposed by (Zeman and Resnik,
2008), and delexicalized tagging, proposed
by (Yu et al., 2016).
For both approaches
we provide a detailed evaluation on Universal
Dependencies data (Nivre et al., 2016), a de-facto standard for multi-lingual morphosyntactic processing (while the previous work used other datasets).
Our results confirm that in separation, each of the two delexicalized techniques has some limited potential when no annotation of the target language is available.
However, if used in combination, their errors multiply beyond acceptable limits.
We demonstrate that even the tiniest bit of expert annotation in the target language may contain significant potential and should be used if available.
In this contribution, the family of valency lexicons whose theoretical background represents the Functional Generative Description is introduced, VALLEX, PDT-Vallex, EngVallex and CzEngVallex.
We focus on a problem of homonymy and polysemy in morphological dictionaries on the example of the Czech morphological dictionary MorfFlex CZ.
It is not necessary to distinguish meanings in morphological dictionaries unless the distinction has consequencies in word formation or syntax.
The contribution proposes several  important rules and principles for achieving consistency.
This poster gives an overview of the results of automatic analysis of word order in 23 dependency treebanks.
These treebanks have been collected in the frame of in the HamleDT project, whose main goal is to provide universal annotation for dependency corpora.
Overview of my project concerning MWEs at Second PARSEME Training School in La Rochelle.
We analyze inner structure of complex address data
given in text, categorize it, annotate
it and evaluate the annotation.
We show that verbal MWEs similar to those specified in PARSEME Shared Task have already been annotated in Prague Dependency Treebank and all their individual categories can be extracted and used within the Shared Task.
The paper  deals  with  two  main  issues,  each  approaching  the  relation between  derivational  (sub-)paradigms (as discussed by Štekauer 2014) and inflectional paradigms  from  a  different perspective.
First,  a  recent  enrichment  of  the  DeriNet network  is  described  which  focused  on  words  the  derivation  of  which  is  accompanied by consonant and/or vowel alternations.
Second,  inflectional  features  have  been  used  as  an  important  input  for  the  semi-automatic task of semantic labelling of derivational relations in the DeriNet network.
This paper presents the resources so far created in the Universal Dependencies (UD) project, which attempts to address a lack of cross-linguistically adequate dependency representations for natural language processing.
This is a document-aligned parallel corpus of English and Czech abstracts of scientific papers published by authors from the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University in Prague, as reported in the institute's system Biblio.
For each publication, the authors are obliged to provide both the original abstract in Czech or English, and its translation into English or Czech, respectively.
No filtering was performed, except for removing entries missing the Czech or English abstract, and replacing newline and tabulator characters by spaces.
We present our work on semi-supervised parsing of natural language sentences, focusing on multi-source crosslingual transfer of delexicalized dependency parsers.
We present KLcpos3, an empirical language similarity measure, designed and tuned for source parser weighting in multi-source delexicalized parser transfer.
And finally, we introduce a novel resource combination method, based on interpolation of trained parser models.
We describe our submission to the IT-domain translation task of WMT 2016.
We perform domain adaptation with dictionary data on already trained MT systems with no further retraining.
We apply our approach to two conceptually different systems developed within the QTLeap project: TectoMT and Moses, as well as Chimera, their combination.
In all settings, our method improves the translation quality.
Moreover, the basic variant of our approach is applicable to any MT system, including a black-box one.
Moses is a well-known representative of the phrase-based statistical machine translation systems family, which are known to be extremely poor in explicit linguistic knowledge, operating on flat language representations, consisting only of tokens and phrases.
Treex, on the other hand, is a highly linguistically motivated NLP toolkit, operating on several layers of language representation, rich in linguistic annotations.
Its main application is TectoMT, a hybrid machine translation system with deep syntax transfer.
We review a large number of machine translation systems that have been built over the past years by combining Moses and Treex/TectoMT in various ways.
The paper presents an attempt to automate all data creation processes of a rule-based shallow-transfer machine translation system.
The presented methods were tested on four fully functional translation systems covering language pairs: Slovenian paired with Serbian, Czech, English and Estonian language.
An extensive range of evaluation tests was performed to assess the applicability of the methods.
Medical and healthcare study programmes are quite complicated in terms of branched structure and heterogeneous content.
In logical sequence a lot of requirements and demands placed on students appear there.
This paper focuses on an innovative way how to discover and understand complex curricula using modern information and communication technologies.
We introduce an algorithm for curriculum metadata automatic processing -- automatic keyword extraction based on unsupervised approaches, and we demonstrate a real application during a process of innovation and optimization of medical education.
The outputs of our pilot analysis represent systematic description of medical curriculum by three different approaches (centrality measures) used for relevant keywords extraction.
Further evaluation by senior curriculum designers and guarantors is required to obtain an objective benchmark.

PDiT 2.0 is a new version of the Prague Discourse Treebank.
It contains a complex annotation of discourse phenomena enriched by the annotation of secondary connectives.
We describe experiments in Machine Translation using word sense disambiguation (WSD) information.
This work focuses on WSD in verbs, based on two different approaches -- verbal patterns based on corpus pattern analysis and verbal word senses from valency frames.
We evaluate several options of using verb senses in the source-language sentences as an additional factor for the Moses statistical machine translation system.
Our results show a statistically significant translation quality improvement in terms of the BLEU metric for the valency frames approach, but in manual evaluation, both WSD methods bring improvements.
The paper showcases the MT-ComparEval tool for qualitative evaluation of machine translation (MT).
MT-ComparEval is an opensource
tool that has been designed in order to help MT developers by providing a graphical user interface that allows the comparison
and evaluation of different MT engines/experiments and settings.
This work addresses the need to aid Machine Translation (MT) development cycles with a complete workflow of MT evaluation methods.
Our aim is to assess, compare and improve MT system variants.
We hereby report on novel tools and practices that support various measures, developed in order to support a principled and informed approach of MT development
This  paper  describes  our  system  for  aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA).
We participate in Subtask 1 (sentence-level ABSA), focusing specifically on aspect category detection.
We  train  a  binary  classifier  for  each category.
This  year’s  addition  of  multiple languages  makes  language-independent  approaches  attractive.
We  propose  to  utilize neural  networks  which  should  be  capable  of
discovering linguistic patterns in the data automatically,   thereby  reducing  the  need  for language-specific tools and feature engineering.
Discriminative translation models utilizing source context have been shown to help statistical machine translation performance.
We propose a novel extension of this work using target context information.
Surprisingly, we show that this model can be efficiently integrated directly in the decoding process.
Our approach scales to large training data sizes and results in consistent improvements in translation quality on four language pairs.
We also provide an analysis comparing the strengths of the baseline source-context model with our extended source-context and target-context model and we show that our extension allows us to better capture morphological coherence.
Our work is freely available as part of Moses.
Paraphrasing of reference translations has been shown to improve the correlation with human judgements in automatic evaluation of
machine translation (MT) outputs.
In this work, we present a new dataset for evaluating English-Czech translation based on automatic
paraphrases.
We compare this dataset with an existing set of manually created paraphrases and find that even automatic paraphrases can
improve MT evaluation.
We have also propose and evaluate several criteria for selecting suitable reference translations from a larger set.
This paper describes the phrase-based systems
jointly submitted by CUNI and LMU
to English-Czech and English-Romanian
News translation tasks of WMT16.
In contrast
to previous years, we strictly limited
our training data to the constraint datasets,
to allow for a reliable comparison with
other research systems.
We experiment
with using several additional models in our
system, including a feature-rich discriminative
model of phrasal translation.
UDPipe is an trainable pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing of CoNLL-U files.
UDPipe is language-agnostic and can be trained given only annotated data in CoNLL-U format.

One of the goals of LINDAT/CLARIN Centre for Language Research Infrastructure is to provide technical background to institutions or researchers who wants to share their tools and data used for research in linguistics or related research fields.
The digital repository is built on a highly customised DSpace platform.
CLARIN Service Provider Federation is not the only inter-federation but it is the first one to systematically address the issue when Identity Providers do not release mandatory attributes to a service.
For instance, if a data set is licensed under a restrictive license the user must be uniquely identifiable over time.
However, if the Identity Provider does not release such information, the service cannot let the user download the data.
We introduce a highly scalable approach for open-domain question answering with no dependence on any logical form to surface form mapping data set or any linguistic analytic tool such as POS tagger or named entity recognizer.
We define our approach under the Constrained Conditional Models framework which lets us scale to a full knowledge graph with no limitation on the size.
On a standard benchmark, we obtained competitive results to state-of-the-art in open-domain question answering task.

In this paper, we deal with extraction of textual information from scene images.
So far, the task of Scene Text Recognition (STR) has only been focusing on recognition of isolated words and, for simplicity, it omits words which are too short.
Such an approach is not suitable for further processing of the extracted text.
We define a new task which aims at extracting coherent blocks of text from scene images with regards to their future use in natural language processing tasks, mainly machine translation.
For this task, we enriched the annotation of existing STR benchmarks in English and Czech and propose a string-based evaluation measure that highly correlates with human judgment.
Neural sequence to sequence learning recently became a very promising paradigm in machine translation, achieving competitive results with statistical phrase-based systems.
In this system description paper, we attempt to utilize several recently published methods used for neural sequential learning in order to build systems for WMT 2016 shared tasks of Automatic Post-Editing and Multimodal Machine Translation.
In the poster, I demonstrated how multiword expressions can be represented and quired in a corpus query system KonText
The UD relation mwe is not used consistently in the current release of Universal Dependencies.
While part of the issue may be caused by true linguistic differences, we demonstrate on closely related languages that it is not always the case; even literally equivalent expressions do not always receive the same analysis.
In this paper, we focus on the incorporation of a valency lexicon into TectoMT system for Czech-Russian language pair.
We demonstrate valency errors in MT output and describe how the introduction of a lexicon influenced the translation results.
Though there was no impact on BLEU score, the manual inspection of concrete cases showed some improvement.
This work presents parallel corpora automatically annotated with several NLP tools, including lemma and part-of-speech tagging,
named-entity recognition and classification, named-entity disambiguation, word-sense disambiguation, and coreference.
This paper presents a dataset collected from natural dialogs which enables to test the ability of dialog systems to learn new facts from user utterances throughout the dialog.
This interactive learning will help with one of the most prevailing problems of open domain dialog system, which is the sparsity of facts a dialog system can reason about.
The proposed dataset, consisting of 1900 collected dialogs, allows simulation of an interactive gaining of denotations and questions explanations from users which can be used for the interactive learning.

We present MLFix, an automatic statistical post-editing system, which is a spiritual successor to the rulebased
system, Depfix.
The aim of this
thesis was to investigate the possible approaches to automatic identification of the most common
morphological errors produced by the state-of-the-art machine translation systems and to train sufficient
statistical models built on the acquired knowledge.
We performed both automatic and manual evaluation
of the system and compared the results with Depfix.
The system was mainly developed on the English-toCzech
machine translation output, however, the aim was to generalize the post-editing process so it can
be applied to other language pairs.
We modified the original pipeline to post-edit English-German
machine translation output and performed additional evaluation of this modification.
The aim of the present contribution is to document, on the material of the Prague Dependency Treebank, that the assumed freedom of Czech word order is not really a freedom but that it is guided by certain principles, different from the grammatically given principles determining the word order in some other European languages such as English, German or French.
On newly annotated data, an implementation of the algorithm for the division of the sentence into topic and focus based on contextual boundness of nodes at the tectogrammatical layer is tested.
Corpus-based research demonstrates an existence of a mutual interaction of bridging anaphoric relations in the text and sentence information
structure.
In the report, we introduce the concept of topic–focus articulation on the basis of Functional Generative Description.
Firstly, we present the crucial terms connected with topic–focus articulation – mainly contextual boundness and communicative dynamism and we describe operational criteria how to detect topic and focus: the so-called question test and test by negation.
In the next part, we present the annotation principles for annotation of topic–focus articulation in the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank.
We present subjectivity lexicon of positive and negative words for Indonesian language created by automatically translating English lexicons.
We compare the lexicons in the task of predicting sentence polarity.
We present a novel syntax-based natural language generation system that is trainable from unaligned pairs of input meaning representations and output sentences.
It is divided into sentence planning, which incrementally builds deep-syntactic dependency trees, and surface realization.
Sentence planner is based on A* search with a perceptron ranker that uses novel differing subtree updates and a simple future promise estimation; surface realization uses a rule-based pipeline from the Treex NLP toolkit.
Our first results show that training from unaligned data is feasible, the outputs of our generator are mostly fluent and relevant.
Complex predicates with light verbs have
proven to be very challenging for syntactic
theories, particularly due to the tricky distribution of valency complementations of
light verbs and predicative nouns in their syntactic structure.
We propose a theoretically adequate
and economical representation of complex
predicates  with  Czech  light  verbs  based
on a division of their description between
the lexicon and the grammar.
We demonstrate that a close interplay between these
two components makes the analysis of the
deep  and  surface  syntactic  structures  of
complex predicates reliable and efficient.
Task 18 at SemEval 2015 defines Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP) as the problem of recovering sentence-internal predicate-argument relationships for all content words, i.e.
the semantic structure constituting the relational core of sentence meaning.
In this task description, we position the problem in comparison to other language analysis sub-tasks, introduce and compare the semantic dependency target representations used, and summarize the task setup, participating systems, and main results.

Presented were existing syntactically analyzed treebanks, such as the Penn Treebank and the Prague family of dependency Treebanks, and their relation to Multiword Expressions.
The aim of the present contribution is to put under scrutiny the ways in which the so-called deletions of elements in the surface shape of the sentence are treated in syntactically annotated corpora and to attempt at a categorization of deletions within a multilevel annotation scheme.
In this contribution the treatment of selected types of deletions in Czech are presented.
The pro-dropped constructions,absent subjects in controlled infinitive constructions, selected types of Czech "small clauses" and comparison constructions are analyzed and exemplified.

This report presents a guideline for building a valency lexicon (CzEngVallex) of Czech and English verbs  based on the parallel dependency corpus (PCEDT) and two existing valency lexicons: PDT-Vallex a EngVallex.
We address the application of UD to Slavic languages.
We devote the most space to peculiarities of pronouns, determiners, numerals and quantifiers.
Other language features that are discussed include modal verbs, ellipsis, nominal predicates, and reflexive pronouns.
Most of our examples are from Czech but the language features demonstrated are usually portable to other Slavic languages.
We include examples from the other languages where appropriate.
HamleDT (HArmonized Multi-LanguagE Dependency Treebank) is a compilation of existing dependency treebanks (or dependency conversions of other treebanks), transformed so that they all conform to the same annotation style.
This version uses Universal Dependencies as the common annotation style.

This is a set of MSTperl parser configuration files and scripts for delexicalized parser transfer.
They were used in the work reported in arXiv:1506.04897 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04897), as well as several related papers.
The MSTperl parser is available at http://hdl.handle.net/11234/1-1480
MSTperl is a Perl reimplementation of the MST parser of Ryan McDonald, with several additional advanced functions, such as support for parallel features.
We compare two annotation styles, Prague dependencies and Universal
Stanford Dependencies, in their adequacy for parsing.
We specifically focus on comparing the adposition attachment style, used in these two
formalisms, applied in multi-source cross-lingual delexicalized dependency
parser transfer performed by parse tree combination.
We show that in our setting, converting the adposition annotation to Stanford style in the
Prague style training treebanks leads to promising results.
We find that best results can be obtained by parsing the target sentences
with parsers trained on treebanks using both of the adposition annotation
styles in parallel,
and combining all the resulting parse trees together
after having converted them to the Stanford adposition style (+0.39% UAS over Prague
style baseline).
The score improvements are considerably more significant when using a smaller set of diverse source
treebanks (up to +2.24% UAS over the baseline).
We present our work on semi-supervised
parsing of natural language sentences, focusing
on multi-source crosslingual transfer
of delexicalized dependency parsers.
We first evaluate the influence of treebank
annotation styles on parsing performance,
focusing on adposition attachment
style.
Then, we present KLcpos3, an empirical
language similarity measure, designed
and tuned for source parser weighting
in multi-source delexicalized parser
transfer.
And finally, we introduce a novel
resource combination method, based on
interpolation of trained parser models.
We present an implementation of domain adaptation by translation model interpolation in the
TectoMT translation system with deep transfer.
We evaluate the method on six language pairs
with a 1000-sentence in-domain parallel corpus, and obtain improvements of up to 3 BLEU
points.
The interpolation weights are set uniformly, without employing any tuning.
We present KLcpos3, a language similarity measure based on Kullback-Leibler
divergence of coarse part-of-speech tag trigram distributions in tagged
corpora.
It has been designed for multilingual delexicalized parsing, both for
source treebank selection in single-source parser transfer, and for source
treebank weighting in multi-source transfer.
In the selection task, KLcpos3
identifies the best source treebank in 8 out of 18 cases.
In the weighting
task, it brings +4.5% UAS absolute, compared to unweighted parse tree
combination.
We introduce interpolation of trained MSTParser models as a resource combination method for multi-source delexicalized parser transfer.
We present both an unweighted method, as well as a variant in which each source model is weighted by the similarity of the source language to the target language.
Evaluation on the HamleDT treebank collection shows that theweightedmodelinterpolationperforms comparably to weighted parse tree combination method, while being computationally much less demanding.

MT-ComparEval is a tool for Machine Translation developers, which allows to compare and evaluate different MT systems (and their versions).
MT-ComparEval includes several automatic MT evaluation metrics.
We present recent developments of Korektor, a
statistical spell checking system.
In addition to lexicon, Korektor uses language models to find real-word errors, detectable only in context.
The models and error probabilities, learned from error corpora, are also used to suggest the most likely corrections.
Korektor was originally
trained on a small error corpus and used language models extracted from an in-house corpus WebColl.
We show two recent improvements:
• We built new language models from freely avail-
able (shuffled) versions of the Czech National Corpus and show that these perform consistently better on texts produced both by native speakers and non-native learners of Czech.
• We trained new error models on a manually annotated learner corpus and show that they perform better than the standard error model (in error detection) not only for the learners’ texts, but also for our standard eval-
uation data of native Czech.
For error correction, the standard error model outperformed non-native models in 2 out of 3 test datasets.
We discuss reasons for this not-quite-intuitive improvement.
Based on these findings and on an analysis of errors in both native and learners’ Czech, we propose directions
for further improvements of Korektor.
The aim of this work is (i) to compare two frameworks for the analysis and annotation
of discourse-structuring devices (DSDs) and further discourse phenomena in GECCo X PDiT and (ii) identify commonalities and/or differences between the two frameworks

dence scores, abstracting scarcely represented values, including
transcriptions in the training data, and model averaging

Obituary article evaluating the scientific contribution of J.J.Robinson, an American computational linguist, one of the founders of the field.
We introduce the CLARIN Concept Registry, a new on-line registry of semantic concepts that can be used in (and referenced from) CLARIN projects.
This new registry replaces (for CLARIN purposes) ISOcat.
We discuss various issues that made ISOcat less useful, and propose solutions to those issues in CCR.
In this monograph we present the results of our research on the interplay of intra-sentential relations such as deep syntactic relations and information structure of the sentence and the inter-sentential relations such as discourse relations and coreferential and other associative links.
The aim of the poster is to contribute to the general discussion on discourse connectives,
especially on their definition and principles we may hold as boundaries surrounding this class of
expressions.
We present a pilot study in web-based annotation of words with senses coming
from several knowledge bases and sense inventories.
The study is the first step in a
planned larger annotation of “grounding” and should allow us to select a subset of these
“dictionaries” that seem to cover any given text reasonably well and show an acceptable
level of inter-annotator agreement.
We present a pilot study of a web-based annotation of words with senses.
The annotated senses come from several knowledge bases and sense inventories.

We present a thorough analysis of a combination of a statistical and a transfer-based system for English->Czech translation, Moses and TectoMT.
We describe several techniques for inspecting such a system combination which are based both on automatic and manual evaluation.
While TectoMT often produces bad translations, Moses is still able to select the good parts of them.
In many cases, TectoMT provides useful novel translations which are otherwise simply unavailable to the statistical component, despite the very large training data.
Our analyses confirm the expected behaviour that TectoMT helps with preserving grammatical agreements and valency requirements, but that it also improves a very diverse set of other phenomena.
Interestingly, including the outputs of the
transfer-based system in the phrase-based search seems to have a positive effect on the search space.
Overall, we find that the components of this combination are complementary and the final system produces significantly better translations than either component by itself.
We present a feature-rich discriminative model for machine translation which uses an abstract semantic representation on the source side.
We include our model as an additional feature in a phrase-based decoder and we show modest gains in BLEU score in an n-best re-ranking experiment.
This work focuses on aspect-based sentiment analysis, a relatively recent task in natural language processing.
We present a new dataset for Czech aspect-based sentiment analysis which consists of segments from user reviews of IT products.
We also describe our work in progress on the task of aspect term extraction.
We believe that this area can be of interest to other workshop participants and that this paper can inspire a fruitful discussion on the topic with researchers from related fields.
Parsito is a fast open-source dependency parser written in C++.
Parsito is based on greedy transition-based parsing, it has very high accuracy and achieves a throughput of 30K words per second.
Parsito can be trained on any input data without feature engineering, because it utilizes artificial neural network classifier.
Trained models for all treebanks from Universal Dependencies project are available (37 treebanks as of Dec 2015).
MorphoDiTa: Morphological Dictionary and Tagger is an open-source tool for morphological analysis of natural language texts.
It performs morphological analysis, morphological generation, tagging and tokenization and is distributed as a standalone tool or a library, along with trained linguistic models.
In the Czech language, MorphoDiTa achieves state-of-the-art results with a throughput around 10-200K words per second.
MorphoDiTa is a free software under LGPL license and the linguistic models are free for non-commercial use and distributed under CC BY-NC-SA license, although for some models the original data used to create the model may impose additional licensing conditions.
We describe a transition-based, non-projective dependency parser which uses a neural network classifier for prediction and requires no feature engineering.
We propose a new, search-based oracle, which improves parsing accuracy similarly to a dynamic oracle, but is applicable to any transition system, such as the fully non-projective swap system.
The parser has excellent parsing speed, compact models, and achieves high accuracy without requiring any additional resources such as raw corpora.
We tested it on all 19 treebanks of the Universal Dependencies project.
The C++ implementation of the parser is being released as an open-source tool.
With an increasing amount of data and services available in the LINDAT/CLARIN infrastructure comes the need to properly cite, share, cross-reference and gather usage statistics.
We introduce a framework that ensures a consistent look and the mentioned functionality.
Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and more specifically, semantic parsing is an indispensable task in each speech-enabled application.
In this survey, we review the current research on SLU and semantic parsing with emphasis on machine learning techniques used for these tasks.
Observing the current trends in semantic parsing, we conclude our discussion by suggesting some of the most promising future research trends.
This doctoral thesis is devoted to linguistic analysis of discourse relations as one of the aspects of discourse coherence.
Discourse relations are semantic relations holding between propositions in a discourse (discourse arguments).
The aim of the thesis is a complex description of discourse relations in Czech and its application in an annotation scheme in the Prague Dependency Treebank.
The thesis is divided into three parts: The first one is focused on the theoretical description of discourse relations and on analysis of adequacy of various methodological concepts in corpus processing.
The second part describes in detail the proposed scheme for the annotation of discourse relations and the process of the corpus build-up including the evaluation of consistency of the annotated data.
Finally, in the last part of the thesis, we address some problematic issues arisen with the employment the proposed scheme and look for their possible solutions.
Scene Text Recognition (STR) is a task of localizing and transcribing textual information captured in real-word images.
With its increasing accuracy, it becomes a new source of textual data for standard Natural Language Processing tasks and poses new problems because of the specific nature of Scene Text.
In this paper, we learn a string hypotheses decoding procedure in an STR pipeline using structured prediction methods that proved to be useful in automatic Speech Recognition and Machine Translation.
The model allow to employ
a wide range of typographical and language features into the decoding process.
The proposed method is evaluated on a standard dataset and improves both character and word recognition performance over the baseline.
In this thesis we analyze machine translation between Czech and Russian languages from the perspective of a linguist.
We explore the output of our two experimental systems and two commercial systems: PC Translator and Google Translate.
We make a linguistically-motivated classification of errors for the language pair and describe each type of error in detail, analyzing whether it occurred due to some difference between Czech and Russian or is it caused by the system architecture.
In particular, we focus on one specific error type - surface valency.
We present a novel knowledge based dialog system that learns from
interactions with users.
It asks users for advice about unknown questions and
generalizes them according to its knowledge base.
The dialog system was evaluated
through the CrowdFlower crowdsourcing platform and it showed the ability to adapt
without any prior information except the knowledge base.
The purpose of our work is to explore the possibility of using sentence diagrams produced by schoolchildren as training data for automatic syntactic analysis.
We have implemented a sentence diagram editor that schoolchildren can use to practice morphology and syntax.
We collect their diagrams, combine them into a single diagram for each sentence and transform them into a form suitable for training a particular syntactic parser.
In this study, the object language is Czech, where sentence diagrams are part of elementary school curriculum, and the target format is the annotation scheme of the Prague Dependency Treebank.
We mainly focus on the evaluation of individual diagrams and on their combination into a merged better version.
The paper deals with word order of inner participants (Actor and Patient) in the focus-part of Czech sentences.
The analysis of the sequence of Actor and Patient reveals the criteria that may influence the arrangement of sentence participants as such.
The paper deals with the established scale of contextual boundness of subordinate clauses in Czech and describes the reasons why some types of categories are more often presented as known then others by the Czech writers.
This survey serves as an illustration of equalization tendency in typologically different languages, using constructional analysis of structures containing adcollocational verbal idioms.
This contribution describes improvements of opinion target identification in sentiment analysis, employing methods from quantitative linguistics, namely thematic concentration of the text.
Although sentiment analysis has been gaining a booming interest recently, most experiments use only plain text corpora.
This poster shows that an existing richly annotated Prague Dependency Treebank can be exploited as a source of valuable information important for various opinion mining subtasks.
When deploying a spoken dialogue system in a new domain, one faces a situation where little to no data is available to train domain-specific statistical models.
We describe our experience with bootstrapping a dialogue system for public transit and weather information in real-word deployment under public use.
We proceeded incrementally, starting from a minimal system put on a toll-free telephone number to collect speech data.
We were able to incorporate statistical modules trained on collected data – in-domain speech recognition language models and spoken language understanding – while simultaneously extending the domain, making use of automatically generated semantic annotation.
Our approach shows that a successful system can be built with minimal effort and no in-domain data at hand.
This package contains data sets for development and testing of machine translation of sentences from summaries of medical articles between Czech, English, French, and German.
The WMT 2014 Medical Translation Task poses an interesting challenge for Machine Translation
(MT).
In the standard translation task, the end application is the translation itself.
In this task, the MT system is considered a part of a larger system for cross-lingual information retrieval (IR).

Roland Wagner’s contribution published in the last volume of the PBML journal – focusing
(among other ideas) on the role of Czech reflexives – presents several critical remarks concerning the Functional Generative Description.
These remarks represent a good challenge for the
authors developing this model to fill empirical gaps and to make clear some theoretical presuppositions concerning valency frames of verbs and their respective reflexive counterparts that are primarily addressed by RW’s critical survey.
We define broad-coverage semantic dependency parsing as the task of recovering sentence-internal predicate-argument relationships for all content words i.e.
a semantic dependency structure that constitutes the core structure of sentence meaning.
We present two recently released open-source taggers: NameTag is a free software for named entity recognition (NER) which achieves state-of-the-art performance on Czech; MorphoDiTa (Morphological Dictionary and Tagger) performs morphological analysis (with lemmatization), morphological generation, tagging and tokenization with state-of-the-art results for Czech and a throughput around 10-200K words per second.
The taggers can be trained for any language for which annotated data exist, but they are specifically designed to be efficient for inflective languages.
Both tools are free software
under LGPL license and are distributed along with trained linguistic models which are free for non-commercial use under the CC BY-NC-SA license.
The releases include standalone tools, C++ libraries with Java, Python and Perl bindings and web services.
In this paper, we describe our participation in the Search part of the Search and Hyperlinking Task in MediaEval Benchmark 2014.
In our experiments, we compare two types of segmentation: fixed-length segmentation and segmentation employing Decision Trees on various features.
We also show usefulness of exploiting metadata and explore removal of overlapping retrieved segments.
As a submission of its own to the open track of Task 8 at SemEval 2014, a subset of the organizers sought to connect the task to pre-existing, ‘in-house’ parsing systems that can output the same types of semantic dependency graphs as used in the task.
For each of the three target formats, there is an existing parsing system, which typically was developed in parallel to the creation of the target dependency graphs, viz.
(a) for the DM format, the parser using the hand-engineered English Resource Grammar; (b) for the PAS format, the Enju parsing system, with its probabilistic HPSG acquired through linguistic projection of the PTB; and (c) for the PCEDT format, the scenario for English tectogrammatical analysis within the Treex framework, comprising a pipeline of a syntactical data-driven dependency parser and a number of hand-engineered processing blocks that convert trees from the analytical to the tectogrammatical layer.
In this paper, we describe a release of a sizeable monolingual Urdu corpus automatically tagged with part-of-speech tags.
We extend the work of Jawaid and Bojar (2012) who use three different taggers and then apply a voting scheme to
disambiguate among the different choices suggested by each tagger.
We run this complex ensemble on a large monolingual
corpus and release the tagged corpus.
Additionally, we use this data to train a single standalone tagger which will
hopefully significantly simplify Urdu processing.
The standalone tagger obtains the accuracy of 88.74% on test data.
Poster summarizing the basic information on Malach Center for Visual History, its activities and available archival resources.
Various attempts to conceptualize the often vaguely used term collective memory come to the conclusion that collective memory is deeply related to linguistic and narrative phenomena.
In the present paper, I aim to provide an overview and discussion of the link between language and collective memory in the context of social theory.
In the case of the founding theoretical figures, M. Halbwachs and J. Assmann, the importance of language in relation to the issues of collective memory is profound.
In the past two decades, the specific role of narrative and conversation had become an important subject in researching collective memory.
In empirical research, on the other hand, the relationship of language and collective memory seems to be rather underrepresented.
Various fields and disciplines deal with similar topics quite differently, and they also differ in the degree of explicit scrutiny of the collective memory phenomena.
The technical report presents the guidelines for manual annotation of nominal coreference in the Prague Czech-English Treebank.
This paper describes Parmesan, our submission to the 2014 Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation (WMT) metrics task for evaluation English-to-Czech translation.
We show that the Czech Meteor Paraphrase tables are so noisy that they actually can harm
the performance of the metric.
However, they can be very useful after extensive filtering
in targeted paraphrasing of Czech reference sentences prior to the evaluation.
Parmesan first performs targeted paraphrasing of reference sentences, then it computes
the Meteor score using only the exact match on~these new reference sentences.
It shows
significantly higher correlation with human judgment than Meteor on the WMT12 and WMT13 data.
We present a method for improving machine translation (MT) evaluation by targeted
paraphrasing of reference sentences.
For this purpose, we employ MT systems themselves
and adapt them for translating within a single language.
We describe this attempt on two types of MT systems -- phrase-based and rule-based.
Initially, we experiment with the freely available SMT system Moses.
We create translation
models from two available sources of Czech paraphrases -- Czech WordNet and the Meteor
Paraphrase tables.
We extended Moses by a new feature that makes the translation targeted.
However, the results of this method are inconclusive.
In the view of errors appearing
in the new paraphrased sentences, we propose another solution -- targeted paraphrasing
using parts of a rule-based translation system included in the NLP framework Treex.
This report describes the participation of the team of Charles University in Prague at the ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab in 2014.
We present an extension of the Kaldi automatic speech recognition toolkit to support on-line speech recognition.
The resulting recogniser supports acoustic models trained using state-of-the-art acoustic modelling techniques.
(MFCC, MLLT+LDA, BMMI) As the recogniser produces word posterior lattices, it is particularly useful in statistical dialogue systems, which try to exploit uncertainty in the recogniser's output.
The evaluation is focused on on-line speech recognition in a dialogue system Alex for the "public Czech transportation" domain.
The dialogue system is available at a public toll-free 800 899 998 line.

An overview of problems caused in MT by rich target-side morphology, and our techniques of addressing them.
We present various achievements in statistical machine translation from English, German, Spanish and French into Czech.
We discuss specific properties of the individual source languages and
describe techniques that exploit these properties and address language-specific errors.
Besides the translation proper, we also present our contribution to error analysis.
This paper presents the results of the
WMT14 shared tasks, which included a
standard news translation task, a separate
medical translation task, a task for
run-time estimation of machine translation
quality, and a metrics task.
This year, 143
machine translation systems from 23 institutions
were submitted to the ten translation
directions in the standard translation
task.
An additional 6 anonymized systems
were included, and were then evaluated
both automatically and manually.
The
quality estimation task had four subtasks,
with a total of 10 teams, submitting 57 entries.
We present HindEnCorp, a parallel corpus of Hindi and English, and HindMonoCorp, a monolingual corpus of Hindi in their release version 0.5.
Both corpora were collected from web sources and preprocessed primarily for the training of statistical machine translation systems.
HindEnCorp consists of 274k parallel sentences (3.9 million Hindi and 3.8 million English tokens).
HindMonoCorp amounts to 787 million tokens in 44 million sentences.
Both the corpora are freely available for non-commercial research and their preliminary release has been used by numerous participants of the WMT 2014 shared translation task.
We presented an overview of the work of our department, highlighting NLP tools useful in text analytics.

This paper compares Czech and English annotation using Abstract Meaning Represantation formalism.
The aim of the paper is threefold.
First, it introduces the current version of the annotation tool for discourse relations in the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.0.
Second, it presents the discourse relations in the treebank themselves, including new additions in comparison with the
previous release.
And third, it shows how to search in the treebank, with focus on the discourse
relations.
The goal of the present contribution is rather modest: to collect simple statistics carried out on different layers of the annotation scenario of the Prague Dependency Treebank in order to illustrate their usefulness for linguistic research, either by supporting existing hypotheses or suggesting new research questions or new explanations of the existing ones.
For this purpose, we have collected the data from the already published papers on PDT (quoted at the relevant places), adding some more recent results and drawing some more general consequences relevant for Czech grammar writers.

We present HamleDT – a HArmonized Multi-LanguagE Dependency Treebank.
HamleDT is a compilation of existing dependency treebanks (or dependency conversions of other treebanks), transformed so that they all conform to the same annotation style.
In the present article, we provide
a thorough investigation and discussion of a number of phenomena that are comparable across languages, though their annotation in treebanks often differs.
We claim that transformation procedures can be designed to automatically identify most such phenomena and convert them to a unified annotation style.
This unification is beneficial both to comparative corpus linguistics
and to machine learning of syntactic parsing.
Technical report provides new annotation rules for annotation of czech text on tectogrammatical level of the Prague Dependency Treebanks.
The rules supplement main annotation manual (ÚFAL/CKL TR-2005-28) and were formed with respect to annotation of PCEDT 2.0 and PDTSC 2.0.

The paper discusses a~set of verbal prefixes which, when added to a~verb together with a~reflexive morpheme,
change the verb's meaning always in the same manner.
The prefixes form a~sequence according to the degree of intensity with which they modify the verbal action.
We present the process of verb intensification in three Slavic languages, namely Czech, Slovak and Russian.
This paper presents the fully automatic linking of two valency lexicons of Czech verbs: VALLEX and PDT-VALLEX.
Despite the same theoretical background adopted by these lexicons and the same linguistic phenomena they focus on, the fully automatic mapping of these resouces is not straightforward.
We demonstrate that converting these lexicons into a common format represents a relatively easy part of the task whereas the automatic identification of pairs of corresponding valency frames (representing lexical units of verbs) poses difficulties.
The overall achieved precision of 81% can be considered satisfactory.
However, the higher number of lexical units a verb has, the lower the precision of their automatic mapping usually is.
Moreover, we show that especially (i) supplementing further information on lexical units and (ii) revealing and reconciling regular discrepancies in their annotations can greatly assist in the automatic merging.

This paper describes the Alex Dialogue Systems Framework (ADSF).
The ADSF currently includes mature components for public telephone network connectivity, voice activity detection, automatic speech recognition, statistical spoken language understanding, and probabilistic belief tracking.
The ADSF is used in a real-world deployment within the Public Transport Information (PTI) domain.
In PTI, users can interact with a dialogue system on the phone to find intra- and inter-city public transport connections and ask for weather forecast in a desired city.
Based on user responses, vast majority of the system users are satisfied with the system performance.

There is a collection of 30 treebanks (HamleDT) and more treebanks exist, but there are about 7000 languages in the world, and it seems impractical to build treebanks for all of these.
Therefore, I propose to explore the possibilities of semi-supervised parsing (probably via multisource projection).
Also, I suggest generally adding more fuzziness to input features (especially morphological tags).
We present HamleDT 2.0 (HArmonized Multi-LanguagE Dependency Treebank).
HamleDT 2.0 is a collection of 30 existing treebanks harmonized into a common annotation style, the Prague Dependencies, and further transformed into Stanford Dependencies, a treebank annotation style that became popular recently.
We use the newest basic Universal Stanford Dependencies, without added language-specific subtypes.
We describe both of the annotation styles, including adjustments that were necessary to make, and provide details about the conversion process.
We also discuss the differences between the two styles, evaluating their advantages and disadvantages, and note the effects of the differences on the conversion.
We regard the stanfordization as generally successful, although we admit several shortcomings, especially in the distinction between direct and indirect objects, that have to be addressed in future.
We release part of HamleDT 2.0 freely; we are not allowed to redistribute the whole dataset, but we do provide the conversion pipeline.
Key to fast adaptation of language technologies for any language hinges on the availability of fundamental tools and resources such as monolingual/parallel corpora, annotated corpora, part-of-speech (POS) taggers, parsers and so on.
The languages which lack those fundamental resources are often referred as under-resourced
languages.
In this thesis, we address the problem of cross-lingual dependency parsing of under-resourced languages.
We apply three methodologies to induce dependency structures: (i) projecting dependencies from a resource-rich language to under-resourced languages via parallel corpus word alignment links (ii) parsing under-
resourced languages using parsers whose models are trained on treebanks of other
languages, and do not look at actual word forms, but only on POS categories.
Here
we address the problem of incompatibilities in annotation styles between source side parsers and target side evaluation treebanks by harmonizing annotations to a common standard; and finally (iii) we add a new under-resourced scenario in which we use machine translated parallel corpora instead of human translated corpora for
projecting dependencies to under-resourced languages.
We apply the aforementioned methodologies to five Indian languages (ILs): Hindi, Urdu, Telugu, Bengali and Tamil (in the order of high to low availability of treebank data).
To make the evaluation possible for Tamil, we develop a depen
dency treebank resource for Tamil from scratch and we use the created data in
evaluation and as a source in parsing other ILs.
Finally, we list out strategies that
can be used to obtain dependency structures for target languages under different
resource-poor scenarios.
This paper revisits the projection-based approach to dependency grammar induction task.
Traditional cross-lingual dependency induction tasks one way or the other, depend on the existence
of bitexts or target language tools such as part-of-speech (POS) taggers to obtain reasonable
parsing accuracy.
In this paper, we transfer dependency parsers using only approximate
resources, i.e., machine translated bitexts instead of manually created bitexts.
We do this by
obtaining the the source side of the text from a machine translation (MT) system and then apply
transfer approaches to induce parser for the target languages.
We further reduce the need
for the availability of labeled target language resources by using unsupervised target tagger.
We show that our approach consistently outperforms unsupervised parsers by a bigger margin
(8.2% absolute), and results in similar performance when compared with delexicalized transfer
parsers.
One of the most important aspect of cross-lingual dependency transfer
is how different annotation styles which often underestimate the parsing accuracy are handled.
The emerging trend is that the annotation style of different language treebanks can be
harmonized into one style and the cumbersome manual transformation rules thus can be avoided.
In this paper, we use harmonized treebanks (POS tagsets and dependency structures of original
treebanks mapped to a common style)  for inducing dependencies in a cross-lingual setting.
We transfer dependencies using delexicalized parsers that use harmonized version of the original treebanks.
We apply this approach to five Indian languages (Hindi, Urdu, Telugu, Bengali and Tamil) and show that
best performance can be obtained in delexicalized parsing when the transfer takes place from Indian language (IL) to IL treebanks.
This paper presents the results of task 3 of the ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2014 focused on user-centred health information retrieval.
We address the task of reference detection and classification in Czech court decisions.
This task is a typical named-entity recognition task where the entities are references (links) to other documents.
We apply a supervised machine learning approach, namely Hidden Markov Models.
A supervised methodology requires manual annotation of training data so we annotated 300 court decisions.

This paper describes an attempt to solve the problem of recognizing clauses and their mutual relationship in complex Czech sentences on the basis of limited information, namely the information obtained by morphological analysis only.
The method described in this paper may be used in the future for splitting the parsing process into two phases, namely 1) Recognizing clauses and their mutual relationships; and 2) Parsing the individual clauses.
This approach should be able to improve the result of parsing long complex sentences.
The paper focuses on various possibilities of expressing textual relations in Czech.
This possibility is held mainly by
discourse connectives but also by their
alternatives lexicalizations like "the reason is".
The aim of the presentation was to examine broader possibilities of expressing textual
relations, in other words which language means (apart from “classic” connectives like "and" or
"however") have an ability to signal certain relation between two units within a text.
The presentation described results of the research on discourse connectives in broader sense based on  corpus probe (Prague Dependency Treebank; corpus DIALOG).
The paper introduces a possibility of new research offered by a multi-dimensional annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank.
It focuses on exploitation of the annotation of coreference for the annotation of discourse relations expressed by multiword expressions.
It tries to find which as-pect interlinks these linguistic areas and how we can use this interplay in automatic searching for Czech expressions like "despite this" ("navzdory tomu"), "because of this fact" ("díky této skutečnosti") functioning as multiword discourse markers.
We present our English→Czech and

This paper describes a machine translation metric submitted to the WMT14 Metrics Task.
It is a simple modification of the standard BLEU metric using a monolingual alignment of reference and test sentences.
The alignment is computed as a minimum weighted maximum bipartite matching of the translated and the reference sentence words with respect to the relative edit distance of the word prefixes and suffixes.
The aligned words are included in the n-gram precision computation with a penalty proportional to the matching distance.
The proposed tBLEU metric is designed to be more tolerant to errors in inflection, which usually does not effect the understandability of a sentence, and therefore be more suitable for measuring quality of translation into morphologically richer languages.
The course will introduce the students to the methods of processing morphology of natural languages.
It starts with a linguistic overview of morphology, discussing features of a wide variety of languages including fusional languages such as German and Czech and agglutinative such as Turkish and Esperanto.
After that, a discussion of corpora, tagsets and annotation will follow.
The core of the course covers supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods of morphological analysis, morpheme segmentation, lexicon creation, etc.
The course covers standard and well established methods (two level morphology, Porter stemmer), but also includes discussion of recent important papers, for example, Yarowsky & Wicentowski 2000, Creutz and Lagus 2007, Monson 2009, and Tepper & Xia 2010.
Even though the quality of unsupervised
dependency parsers grows, they often fail
in recognition of very basic dependencies.
In this paper, we exploit a prior knowledge
of STOP-probabilities (whether a given
word has any children in a given direction), which is obtained from a large raw
corpus using the reducibility principle.
By
incorporating this knowledge into Dependency Model with Valence, we managed to
considerably outperform the state-of-the-art results in terms of average attachment
score over 20 treebanks from CoNLL 2006
and 2007 shared tasks.
In this report we explore alternative representations of coordination structures within dependency trees and study the impact of particular solutions on performance of two selected state-of-the-art dependency parsers across a typologically diverse range of languages.
We present an introduction to the problem of Natural Language Generation (NLG) an give a brief survey of recent advances in this field, focusing on the usage of statistical methods.
Most stress is put on NLG within Spoken Dialogue Systems, but other usage areas are included as well.
The paper concludes with an overview of problems posed by the development of a multilingual NLG system for a Spoken Dialogue System.
We present a novel method of statistical morphological generation, i.e.
the prediction  of  inflected  word  forms  given lemma, part-of-peech and morphological features, aimed at robustness to unseen inputs.
Our system uses a trainable classifier to predict “edit scripts” that are then used to transform lemmas into inflected word forms.
Suffixes of lemmas are included as features to achieve robustness.
We evaluate our system on 6 languages with a varying degree of morphological richness.
The results show that the system is able to learn most morphological phenomena and generalize to unseen  inputs, producing significantly better results than a dictionary-based baseline.
We present the concept of a correspondence seminar as a way to complement and support one-time contests, especially olympiads.
We evaluate specific payoffs of this way of teaching linguistics, and compare its nature to that of a linguistics olympiad.
We believe that the correspondence seminar is a great way to introduce talented high school students to linguistics.
We present a new named entity recognizer for the Czech language.
It reaches 82.82 F-measure on the Czech Named Entity Corpus 1.0 and significantly outperforms previously published Czech named entity recognizers.
On the English CoNLL-2003 shared task, we achieved 89.16 F-measure, reaching comparable results to the English state of the art.
The recognizer is based on Maximum Entropy Markov Model and a Viterbi algorithm decodes an optimal sequence labeling using probabilities estimated by a maximum entropy classifier.
The classification features utilize morphological analysis, two-stage prediction, word clustering and gazetteers.
A new version of the Czech corpus with manually annotated named entities, classified using a rich hierarchy of types.
We describe our experiments with phrase-based machine translation for the WMT 2013 Shared Task.
We trained one system for 18 translation directions between English or Czech on one side and English, Czech, German, Spanish, French or Russian on the other side.
We describe a set of results with different training data sizes and subsets.
For the pairs containing Russian, we describe a set of independent experiments with slightly different
translation models.
We describe our approach to the Search Subtask of the Search and Hyperlinking Task at MediaEval 2013.
We experiment with various methods for segmentation of the recordings into shorter segments which are then used in a standard
retrieval setup to search for relevant passages.
We use regular segmentation into equilong segments and experiment with machine-learning based segmentation expanding our approach to Similar Segments in Social Spech Task.
An interview on machine translation and a new book that introduces the field to the Czech reader.
There is increasing interest in and need for innovative solutions to medical search.
In this paper we present the EU-funded Khresmoi medical search and access system, currently in year 3 of 4 of development across 12 partners.
The Khresmoi system uses a component-based architecture housed in the cloud to allow for the development of several innovative applications to support target users' medical information needs.
The Khresmoi search systems based on this architecture have been designed to support the multilingual and multimodal information needs of three target groups: the general public, general practitioners and consultant radiologists.
In this paper we focus on the presentation of the systems to support the latter two groups using semantic, multilingual text and image-based (including 2D and 3D radiology images) search.
This paper discusses the problem of annotation
of  coreference  relations  with  generic
expressions in a large scale corpus.
We present
and  analyze  some  existing  theories  of
genericity,  compare  them  to  the  approaches  to generics  that  are  used  in  the  state-of-the-art coreference  annotation  guidelines  and  discuss how  coreference  of  generic  expressions  is processed  in  the  manual  annotation  of  the Prague  Dependency  Treebank.
After  analyzing some  typical  problematic  issues  we  propose some  partial  solutions  that  can  be  used  to enhance  the  quality  and  consistency  of  the annotation
We present the results of the coreference and bridging annotation in the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0.
The annotation is carried out on dependency trees (on the tectogrammatical layer).
We describe the inter-annotator agreement measurement, classify and analyse the most common types of annotators’ disagreement.
On two selected long texts,  we asked the annotators to mark the degree of certainty they have in some most problematic points; we compare the results to the inter-annotator agreement measurement.
We explore the benefits of dependency trees and tectogrammatical structure used in the Prague Dependency Treebank for annotating language phenomena that cross the sentence boundary, namely coreference and bridging relations.
We present the benefits of dependency trees such as the detailed processing of ellipses, syntactic decisions for coordination and apposition structures that make possible coding coreference relations in cases that are not so easy when annotating on the raw texts.
This is the PyKaldi - release 2013.
This code include modification of the gmm-lat-gen-faster decoder so that it can be used for online decoding.
The modification based on a light weight modification to the original code by subclassing the main decoder class and adding online processing of input, including LDA+MLLT transforamtions.
In addtition, this code includes a Python wrapper so that the decoder can be used from any python application.
This paper describes our WMT submissions CU-BOJAR and CU-DEPFIX, the latter
dubbed "chimera" because it combines on three diverse approaches: TectoMT, a system
with transfer at the deep syntactic level of representation, factored
phrase-based translation using Moses, and finally automatic rule-based correction
of frequent grammatical and meaning errors.
We do not use any off-the-shelf system-combination method.
One of the key obstacles in automatic evaluation of machine translation systems is the reliance on a few (typically just one) human-made reference translations to which the system output is compared.
We propose a method of capturing millions of possible translations and implement a tool for translators to specify them using a compact representation.
We evaluate this new type of reference set by edit distance and correlation to human judgements of translation quality.
We present eman, a tool for managing large numbers of computational experiments.
Over
the years of our research in machine translation (MT), we have collected a couple of ideas for
efficient experimenting.
We believe these ideas are generally applicable in (computational)
research of any field.
We incorporated them into eman in order to make them available in a
command-line Unix environment.
The aim of this article is to highlight the core of the many ideas.
We hope the text can serve
as a collection of experiment management tips and tricks for anyone, regardless their field of
study or computer platform they use.
The specific examples we provide in eman’s current syntax
are less important but they allow us to use concrete terms.
The article thus also fills the gap in eman documentation by providing some high-level overview.
A summary of the life achievements of a well-known Czech linguist and slavisist prof. L. Matejka, who was an important propagator of Czech linguistics and Czech culture in general in international community.
About a great Czech linguist Vilém Mathesius and his scientific contribution, in particular, about  his functional sentence perspective.
The objective of the present contribution is to give a survey of the annotation of information structure in the Czech part of the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank.
We report on this first step in the process of building a parallel annotation of information structure in this corpus, and elaborate on the automatic pre-annotation procedure for the Czech part.
The results of the pre-annotation are evaluated, based on the comparison of the automatic and manual annotation.
The Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank, version 1.5 (PADT 1.5) is a collection of  texts in Modern Standard Arabic, entiched with morphological and analytical (surface-syntax dependency) annotation.
Our goal is to predict the ﬁrst language (L1)
of English essays’s authors with the help of
the TOEFL11 corpus where L1, prompts (topics) and proﬁciency levels are provided.
Thus
we approach this task as a classiﬁcation task
employing machine learning methods.
Out
of key concepts of machine learning, we focus on feature engineering.
We design features across all the L1 languages not making
use of knowledge of prompt and proﬁciency
level.
During system development, we experimented with various techniques for feature ﬁltering and combination optimized with respect
to the notion of mutual information and information gain.
We trained four different SVM
models and combined them through majority
voting achieving accuracy 72.5%.
The phenomenon of word order freedom plays
an important role in syntactic analysis of many natural languages.
This paper introduces a notion of a word order shift, an operation reflecting the degree of word order freedom of natural languages.
The word order shift is an operation
based upon word order changes preserving syntactic
correctness, individual word forms, their morphological characteristics, and their surface dependency relations in a course of a stepwise simplification of a sentence, a so called analysis by reduction.
The paper provides linguistic motivation for this operation and concentrates on a formal description of the whole mechanism through a special class of automata, so called restarting automata with the shift operation enhanced with
a structured output, and their computations.
The goal of this study is to clarify the properties of computations needed to perform (enhanced) analysis by reduction for free word order languages.
Wikipedia is not only a large encyclopedia, but
lately also a source of linguistic data for various applications.
Individual language versions allow to get the parallel data in multiple languages.
Inclusion of Wikipedia articles into categories can be used to filter the language data according to a domain.
In our project, we needed a large number of parallel data for training systems of machine translation in the field of biomedicine.
One of the sources was Wikipedia.
To select the data from the given domain we used the results of
the DBpedia project, which extracts structured information from the Wikipedia articles and makes them available to users in RDF format.
In this paper we describe the process of data extraction and the problems that we had to deal with, because the open source project like Wikipedia, to which anyone can contribute, is not very reliable concerning consistency.
In Czech and in Russian there is a set of prefixes changing the meaning of imperfective verbs always in the same manner.
The change often (in Czech always) demands adding a reflexive morpheme.
This feature can be used for automatic recognition of words, without the need to store them in morphological dictionaries.
The paper aims at the investigation of the phenomenon of free word order.
It concentrates on the relationship between (formal) dependencies and word order.
The investigation is performed by means of a semiautomatic application of a method of analysis by reduction to Czech syntactically annotated data.
The freedom of word order is expressed by means of a number of necessary shifts in the process of analysis by reduction.
The paper shows that this measure provides a new view of the problem, it is orthogonal to measures reflecting the word order freedom based on a number of non-projective constructions or clitics in a sentence.
The paper describes a method of identifying a set of interesting constructions in a syntactically annotated corpus of Czech (the Prague Dependency Treebank) by application of an automatic procedure
of analysis by reduction to the trees in the treebank.
The procedure reveals certain linguistic phenomena that go beyond `dependency
nature'.
The paper contains discussion and analysis of individual phenomena, as well as the quantification of results of the automatic procedure on a subset of the treebank.
In the present paper, central ideas of the work on productivity by the Czech linguist Miloš Dokulil are presented and placed in the context of recent approaches to productivity.
Based on material from large corpora of Czech, productivity of four Czexh suffixes (-ost, -ství/ctví, -ismus, -ita) is analyzed; it is demonstrated that productivity measures used for quantification of productivity give different results.
A tutorial describing PML-TQ, a tool for searching syntactically annotated corpora.
Two forms of the client interface were presented, with examples over Czech, English, and German data.
We present Depfix, a system for automatic post-editing of phrase-based English-to-Czech machine translation outputs, based on linguistic knowledge.
First, we analyzed the types of errors that a typical machine translation system makes.
Then, we created a set of rules and a statistical component that correct errors that are common or serious and can have a potential to be corrected by our approach.
We use a range of natural language processing tools to provide us with analyses of the input sentences.
Moreover, we reimplemented the dependency parser and adapted it in several ways to parsing of statistical machine translation outputs.
We performed both automatic and manual evaluations which confirmed that our system improves the quality of the translations.

Some things are hard for PB SMT -- negation, agreement, passives...
Automatic post-editing can often help -- a handful of simple rules might do the job very well.
NLP tools are typically useful -- tagger, parser, morphological generator; adapt them to SMT outputs if possible.
Deepfix is a statistical post-editing system for improving
the quality of statistical machine
translation outputs.
It attempts to correct errors in verb-noun valency using deep syntactic
analysis and a simple probabilistic model of valency.
On the English-to-Czech translation pair, we show that statistical post-editing of
statistical machine translation
leads to
an improvement
of the translation quality when helped by deep linguistic knowledge.
TamilTB 1.0 improves over the very first release of the Tamil dependency treebank (TamilTB v0.1).
The current version introduces many improvements over the orthography and morphological tagset of the data.
Now, the primary data representation of the treebank uses UTF-8 encoding.
We present our initial steps towards a linguistic processing of texts to detect semantic relations there.
Our work is an essential part of the INTLIB project whose aim is to provide a more efficient and user-friendly tool for querying textual documents other than full-text search.
This tool is proposed as a general framework which can be modified and extended for particular data domains.
Currently, we focus on Czech legal texts.
We present the application JTagger which detects references in court decisions and the application RExtractor which extracts relations between entities from Czech laws.

This tool is proposed as a general framework which can be modified and extended for particular data domains.
Currently, we focus on Czech legal texts.
We address the task of reference detection and classification in Czech court decisions.
This task is a typical named-entity recognition task where the entities are references (links) to other documents.
We apply a supervised machine learning approach, namely Hidden Markov Models.
A supervised methodology requires manual annotation of training data so we annotated 300 court decisions.
This report describes Addicter, tool for automatic error detection and evaluation, providing its user also with graphical interface useful for browsing through the dataset.
Description of text annotations and some selected problems of the annotations (annotation on dependency trees and on a plain text; the discrepancy between syntactic structure and discourse structure; an unexpressed thought as a discourse argument)
Current methods for statistical machine translation typically utilize only a
limited context in the input sentence.
Many language phenomena thus remain out
of their reach, for example long-distance agreement in morphologically rich
languages or lexical selection often require information from the whole source
sentence.
In this work, we present an overview of approaches for including wider
context in SMT and describe our first experiments.
We present a web service which handles and distributes JSON-encoded HTTP
requests for machine translation (MT) among multiple machines running
an MT system, including text pre- and post processing.
It is currently used to provide MT between several languages
for cross-lingual information retrieval in the Khresmoi project.
The software consists of an application server and remote workers which handle
text processing and communicate translation requests to MT
systems.
The communication between the application server and the workers is
based on the XML-RPC protocol.
We present
the overall design of the software and test results which document
speed and scalability of our solution.
Our software is licensed under the Apache 2.0 licence and is available for
download from the Lindat-Clarin repository and Github.
We give a brief introduction to phrase-based machine translation and the Moses toolkit.
We present Eman, an experiment manager, and show how to use it to train several simple MT systems.

Treex is a framework for NLP tools.
NIF (NLP Interchange format) is an RDF/OWL-based format that aims to achieve interoperability between NLP tools, language resources and annotations.
The presentation describes Treex and other tools/treebanks developed at ÚFAL.
It focuses on its similarities and differences compared to NIF (and the NLP2RDF initiative).
Paratactic syntactic structures are notoriously
difficult to represent in dependency formalisms, which has painful consequences such as high frequency of parsing errors related to coordination.
In other words, coordination is a pending problem in dependency analysis of natural languages.
This paper tries to shed some light
on this area by bringing a systematizing view of various formal means developed for encoding coordination structures.
We introduce a novel taxonomy of such approaches and apply it on treebanks across a typologically diverse range of 26 languages.
Empirical observations on convertibility between selected styles of representations are shown too.

In the present paper, we describe in detail and evaluate the process of semi-automatic annotation of intra-sentential discourse relations in the Prague Dependency Treebank, which is a part of the project of otherwise mostly manual annotation of all (intra- and inter-sentential) discourse relations with explicit connectives in the treebank.
The rich annotation of the treebank allowed us to automatically detect the intra-sentential discourse relations, their connectives and arguments in most of the cases.
This chapter described data-driven methods suitable for development of spoken language understanding components in dialogue systems.
Unsupervised dependency parsing is an alternative approach to identifying relations
between words in a sentence.
It does not require any annotated treebank, it
is independent of language theory and universal across languages.
However, so far
quite low parsing quality is its main disadvantage.
This thesis discusses some previous works and introduces a novel approach to
unsupervised parsing.
Our dependency model consists of four submodels: (i) edge
model, which controls the distribution of governor-dependent pairs, (ii) fertility
model, which controls the number of node's dependents, (iii) distance model, which
controls the length of the dependency edges, and (iv) reducibility model.
The reducibility
model is based on a hypothesis that words that can be removed from a
sentence without violating its grammaticality are leaves in the dependency tree.
Induction of the dependency structures is done using Gibbs sampling method.
We introduce a sampling algorithm that keeps the dependency trees projective,
which is a very valuable constraint.
In our experiments across 30 languages, we discuss the results of various settings
of our models.
Our method outperforms the previously reported results on a
majority of the test languages.

In this paper, alternation based model of the valency lexicon of Czech verbs, VALLEX, is described.
Two types of alternations (changes in valency frames of verbs) are distinguished on the basis of used linguistic means: (i) grammaticalized alternations and (ii) lexicalized alternations.
Both grammaticalized and lexicalized alternations are either conversive, or non-conversive.
While grammaticalized alternations relate different surface syntactic structures of a single lexical unit of a verb, lexicalized alternations relate separate lexical units.
For the purpose of the representation of alternations, we divide the lexicon into data and rule components.
In the data part, each lexical unit is characterized by a single valency frame and by applicable alternations.
In the rule part, two types of rules are contained: (i) syntactic rules describing grammaticalized alternations and (ii) general rules determining changes in the linking of situational participants with valency complementations typical of lexicalized alternations.
This chapter presents current knowledge about statistical dialogue systems based on POMDP model of interaction with human users.
The chapter introduces basic concepts of POMDP and suggest appropriate methods for implementation it the context of dialogue systems.
The focus of much of dependency parsing is on creating new modeling techniques and examining new feature sets for existing dependency models.
Often these new models are lucky to achieve equivalent results with the current state of
the art results and often perform worse.
These approaches are for languages that are often resource-rich and have ample training data available for dependency parsing.
For this reason, the accuracy scores are often quite high.
This, by its very nature, makes it quite difficult to create a significantly large increase in the current state-of-the-art.
Research in this area is often concerned with small accuracy changes or very specific localized changes, such as increasing accuracy of a particular linguistic construction.
With so many modeling techniques available to languages with large resources the problem exists on how to exploit the current techniques with the use of combination, or ensemble, techniques along with this plethora of data.
Dependency parsers are almost ubiquitously evaluated on their accuracy scores, these scores say nothing of the complexity and usefulness of the resulting structures.
The structures may have more complexity due to the depth of their co-
ordination or noun phrases.
As dependency parses are basic structures in which other systems are built upon, it would seem more reasonable to judge these parsers down the NLP pipeline.
The types of parsing errors that cause significant
problems in other NLP applications is currently an unknown.
Segmentation into topically coherent segments is one of the crucial points in information retrieval (IR).
Suitable segmentation may improve the results of IR system and help users to find relevant passages faster.
Segmentation is especially important in audiovisual recordings, in which the navigation is difficult.
We present several methods used for topic segmentation, based on textual, audio and visual information.
The proposition of our approach to topic segmentation based on the fusion of audio and visual data is presented in the article.
English-Slovak parallel corpus consisting of several freely available corpora.

The amount of training data in statistical machine translation is critical for translation quality.
In this paper, we demonstrate how to increase translation quality for one language pair by bringing in parallel data from a closely related language.
In particular, we improve en→sk translation using a large Czech–English
parallel corpus and a shallow (rule-based) MT system for cs→sk.
Several setup options are explored in order to identify the best possible configuration.
WMT 2011 Workshop testing set manually translated from Czech and English into Slovak.
This paper describes the creation process of an Indonesian-English parallel corpus (IDENTIC).
The corpus contains 45,000 sentences collected from different sources in different genres.
Several manual text preprocessing tasks, such as alignment and spelling correction, are applied to the corpus to assure its quality.
We also apply language specific text processing such as tokenization on both sides and clitic normalization on the Indonesian side.
The corpus is available in two different formats: ‘plain’, stored in text format and ‘morphologically enriched’, stored in CoNLL format.
Some parts of the corpus are publicly available at the IDENTIC homepage.
Data from three sources (part of Acquis, WMT test set and sentences selected from the set of books) translated by 5 machine translation systems (Česílko, Česílko 2, Google Translate and Moses with different settings) from Czech to Slovak and evaluated by three annotators.
The translations were manually ordered according to their quality.
We introduce a taxonomy of factored phrase based
translation scenarios and conduct a
range of experiments in this taxonomy.
We

A tutorial on conducting a very broad range of experiments (for MT in particular).
Corpus annotation plays an important role in linguistic analysis and computa-tional processing of both written and spoken language.
Syntactic annotation of spoken texts becomes clearly a topic of considerable interest nowadays, driven by the desire to improve auto-matic speech recognition systems by incorporating syntax in the language models, or to build language under-standing applications.
I would like to present my recent efforts on converting the Copenhagen Dependency Treebank (CDT) data into Treex.
CDT is a multilingual treebank developed at CBS.
Treex is a multi-purpose Natural Language Processing software framework developed at Charles University in Prague.
Treex is used in a number of projects aimed at building language data resources as well as at developing NLP applications such as Machine Translation systems.
The talk will have two parts.
In the first part I will give an overview of the conversion procedure, with focus on pecularities of CDT that made the conversion a challenging task.
In the second part I will show how the CDT data in the new format can be browsed and further processed.

Linguistic issues that had to be analyzed and resolved during the annotation of information structure in the Prague Dependency Treebank.
This software is a modification and configuration of Dspace 1.6 that allows Clarin centres that employ Dspace as their repository software to use Clarin recommended Handle Service from EPIC Consortium within Dspace.
In our contribution, we relate the development of a richly annotated corpus and a computational valency dictionary.
Our valency dictionary has been created as a “byproduct” of the annotation of the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) but it became an important resource for further linguistic research as well as for computational processing of the Czech language.

Observations from this year's experiments at ÚFAL for the WMT shared translation task.
This paper contains an attempt to formalize the degree of word order freedom for natural languages.
It exploits the mechanism of the analysis by reduction and defines a measure based on a number of shifts performed in the course of the analysis.
This measure helps to understand the difference between the word order complexity (how difficult it is to parse sentences with more complex word order) and word order freedom in Czech (to which extent it is possible to change
the word order without causing a change of individual word forms, their morphological characteristics and/or their surface dependency relations).
We exemplify this distinction on a pilot study on Czech sentences with clitics.
This chapter describes the history of experiments in the field of machine translation among related Slavic languages, methods used and results achieved.
We present the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.5, the newest version of  PDT and the first to be released under a free license.
We show the benefits of PDT 2.5 in comparison to other state-of-the-art treebanks.
We present the new features of the 2.5 release, how they were obtained and how reliably  they are annotated.
We also show how they can be used in queries and how they are visualised with tools released alongside the treebank.
The paper focuses on the annotation of sentence modality in the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT).
Sentence modality is expressed by a combination of several means in Czech, from which the category of verbal mood and the final punctuation of the sentence are the most important ones.
In PDT 2.0, sentence modality was assigned semi-automatically to the root node of each sentence (tree) and further to the roots of parenthesis and direct speech subtrees.
As this approach was too simple to adequately represent the linguistic phenomenon in question, the method for assigning the sentence modality has been revised and elaborated for the forthcoming version of the treebank (PDT 3.0).
Reinforcement learning methods have been successfully used
to optimise dialogue strategies in statistical dialogue systems.
Typically, reinforcement techniques learn on-policy i.e., the
dialogue strategy is updated online while the system is interacting
with a user.
An alternative to this approach is off-policy
reinforcement learning, which estimates an optimal dialogue
strategy offline from a fixed corpus of previously collected
dialogues.
This paper proposes a novel off-policy reinforcement
learning method based on natural policy gradients and importance
sampling.
The algorithm is evaluated on a spoken
dialogue system in the tourist information domain.
The experiments
indicate that the proposed method learns a dialogue
strategy, which significantly outperforms the baseline handcrafted
dialogue policy
In this paper, we present two dependency
parser training methods appropriate for parsing outputs of statistical machine translation (SMT), which pose problems to standard
parsers due to their frequent ungrammaticality.
We adapt the MST parser by exploiting
additional features from the source language,
and by introducing artificial grammatical errors in the parser training data, so that the
training sentences resemble SMT output.
We evaluate the modified parser on DEPFIX, a system that improves English-Czech
SMT outputs using automatic rule-based corrections of grammatical mistakes which requires parsed SMT output sentences as its input.
Both parser modifications led to improvements in BLEU score; their combination was evaluated manually, showing a statistically significant improvement of the translation quality.
Much of the attention in the MT community has recently been devoted to improving the lexical choice in the target language by capturing a context wider than just a single sentence.
In this talk I will present our contribution to these efforts, particularly the progress in enriching translation models for English to Czech translation within the TectoMT system.
First of all, we performed a pure technical step.
We replaced the MaxEnt learning module used so far with the Vowpal Wabbit learning toolkit.
It
not only allows us to train our models faster, to exploit more training examples and features, but it also offers rich parametrization options, which can together lead to improvement of our MT system.
However, the main objective of this ongoing work is to explore the potential of lexical context features to improve the translation.
We do so by including the standard bag-of-words features and by introducing novel features representing concepts coming from Explicit Semantic
Analysis, which was originally developed in the field of Information Retrieval.
In this talk I presented the shift of my research from utilization of coreference to utilization of text context in general in the task of Machine Translation.
I introduced lexical discriminative translation models and the initial experiments with them integrated within the English to Czech translation scenario in TectoMT system.
Annotated corpora such as treebanks are important for the development of parsers, language applications as well as understanding of the
language itself.
Only very few languages possess these scarce resources.
In this paper, we describe our efforts in syntactically annotating
a small corpora (600 sentences) of Tamil language.
Our annotation is similar to Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) and consists of
annotation at 2 levels or layers: (i) morphological layer (m-layer) and (ii) analytical layer (a-layer).
For both the layers, we introduce
annotation schemes i.e.
positional tagging for m-layer and dependency relations for a-layers.
Finally, we discuss some of the issues in
treebank development for Tamil.
Morph length is one of the indicative feature
that helps learning the morphology of languages,
in particular agglutinative languages.
