Under a Threat of Extinction: Three cheetah cubs were born in Iran
The world's fastest animal is falling prey to ruthless hunting, traps, and deadly road accidents throughout the Islamic Republic.
As a result, the population of the cheetahs has dropped to less than 20.
Three Asiatic cheetah cubs recently appeared into the world in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, offering only a slight improvement to the tragic situation of the endangered animal in the country due to droughts, hunting, and fatal road accidents.
This marks the first captive-born cheetah birth in Iran.
It's worth noting that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still exist in the wild.
Iran's news agency 'IRNA' reported that the veterinary team, trusted by the Toran National Park in the northern Semnan province, has opted for a captive cesarean birth.
Furthermore, it was noted that fewer than 20 cheetahs have been documented in seven different provinces across the country in recent times.
In response to the threat of their extinction, the United Nations implemented a protection program for them as early as 2001.
Now, in Iran, there is hope that these new cubs could potentially contribute to the growth of the cheetah population in the future.
Last January, Iran's Deputy Minister of Environment, Hassan Akhbari, revealed that the cheetah population in the country has dramatically declined. In 2010, there were around 100 falcons, whereas now there are only 12 left.
“Their situation is extremely dire," stated Akhbari, emphasizing that the cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their native habitats, as well as to road accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest creature in the world, capable of reaching speeds of approximately 100 kilometers per hour.
Cheetahs can be found in various locations across the globe, spanning from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your vehicle: We've reviewed the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify has begun to try its luck in the hardware world as well
After years of development, Car Thing has been unveiled and launched as a small-scale trial in the United States
We've got our hands on the first device in Israel
The Vision: Transforming Your Old Cars into Smart Vehicles
Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, uniquely designed to offer a solution for owners of older vehicles.
A few weeks ago, I had the initial opportunity to try out the new product, which is currently available only to select testers in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was quite uncanny, as our family car broke down, and we had to drive a loaned vehicle with an outdated system for a few days.
After two weeks of enjoyment, I realized how the Car Thing can seamlessly become an integral part of many people's systems.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding global launch, I believe many will opt for alternative solutions.
From Concept to Reality
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began receiving an intriguing offer in their email inbox - a chance to purchase a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, transforming any older system into a smart car.
The rumors gradually faded until a year later when the Financial Times revealed that the company was soon to unveil a new product for cars, simulating a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors resurfaced after the music service updated with a car mode - the same one we recognize today from the app -activated once the smartphone detects a connection to the vehicle system.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify finally unveiled 'Car Thing' in April, its smart in-car system.
Spotify opted to release the new device in an extremely limited manner, with a long waiting list and significant delays in terms of shipments.
So, naturally, right after the press conference, I went to the website and signed up.
Two months later, the anticipated message arrived.
A renewed website login will grant me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise - it won't cost me a thing.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box adorned with the Spotify logo.
The Car Thing.
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me greatly with its build quality.
It's slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a large, bright, and crisp touchscreen on its front.
Additionally, right next to the screen, you'll find a circular knob that you can rotate to navigate between interface screens.
And despite the sizable knob, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively sleek profile without protruding excessively from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer if the company allowed the option to customize the knob's function so that I could control the smartphone's volume, as I can navigate using the touchscreen as well.
Perhaps this will be possible in a future version update.
The device comes in a small and minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type-C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you probably remember how we used to unplug our radio devices and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.
Without a doubt, the Car Thing brings back that feeling with its construction.
All the adapters connected to the device body through a very strong magnet, preventing it from falling even during off-road drives.
In addition, along its top edge, you can find small buttons that can be easily configured to control different playlists or podcasts.
By pressing and holding one of the buttons during playback or by requesting through the voice assistant, I set up several playlists that I listen to frequently, as well as my morning radio show that I tune into during my commutes.
In this way, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio rather than an extension of my smartphone.
From an Old Car to a Smart Car
After a fairly straightforward physical installation, I connected the Car Thing to the power source.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later, I arrived at the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote control, allowing it to copy all the account information from it.
Meaning, you'll still need to connect your smartphone to the car, whether via Bluetooth or through an AUX cable, in order to listen to the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, as it places emphasis on album artwork and playlists, just like the smartphone application.
Additionally, on the home screen, much like in the app, you can find music recommendations based on your taste, the search screen, and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between different screens using the touchscreen or manually through the physical knob.
Furthermore, at any given moment, you can summon the device's voice assistant by saying 'Hi Spotify'.
Through it, you can play songs, playlists, albums, and even search for podcasts.
From my experience, she easily recognized my voice even when music was playing in the background and the air conditioning was blowing directly on the device.
This is most likely due to the four microphones installed on its top part.
It's important to note that currently, the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the publication of the article, there's no information about when such an update will be available.
So, is it worth waiting for?
My experience with the device has been great, and it's a positive surprise for me, considering that it's still in the initial release phase.
Even with intensive use during long trips, the device continued to function smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
However, occasionally there was a minor glitch in the interface, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.
It's evident that the Swedish company has put a lot of effort into it in recent years, and among the various leaked versions on the internet during this period, the final product design is probably the one I like the most.
Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered who exactly the company is targeting with it.
After all, its activity is mainly limited to controlling the app on the smartphone, and not much beyond that.
What's different from buying a cheap car mount and attaching it so that the smartphone is closer to us while driving?
The question becomes more relevant when considering that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's device, and most of the time will provide the users with much more functionality.
But despite the above, as I used the Car Thing more and more, I realized how it can enhance the driving experience.
Absolutely, the ability to have Waze displayed on my smartphone screen and control the music on a separate screen has become something I've come to appreciate in the past couple of weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even release the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company is not revealing much at the moment.
The company has not shared much information about the number of testers using the device worldwide or their specific plans for the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for certain is the expected price, which is $79 (approximately 255 shekels).
For now, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse into the concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel has stated that there is currently no information available about plans for launching the device in the country.

Did you recruit talent for the company?
That's how you'll prevent competitors from "snatching" him/her from you.
The job market is still primarily controlled by the workers, and this is true twice as much when it comes to the most sought-after employees - the talents.
Here are a few tips that will help you retain talent in the workplace:
.
Despite the recent increase, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to remain one of the lowest in the world. Among the top ten countries in the OECD, the unemployment rate stands at 3.5% ( equivalent to 150,600 unemployed individuals, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics).
Meaning, the job market is still primarily controlled by the workers, and this is true twice as much when it comes to the most sought-after employees - the talents.
Regarding those professionals and managers who are hubs of knowledge, experience, and proven ability - labor market trends show that competition for them, the so-called "talents" as labeled by employers, still exists to its full extent.
The implication for employers is that in the current labor market situation, they can not afford to rest on their laurels even a moment after recruiting a sought-after talent. Once such a talent enters the company's doors, another company will already be trying to poach them away.
Exactly, the competition for talent is so intense that even after recruiting, many individuals will continue to receive tempting job offers. In fact, around 30% of employees leave within the first month of receiving a job and starting work.
Indeed, that's why savvy employers will transition from the talent acquisition phase to the talent retention phase quite seamlessly. It all begins with proper planning and creativity even during the onboarding process.
An efficient, well-structured onboarding process will cause the talent to becomes excited about their new role from day one and can even envision a future with the company.
Here are a few tips on how to prepare for and manage an effective onboarding process that will help preserve the new talent:
It's not a secret - organization's sharing and readiness.
Engage the stakeholders who will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is crucial and important to the company and the role, and describe how you envision his contribution.
A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and his value is understood will feel welcome and will aspire to meet the expectations placed upon him.
Knowledge is power - aligning expectations.
Already on the first day, arrange a conversation to align expectations with the talent.
Get to know his professional background and explore where he envisions himself in the future, so you can present to him the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can offer him in order to reach that point.
We are all people - personal acquaintance.
During the onboarding days, try to get to know the talent beyond their professional attributes and take an interest in their hobbies and areas of interest.
A new employee who feels that they are interested in him at his place of work and is allowed to express themselves beyond the boundaries of their role will appreciate this and will want to maintain it.
Curiosity promotes advancement.
Already during the onboarding stage, you can create attractiveness that will make the talent eager to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily through discussions about bonuses and perks, but by exposing the talent to an exciting field or interesting technology, as such stimuli for creativity lead to curiosity and a growing interest in the workplace.
Furthermore, encourage the talent to voice their thoughts and opinions on various projects within the company, and make it clear to them that these contributions are valuable to the organization.

Electricity and Economy: The cost of not closing the coal-fired power stations in June - one billion shekels.
Report from the Research and Information Center of the Knesset: The failure to close the coal-fired power stations by the scheduled date in June 2022 is estimated at around one billion shekels.
• Electricity Company: "The policy regarding fuel usage is primarily formulated by the Ministry of Energy.
.
The economic cost due to the failure to close the coal-fired power stations by the scheduled date in June 2022 is estimated at around one billion shekels for the year 2022, as revealed by a report from the Research and Information Center of the Knesset.
According to the report, this cost is reflected in the electricity tariff for the consumer, which is expected to rise in the coming months due to the increase in coal prices.
In addition, in 2023, an additional surplus of about 900,000 tons of coal usage is expected. This will result in further costs for the electricity sector due to the failure to close the coal-fired power stations, assuming that the natural gas price remains significantly lower than the coal price.
The report states that the implication of reducing one billion shekels from the electricity tariff in 2022 resulted in a decrease of approximately 4% in the electricity consumption tariff for household consumers.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the power stations is about one billion shekels, and the potential reduction that could have been for household consumers is around 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the reform in the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary company of the electricity company. This subsidiary will establish natural gas-operated units intended to replace the coal-fired units 1-4 at the Orot Rabin site.
Following this decision, a government resolution was adopted in July 2018, stipulating the cessation of operation of the coal-fired generation units 1-4 at the Orot Rabin power station.
The decision included timelines, so that the establishment of the first natural gas unit was set to begin in January 2020 and its operation was scheduled to commence in June 2022. Accordingly, the coal-fired generation units 1-4 will also cease operating at this time.
In response, the Electricity Company stated: 'The policy regarding fuel usage is primarily formulated by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the ministry's decisions, Israel has been implementing a policy of minimizing coal usage for several years, even when the coal price is lower than the gas price.
Paying the price. Everything you need to know before the interest rate increase.
Decrees without bounds Next week, the interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent.
By how much will the mortgage payment increase?
And what is recommended to do?
All the answers.
The intensifying inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of over 4% in the past year, will compel the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts' estimates suggest an increase rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.
If indeed the interest rate increases by half a percent, it will stand at 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
This comes after years during which the interest rate in the economy was close to zero.
The sharp increase in the interest rate significantly raises the mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and places a heavy burden on household budgets.
With the help of Shai Tzror, a mortgage expert, we examined how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.
If the interest rate increases by half a percent, how much will the monthly mortgage payment increase?
In a mortgage of 1.2 million shekels, consisting of 40% prime interest track, the monthly repayment will increase by 125 shekels.
How much did the average mortgage increase since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, there has been a significantly sharper increase.
This is because the interest rates in most of the tracks that make up the mortgage (not just the prime track) have also risen – in the linked-to-index track and in the fixed-interest track.
If the interest rate does indeed increase by half a percent, the total increase, according to Tzror's estimate, will amount to approximately 620 shekels in a mortgage of around 1.2 million shekels.
The prime track (40% in this track) will experience an increase of around 280 shekels, assuming there is an additional 0.5% increase next month.
The variable interest linked-to-index track (26.7% in this track) will experience an increase of around 120 shekels.
The fixed-interest track - non-linked (33.3% in this track) will increase by around 220 shekels.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have a mortgage mostly linked to an index, Tzror recommends considering switching to non-linked tracks.
For mortgage holders whose monthly payments have significantly increased and find it difficult to manage the repayments, he recommends considering refinancing the mortgage and extending it over a longer period.
This is in order to reduce the payments despite the increase in interest rates, as it's always better to maintain repayments and avoid defaulting.
Regarding new mortgage takers, he strongly recommends getting to know the different tracks and tailoring the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
This way, in the future when interest rates decrease, they will be able to refinance their mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.
For buyers of homes from contractors, Tzror recommends prepaying installments to the contractor and taking out a mortgage now.
It's worth considering that the 'Construction Cost Index' significantly raises the property price even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The Construction Cost Index for residential properties has increased by 6.6% in the past year.
Against the backdrop of the increase in this index, yesterday the banking supervision announced that it is considering imposing a requirement to include the linkage within mortgages. However, the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of fuel is rising, and Israelis will have to pay over 8 shekels per liter in July.
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08 shekels.
Simultaneously, the reduction of 50 agorot per liter in the tax on diesel will be extended until the end of 2022.
Decade record. The price of gasoline will jump by 36 agorot per liter - and starting from July 1st, it will be over 8 shekels per liter.
The new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08 shekels, and those who wish to enjoy full service will need to pay an additional 21 agorot per liter.
Simultaneously, the reduction of 50 agorot per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022, as stated by the Tax Authority.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continued rise in oil prices, driven by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the increase in the value of the dollar.
Without the half-shekel discount subsidized by the government since April, the price of fuel would have exceeded an all-time high of 8.25 shekels per liter.
The discount's validity ends at the end of July, and the Tax Authority and the Treasury are currently promoting a public notice about an order extending the reduction in gasoline tax, which is half a shekel per liter, until August 9th.
Additionally, starting from August 10th, an additional reduction of half a shekel will be implemented, so only from that point on, the price of a liter of gasoline will decrease by one shekel, until November 15th, 2022.
As stated by the Tax Authority.
“We have reached a point where I can't remember five consecutive months of surplus in the government's income.
We started a few months ago with the topic of reducing the tax on gasoline.
We've been working for a week on extending the additional four months the excise, gasoline, and diesel tax - instead of half a shekel per shekel.
It's good for the industry and for the citizens.
If we lower it, it will impact inflation, reduce production costs, and alleviate the cost of living.
As the Finance Minister, despite the election system, I intend to focus primarily on this," said Minister Lieberman at the Herzliya Conference on Economy and Society of the Israel Democracy Institute.
As of today, over half of the fuel price consists of government taxes (excise tax and VAT) - and this is a high taxation rate compared to most developed countries.
The fuel price has a significant impact on the cost of living in the economy, as it affects household expenses and business expenditures, public transportation and flight prices, transportation costs, and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the most business-friendly city
Petah Tikva has reached second place in the Ministry of Economy's business performance ranking.
After them: Rehovot, Ashkelon, and Rishon LeZion.
Minister Barbibai: "The pandemic highlighted the importance of local governance in business development."
.
Ashdod is the most business-friendly city for small and medium-sized businesses.
This is for the third consecutive year - according to the Local Authorities Business Environment Index conducted by the Small and Medium Business Agency in the Ministry of Economy and Industry - that local authorities have been ranked.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva, and in third place is Rehovot.
After them are located, in order: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Be'er Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya, and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the index of local authorities.
This is the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in various parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in areas where it operates.
The index is based on several parameters that are examined in each local authority, which assess the level of "business-friendliness" of the authority to businesses within its jurisdiction.
The index divides the local authorities into three size categories based on the number of residents, as a local authority with up to 50,000 residents is not comparable to a local authority with more than 150,000 residents.
Tel Aviv-Jaffa jumped in the index this year.
The index is updated once a year and assigns four different ratings to each local authority: Satisfaction of businesses, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information, and municipal taxes.
From the ranking, it can be inferred that Ramat Gan dropped from second place to eighth, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to 12th, and Netanya dropped from fifth place to 13th.
A decrease in ranking does not necessarily indicate a decline in the local authority's services to businesses, and in many cases it might be due to the fact that other local authorities have improved their services to businesses more significantly and have therefore risen in the ranking, while the local authority that dropped in ranking might not have improved its services to businesses to the same extent.
Among the risers in the ranking, we can find Petah Tikva, which climbed from the sixth place to the second, and Rehovot which moved up from the twelfth place to the third.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from the fourth place to the eleventh in 2019, improved in 2021 and climbed to the sixth place.
"Businesses - The Engine of Growth"
The ranking indicates that Nof Hagalil leads among local authorities with populations ranging between 50,000 to 150,000 residents.
Following that, the ranking places Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Carmiel, Afula, and Hod HaSharon.
In the 28th and last place, Tiberias is located.
"The index is intended to encourage local authorities to ease the burden on small and medium businesses, starting from the opening of the business and throughout its activity with the authorities," says Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Barbibai.
"Businesses constitute a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy, responsible for about 50% of the economic output and around 60% of the workforce in the economy,
The development of small businesses is a public interest for all of us, but local authorities have a direct impact on the businesses within their jurisdiction.
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of local governance, and we have seen that authorities that actively promoted and encouraged the development of small businesses and found creative solutions for them became the first point of contact for them.”
Ran Kiviti, Director of the Small and Medium Business Authority at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and essential role in the ability of businesses in their areas to thrive and prosper.
In the past two years, during which we have been dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, local authorities have had an even greater role in assisting businesses to survive in their respective fields and to survive in general."
2021 in the mail: 20 packages per household - and a jump in their weight.
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020.
The average weight per package is 435 grams - a 36% increase compared to 2020.
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight stood at 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail packages arrived in Israel, nearly 20 packages on average per household - this is according to Israel Post data obtained by Israel Hayom.
The quantity of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to that of 2020, where 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and is lower than in 2019, when 61.6 million packages were received.
However, this year there has been an increase of over 36% in the weight of the packages arriving from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, marking a 36% increase compared to 14,860 tons in 2020 and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per package jumped by 60% over the two years, from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The increase in the weight of packages is mainly influenced by two central trends, both from the seller's side and the buyer's side: Large overseas shopping websites are consolidating items for a single shipment and no longer send each product from the "shopping cart" separately in separate packaging.
From the perspective of the Israeli consumer, the quick delivery of shipments within just a few days from the moment of ordering supports the purchase of more daily-use products like clothing and gifts, of which consumers prefer to receive shortly after making the purchase.
In 2021, just like in 2020 and 2019, the month with the highest volume of incoming international packages and the highest number of items is December, with a total of 4.2 million packages arrived, weighing a combined 2,200 tons.
In the month of December, the average weight per package stood at 524 grams, which is 20% higher than the annual average weight.
The "Black Friday Effect"
More packages arrived in December than in any other month, likely due to the shopping holidays in November, such as Singles' Day in China, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.
Large orders start arriving in Israel between one to two weeks after the purchase.
Research: Most employees in the economy are not aware that they can receive tax refunds.
Many employees are entitled to receive money from the government, which could amount to tens of thousands of shekels.
Did you change your workplace?
Did you go on unpaid vacation?
Did you move from the city to a rural settlement?
You may be entitled to receive a significant amount through a simple process.
All the details - inside
Most employees are not aware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can accumulate to significant amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds totaling 3.6 billion shekels, which means that it's also worth checking if you are eligible to receive tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a substantial amount, as four out of five renters are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, however, only tens of thousands of employees actually file for tax refunds each year.
If you think that these funds would naturally go unnoticed, think again: Employees can submit a request to the Income Tax Authority for refunds for up to six years back.
The company Tax:On conducted an in-depth study among 4,000 of its customers regarding tax refunds during the year 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so this sample reflects their distribution in terms of population groups and in terms of gender, ages, and geography:
The data indicates that during the course of 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis and the layoff of hundreds of thousands of employees, significant changes occurred, with a central focus on a 15% increase in the average annual refund amount for the household, which stood at a sum of 4,300 shekels.
The reason is that unpaid vacation days compensation is lower than regular salaries, creating a gap between what the employee paid as taxes and what they actually need.
By the way, the highest refund received by a customer of the company in 2020 amounted to 121,054 shekels for returns over the past six years.
What can I get tax refunds for?
One of the reasons for receiving tax refunds is a change in the workplace.
81% of people who changed workplaces during the year generated a tax refund in an average amount of 2,943 shekels.
Another reason is maternity leave.
From the data, it can be inferred that 74% of women who gave birth and took maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to a tax refund with an average amount of 3,538 shekels for that year.
Another reason for the refund is donations.
100% of people who donate and pay taxes received a refund.
Another factor for the refund is failure to register credit points for expenses. 63%
of divorced individuals did not update their alimony credit points, resulting in a tax refund of 2,616 shekels for each year in which such credit points were not updated.
Due to unemployment - deduction for unpaid vacation: 93% of individuals who went on unpaid leave or were not unemployed and earned over 12,000 shekels received a tax refund of 4,021 shekels for the same year.
Additional reasons for tax refunds include: Refund for life insurance payments, mortgage life insurance, refund for a qualifying settlement, refund for losses in securities, failure to register credit points for a male related to childbirth and distribution of tax refunds based on geographic location.
- 94% of individuals who deposited into personal life insurance or took out a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In an analysis conducted, on every one million shekels of mortgage over 25 years, the accumulated tax refund for the period amounts to over 20,000 shekels for the overall mortgage period.
100% of those who moved to a qualifying settlement received a tax refund for the transition year, because approval for residency in a qualifying settlement is granted only after 12 months from the day the resident's status is changed to a resident of that settlement, and in a result, in practice, the first year is subject to full tax payment.
79% of customers who hold securities were eligible for tax refunds in the mentioned years.
However, individuals who hold securities should still check every year, as losses are not automatically carried over from year to year; they need to be reported through the submission of a report.
56% of men who have a newborn child do not register credit points for the birth year in their salary deduction.
The refund amount can reach tens of thousands of shekels over the course of six years.
This phenomenon is mainly present in the Arab sector.
Tax:on CEO, Tal Karmon: 'The COVID-19 crisis has led to a much more active engagement of the salaried public in Israel.
It is interested, checks, and demands what he is entitled to in income tax refunds.
It becomes clear that staying at home, being on unpaid leave, or after being laid off, for many hundreds of thousands of Israelis for several months, has prompted many renters to thoroughly examine what they are entitled to from the government.
It's important to know that nowadays, all the procedures for obtaining tax refunds can be done digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past."
The Job Market: Fewer candidates for a position, higher salary.
AllJobs report for 2021 summary: At the forefront of demand - positions without experience •
The volume of offered positions increased by 50% •
Seeking employment, but not storming the market.
In the just-concluded year, there has been a 15% decrease in the number of submitted resumes, and for each position, an average of only 23 candidates competed, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year - according to a report by the AllJobs website summarizing the year 2021, on the COVID-19 crisis and its impacts on the job market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were primarily interested in saturated job sectors such as administration and sales, to which a total of 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
Nevertheless, entry-level positions led the demand with over 38,000 searches - likely due to a resurgence of inexperienced young individuals seeking immediate employment after completing their unpaid leave payments..
The number of searches for sales and administration positions was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), for drivers and couriers there were 11,000 searches, and for security positions there were slightly less than 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the COVID-19 crisis, the salary in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average salary in Israel stood at 11,675 shekels gross.
The monthly salary in the software field averaged 17,915 shekels, and in information systems analysis, it stood at 17,140 shekels.

Men earned 13,295 shekels, compared to women's salary of 9,740 shekels.
Trying to return to normalcy.
On the business side, there was a broad growth recorded in almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses were eager to have more and more employees..
As a result, the job supply increased by 50% and reached a record high of over 40,000 positions on AllJobs.
A survey conducted by the website among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, with 30% indicating their intention to increase their hiring, but 72% acknowledged that they would face challenges in doing so this year.
The largest supply was for positions without experience - there were over 58,000 such positions on the website.
Following those were customer service and administration roles, each with around 44,000 positions, sales and software with 41,000 positions each, education and teaching with 24,000 vacancies, and warehouse roles still in demand with 19,000 vacant positions.
Einav Boimfeld, Director of Research and Content at AllJobs, said: 'Job seekers are trying to return to normalcy but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive positions in their eyes.
As well, the prolonged disconnection from the job market makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living”.

"Not taken for granted:" ‘Sabliminal’ is observing the Sabbath - and preparing for independence day.
Celebrating the fact that 'we can live as we just want to,' excited for the upcoming meeting with the audience, and making sure to spend time with the children.
The weekend and Independence Day of Kobi Shimoni, ‘Subliminal’.
What does a typical Friday look like for you?
“The weekends are the most significant moments in life, for me.
The Kiddush and tradition are deeply rooted in my soul.
My Fridays are dedicated to the children, Or (10) and Yonatan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and supplies for the Kiddush, have lunch together, and do something fun as a family, like playing soccer, riding horses, or playing with remote control cars.
Sometimes we go to the beach, or just wash the car, but we always stop by the way to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store - and there's always another excuse.
When we return home with all the gifts, the aromas of cooking welcome us”.
How does your Friday meal look?
"I am blessed the candles around me.
On my side, there's a Persian-Tunisian kitchen, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, singing, and joy.
On my wife's Iness side, who is also a wonderful cook, Ukrainian dishes come in, which are rich and spicy, with lots of meat.
When we arrive at my mother-in-law's, even from the building lobby, amazing aromas waft out from her apartment.
Usually, I do the Kiddush, together with the kids, who know it by heart.
In the end, my fun after the meal is to lie down on the rug, and the kids jump on me as if I'm some kind of inflatable toy.
Do you have a special childhood memory from Friday evenings?
As a child, I would wake up on Saturdays to the sounds of Israeli music on Reshet Gimmel radio and the skits of Hagashash Ha-hiver, which we all knew about."
My dad loved nature, and we traveled a lot around Israel, mostly to the north.
Every corner in the country held a special place in his heart.
He passed away three months ago after a severe illness, and for him, the Kiddush and Shabbat was the holiest of holies, especially in terms of bringing the whole family together.
Recently, I released a song in his memory called 'Watching Over You,' which I created together with Osher Cohen.
I believe he would have been proud of this creation that sanctifies the bond between a father and a son”.
Soon we will celebrate the 74th Independence Day. As an enthusiastic Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a sacred day for me, and it's part of the meaning and identity I hold.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents were forced to hide their Jewish identity, whereas I am an Israeli Jew who is fortunate to live with my children in our own country.
Two weeks before Independence Day, I would already be climbing trees and attaching strings with Israeli flags to my house.
These days, my Independence Day is filled with performances, and I always meet an ecstatic crowd celebrating the fact that we can live the way we want.
We need to ensure that our children, grandchildren, and future generations will also have this opportunity, and to remember that nothing here is taken for granted.
Her Friday: Esti Zackheim is blessing the Sabbath.
"My dream is to set up a big table and invite all my dear departed loved ones”: Esti Zackheim dreams of a Friday night meal and how she copes with the fact that her husband observes the Sabbath?
Tell us about your preparations for the Sabbath.
.
The preparations start already on Thursday night when I return from a show or workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires a long cooking process, like goulash, roasts, and sauces.
On Friday, in the first part of the day, I dedicate time to myself, meet with friends for coffee, attend a show or a movie, or participate in rehearsals.
During the summer, the Sabbaths come in later, and I have plenty of time to relax in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or simply enjoy a good TV series.
For the Sabbath meal, I usually host my mom, Varda, who is celebrating her 89th birthday, and also friends”.
Can I share more about the cooking?
"I love shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling and chopping 10 onions and shedding tears, I buy a bag of frozen chopped onions and fry them.
On my Shabbat table, you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, oven-baked potatoes, and roasted cauliflower.
I prepare most of the dishes, and they of course get warmed up on the hot plate on Shabbat.
Alejandro, my partner, prepares chicken soup, vegetable salad, and in the winter - the Cholent”.
Your husband is religious and you come from a secular background.
How does it work?
Living with someone who observes the Sabbath is an endless compromise.
'Love your neighbor as yourself’ in practice.
He can't join family trips, so I often find myself packing the kids and joining friends' family outings.
In addition, I'm also the designated driver for the kids, the one who picks them up on Friday nights from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Shabbat observance, because usually I don't appear on Shabbat and get a kind of 'forced vacation' - and that's a good thing.
Who would you like to host on Shabbat?
"I would set a large table and invite 'my departed loved ones'.
Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if my late brother Daniel z”l were still alive, or if my father Shneior z”l could see my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
"We probably would have had lively discussions about soccer and politics, and enjoy each other”.
Do you have a special childhood memory from Friday evenings?
“We were a warm and united family.
On Friday afternoons, my mom would prepare a stack of schnitzels, bring hummus and pita bread from the market, and roast eggplants for tahini salad.
Afterwards, we would go to Aunt Hannah in Yad Eliyahu, or as she used to say, 'Yad Alayke’, and she would prepare blintzes.
Since I was the only one who didn't like raisins, she would prepare several portions for me without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest among the siblings, and took care of me.
On Saturdays, we used to take a tour with my father at the Jaffa Port, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, arrived in the country with nothing”.

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck got engaged.
Nearly two decades after their love story ended in a breakup, Lopez and Affleck are reuniting and getting back together.
Lopez parted ways with baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021.
.
The one and only for him: Nearly two decades after their initial love story ended in a breakup and a year after the publicized comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic circle and engaged.
The joyful news was shared yesterday evening (Friday) by Lopez with her fans on her official website, onthejlo.com
.
The news of the engagement comes after Lopez was spotted this week wearing a large diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative on her behalf confirmed to the magazine People that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
As previously mentioned, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and proposed to Lopez (52) was in 2002, and it was an eye-catching ring with a massive pink diamond of six carats, estimated to be worth around $2.5 million.
Despite the grand gestures of love, the two parted ways in 2004, blaming the media's excessive obsession and relentless scrutiny in their lives.
Since then, Affleck went on to marry actress Jennifer Garner, with whom he has three children, and on the other hand, as is well known, Lopez has been married three times before, including to singer Marc Anthony, with whom they became parents to twins.
Jennifer Lopez's most recent romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she separated in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians are speaking, "You can't make up what's happening to us"
"the chaos is never-ending", insists mom Kris Jenner about the new series starring the first family of reality, and she receives support from her daughters and the new producer •
In an article to be published in the magazine "ShiShabat," they discuss the big money, the PR machinery, the branding factory and the change Kim wants to bring to the world: "I'm not the same person who used to spend hours thinking about which bikini selfie to post"
It might surprise many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 of the content empire Disney, which includes, among other things, Marvel and "Star Wars” movies, is the Kardashian family.
The details of the contract between the first family of reality TV and social media networks with Disney have not been disclosed, but estimates suggest a minimum sum of $100 million was transferred to the family's daughters, who now also function as producers.
During a press event with the stars, each of them is accompanied by an entire beauty team that takes care of non-stop touch-ups for makeup, hair, and wardrobe adjustments, the family's daughters insisted, as did their sought-after new producer, that this time it's not about reality TV – what's being presented on the screen is completely authentic.
"It's impossible to make up what's happening to us," the family matriarch Kris Jenner insists, "the chaos is never-ending".
"We're showing how much we've grown since that series premiered in 2007," says Khloe Kardashian.
"When we started, we were overwhelmed, a lot was happening in our lives, and it's impossible to condense everything into a simple beginning, middle, and end narrative," she says.
“Many plots were rushed in editing, wrapped in a colorful glossy film, and forgotten on the sidelines.
That's not how life looks in reality.
Now we're more exposed, facing the camera directly in a natural way, not just in a reality show but in an authentic documentary series”.
When facing them with their new involvement in the production of the series, which essentially gives them complete control over the content that appears on screen, Khloe claims, "We're involved behind the scenes, we see clips during editing and provide feedback, but not from a place of dictation, just giving our input on what will make the series better.
It's a reflection of our lives, and personally, I feel that I've undergone emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were young children when we started, so they are setting boundaries more now”.
"I grew up."
Kim Kardashian, from her side, continues to work vigorously to change her image, transitioning from a trash-reality persona to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I've matured," she claims, "I'm raising four black children, which means from a persecuted community that faces adversity in this country.
I want to change the reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends will have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the broken system.
This is my motivation".
"I'm not the same Kim who used to think for hours about which bikini selfie to post," she insists, "but it hasn't completely disappeared from my life either.
A person needs to be true to who they really are and take everything with a sense of enjoyment."
About the reasons for the dismissal of the producer that revealed them, Ryan Seacrest, and about their new and highly profitable path in the industry, the significance of the transition to Disney, the family's well-oiled PR machine and its impact on the brand's profitability, and more, in the full article that will be published in the "ShiShabat" magazine.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The winner of 'The Next Star' releases a second single, returning to childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song tells about the way to maintain a long-distance relationship," he explains
Tamir Greenberg releases his second single titled "Into The Night," following his successful debut single and his participation in "The Next Star."
In recent months, Greenberg continues to perform in numerous shows: Tel Aviv Culture Hall, Tel Aviv Opera House, Amphi Shuni, Amphi Ganei Yehoshua, Hangar 11, and dozens of other shows.
The song "Into The Night" was produced and arranged by Tamir Greenberg with producer Stav Begar.
The music video, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to memories of his childhood and the significant presence of his father in his life.
“The song talks about the relationship between my father and me.
About the period when I left the country for the US and the way to maintain the connection from afar," says Greenberg.
In the coming month, Greenberg will perform at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and towards the new season of 'The Next Star’, the song with which he won the program, 'Tell Me Where The Light Goes,' was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Made in Israel: Yuval Shamla is the big winner of this season and the 16th Ninja Warrior in the world.
The phenomenon climbed Mount Midoriyama in 26 seconds and won the title of 'Israel's First Ninja Warrior'.
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but he won't hold the title of Ninj
a
We have a winner: Yuval Shamla conquered the Midoriyama and is the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel", now holds the title of the first Israeli Ninja and the 16th in the world.
Shamla has been participating in the program since its first season, where he finished in first place, and In the second season he lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season, he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, while during the filming he announced that this would be his final season.
Tonight, he climbed Mount Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, surpassing the competitors Yogev Malka and Yishai Kalfon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season only one ninja can be crowned who managed to climb the Mount Midoriyama within the time limit.
Therefore, despite Malcha's impressive achievement, since Yuval Shamla, the winner of this season, climbed Mount Midoriyama 3 seconds faster, Malcha does not receive the global title of ninja.
He will be able to compete for this title again in the next season.
OK, we got it: Shamla is a superman, Rotem Sela is perfect, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sports event in the world.
.
Two Olympic medalists and an experienced sports broadcaster set in the final of a reality show and acted as if it were the most significant sports achievement on the universe.
.
Rotem Sela represents for us such a perfect feminine ideal, that it's distorted to portray her like that on television.
She earns more from campaigns than Wonder Woman, she's too beautiful, she knows how to stand her ground against Dana Weiss, and when needed - she can also defend her business partner.
She's a mother and a career woman, endorsing banks and air conditioners, modeling and hosting TV shows and reality programs, and also serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
Perhaps it's logical that Rotem Sela has a perfect image on screen, as in the program she hosts, there's a requirement for everything to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for it.
In the world of Ninja everyone is larger than life, and it is starting with the hosts.
Asi Azar seemed to have gotten entangled in a situation where he was supposed to be removed from the screen for a certain period, but since he's not an ordinary person, he managed to extricate himself from it even before the first round of publicity.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who in his life broadcast European Cup wins and world records, is excited about the Mega-Wall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the universe.
In the final, two Olympic medalists (Yarden Gerbi and Linoy Ashram) sat beside him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the entry conditions into the human world that this reality show presents for four seasons already.
"Ninja Israel" went to great lengths to promote the season, which concluded last night with Mount Midoriyama, and Yuval Shamla managed to climb it in 26 seconds, finally being crowned as the Ninja.
Navigating an almost insurmountable path, it systematically tested and humbled each of the superhuman participants whose egos the show had carefully bolstered over the course of the year.
Interested in becoming a Ninja Warrior?
Not here.
Here, they are looking for superheroes.
The emphasis was on finding the heir to Shamla, known as the "King of Kings and the One of a Kind," along with other titles aimed at highlighting how perfect and unique he is.
As a result, the difficulty level was elevated, causing the female contestants who attempted to tackle this season's obstacles to falter, while the male competitors vied with each other to determine who possessed more abdominal muscles and the charisma of a dictator in order to step into the shoes of the retiring Shamla.
They might say that it's a sports program that promotes physical activity and showcases overcoming difficulties and challenges, but from the perspective of the vast majority of viewers – average couch potatoes like us – "Ninja Israel" cultivates an unattainable model of sporting achievement.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gil Sassover moves between punches to discussions about holiness.
It's strange to see the comedian, formerly of "Comedy Store", hosting the program "Kabbalat Shabbat" on Channel 14, where he tastes dishes and provides entertainment mainly for men.
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question "What does the concept of 'preparing for Shabbat' remind you of?".
You will say: Sponges and cleanliness, pots on the stove and scents in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi Ka'akun on TV, but the strangest thing would be if someone suddenly says "Gil Sassover".
Because Gil Sassover in the midst of sponges and cooking is the most unrelated thing that television can offer.
Indeed, "Kabbalat Shabbat," the new show he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, stands in stark contrast to the time it is being aired.
Throughout half of it, Sassover stands.
He speaks rapidly, holding a microphone in his hand even while tasting dishes, and he tries to balance the conversation between jokes and discussions about sanctity.
In his defense, it might be said that budget constraints are noticeable, and this is likely the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also evident in the premiere episode that aired yesterday from Mateh Binyamin, is a clear gender division.
The men sing, play music, dance, discuss Torah, promote restaurants and factories – while the women settled for a small item, in which they excitedly talked about managing a sewing workshop.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Kabbalat Shabbat with Gil Sassover, now 14.
The Sheltered Housing Association against Ruthie Russo: “Saying 'This has a taste of protected housing' harms our activities."
Julie Gat, the head of the association, sent a letter in which she expressed the union's complaint against what they deemed a derogatory statement made by one of the judges of "The Next Restaurant" in one of the trailers for the program.
Ruthie Russo responded: "I'm glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary needs of this population."
The Association of Nursing Homes and Sheltered Housing in Israel against "the next restaurant": In a letter sent by Chairwoman Yuli Gat and received by "Israel Hayom" it is written as follows: "In advance of the broadcast, which was circulated on all social networks and television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said 'there is a taste of sheltered housing in the food,' meaning food of a closed institution with low-quality food".
"The tone that the judge of the program, Ruthie Russo, chose to describe her disappointment with the food presented by the contestant undermines our years-long efforts to combat the existing stigma in the field, because sheltered housing facilities operate restaurants in various homes for the benefit of the residents, providing gourmet meals of the highest quality."
"Service teams and facility managers are working hard to uphold the image of sheltered housing that offers quality living solutions for the elderly, including addressing loneliness, providing abundant leisure activities, ensuring a high quality of life, and more."
In recent years in Israel, more and more families and older individuals have come to understand that loneliness is the most challenging condition in old age, viewing community centers as a proven solution to this condition.
"Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, and therefore, we dedicate resources and efforts to provide the residents with the finest cuisine.
The majority of sheltered housing facilities rely on professional chefs to create their menus.
We would be delighted to invite the judging panel at any time to experience the winning dishes that are served daily to tens of thousands of elderly individuals in Israel, and additionally, on behalf of the chefs and restaurant teams in assisted living facilities, we kindly request your apology and clarification.
Let us come together, media outlets, and Israeli society, to encourage communal living for the benefit of the health of the elderly”.
Ruthie Russo responded by saying, "I'm glad there are places that invest more in the culinary experience for this population, which certainly deserves excellent food in the advanced stages of life.
I respect the hard work of chefs, cooks, and kitchen staff everywhere, including in sheltered housing facilities”.
"Double standard: In Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't cancel?”
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer addressed the criticism directed at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
"
Nick Cave canceled a performance in Russia earlier this week due to the war and announced that he "stands by Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon."
In doing so, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands like Iggy Pop, Green Day, and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled their performances in the invading country.
But in the case of Cave, his cancellation announcement received a slightly different context.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet accused the singer of being hypocritical, as in 2017 Cave refused to cancel two concerts that took place in Israel, despite receiving significant criticism from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to the country, Cave told the local media, "In the end, I am here for two reasons: The first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."
The same Ahmet praised Cave's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even published on the uncensored personal site of the singer, "The Red Hand Files," a post in which he argued that Israel is also an occupying state, and therefore the situation in Palestine is similar to that in Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your message regarding Ukraine," wrote Ahmet, "is that you didn't show the same support for the Palestinians, who are also suffering under a brutal regime.
In fact, you portrayed Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is primarily responsible for the suffering of the Palestinians.
I'm very saddened by this because you represent a double standard here," the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story doesn't end here, as Cave chose to respond to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he emphasized that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first scenario is an unprovoked attack by one state on its neighbor, in the hope of altering the overall security order of Europe.
The second scenario is a complex clash between two nations.
The conflicts are indeed similar in that innocent people who share a tragic fate are forced to seek refuge in shelters.
I feel great sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are located or who they are”.
Cave added that although he doesn't want to elaborate on his views regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supports the Palestinians as well, mentioning that over the past 20 years, he has actively participated in events aimed at contributing to their well-being.
"But it's not a time for debates, Ahmet," the singer clarified, "it's a time to come together and support the Ukrainians, who are currently facing a catastrophe on their land.
I have wonderful fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose Putin's regime's actions.
If I could perform for them, I would do it," he stated.
In light of the decrease in infection rates: The COVID-19 projector will resume managing the Ziv Medical Center.
Professor Salman Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the COVID-19 treatment policy during the third and fourth waves.
At the request of the Minister of Health, Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue concurrently in his role as the Projector.
Professor Zarka: "I'm glad that the Omicron wave continues to recede, but we still have an obligation to be prepared for another wave."
.
Against the backdrop of the decrease in COVID-19 cases, Professor Salman Zarka, the Coronavirus projector, will return to lead the Ziv Medical Center in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of the Minister of Health, Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue concurrently in his role as the Projector.
"I am glad for the sake of the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to recede and that we are returning to our normal way of life," said Professor Zarka, adding, "Nevertheless, it is still our duty to be prepared for another wave of illness as a result of the virus still being present here in Israel and around the world."
Professor Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the COVID-19 treatment policy during the third and fourth waves.
Starting from May 1st, Israel returned to a state of "between waves," which involves reducing most of the COVID-19 arrays while maintaining the capability to perform sequence tests and investigations that will serve as a foundation for action in case a new variant is detected.
Occult infection
In a report from the National Knowledge and Information Center for the Coronavirus Response, published this morning, it was noted that "there is a decrease in the average number of new confirmed cases to below two thousand per day, on a weekly average basis, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized and severely hospitalized patients."
However, it was emphasized that "there is a significant occult morbidity, and in practice, the number of infected individuals is much higher.
The number of institutional tests conducted in the community (excluding returning travelers, m.y.) is low and stands at less than 20,000 tests on average per week.
The low volume of tests makes it difficult to identify the trends of the illness and understand the situation”.
State Comptroller's Report: The actual budget for most of the years of activity of the Basket of Medicines Committee was lower than the recommended budget.
According to the report by Matanyahu Angleman, for over 20 years of the committee's activity, the Ministry of Health did not closely monitor the committee's activities.
The report also states that the minutes of the committee meetings are published with significant delays, if at all.
Furthermore, the State Comptroller recommends increasing transparency in the activities of the subcommittee and updating the working procedures of the basket committee.
Another deficiency found is that since the committee began its activity, the Ministry of Health did not request the healthcare providers to report on the extent of drug usage and utilization from the basket, which would have allowed for analysis and control of the budget allocated to them.
The Basket of Medicines Committee is one of the most influential public committees that impact our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new medications to be provided to the public free of charge through the healthcare providers - however, a new report by the State Comptroller, published today (Tuesday), warns that the committee has been operating for over 20 years without conducting control reports on its activities, and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervising and examining its activities.
"Yisrael Hayom" journalist, Ran Raznik, adds that the investigation by the State Comptroller was carried out following the ongoing exposés in "Yisrael Hayom" regarding the failures of the Basket of Medicines Committee.
According to the report by Matanyahu Angleman, he recommends "making corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will lead to a higher quality utilization of the health services budget that the public is entitled to."
Throughout the existence of the mechanism for adding drugs to the medication basket, between the years 1998 and 2021, medications worth a total of eight billion shekels were added to the state budget, while the addition varied annually, ranging between 0 to 500 million shekels.
In the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, requests were submitted to add approximately 800 new drugs and medical technologies to the healthcare services basket, with a total annual cost of over two billion shekels.
In practice, the budget allocated for the expansion of the healthcare services basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.
During most of the committee's operation (90% of the time), the budget increase was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a percentage recommended by various committees as the desired increase.
The Comptroller notes that there is a need to examine and regulate the annual increase amount in order to enable certainty and long-term planning.
Furthermore, Angleman pointed out that “The transparency model in the work of the basket committee is lacking”.
For example, the procedure of the Basket Committee states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days. However, in practice, the minutes are published with a delay of 160 to 109 days, and sometimes the final meeting minutes are not published at all.
"The delay in publishing the minutes harms the transparency of the decisions; as a result, the ability of proposers – health organizations and pharmaceutical companies – to submit revised requests promptly and relevantly, after receiving feedback from the previous round may be compromised, so they could analyze the reasons for their proposals' rejection, improve and adjust their suggestions, and reevaluate their feasibility for acceptance in the next round," noted the State Comptroller in the report.
"The Ministry of Health should publish the minutes according to the specified timelines in the procedure".
Out of thousands of submissions, only one financial note was submitted
Additional criticism from Angleman relates to the preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The auditor found that nearly half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejections.
Another flaw concerns the activities of the subcommittee of the drug basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The Comptroller recommends including a public representative or considering the option of publicly disclosing the discussions without revealing confidential commercial details.
According to the procedure under which the Health Services Basket Committee operates, it is stipulated that an "economic assessment" should be submitted for a request to add a drug to the basket.
However, in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment was submitted out of thousands of applications – and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, during the discussions of the Basket Committee for the years 2021-2019, requests to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket were submitted.
The report indicated that requests were not accompanied by economic assessments, including estimates of potential savings from reducing obesity-related diseases or avoiding Gastric bypass surgeries.
Furthermore, the report highlights that decisions of the Drug Basket Committee are not always aligned with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
For instance, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparedness for treating chronic disease growth as goals. However, in the context of decisions regarding the expansion of the Drug Basket, there was not enough emphasis on achieving these goals.
The Comptroller also raises a concern that since 2011, services have been included in the Drug Basket that are not the responsibility of the healthcare providers, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health ("The Third Addition").
This is done when the legal framework for this step is organized only retrospectively.
In the past six years, a total of 74 million shekels from the supplementary drug basket have been used for these services.
Angleman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the working procedures of the drug basket committee and determine whether a separate financial allocation is needed for these services.
About a third of the new medications added to the drug basket are categorized as "cost-neutral drugs," meaning their usage does not result in additional expenses to the healthcare providers as they replace existing treatments.
The Comptroller suggests considering an option where these medications would follow a separate and expedited path, allowing for updates to the drug basket multiple times a year rather than just once.
There is no oversight over the use of especially expensive medications.
The criticism also highlights that since the establishment of the basket Committee, nearly 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not requested the healthcare providers to report and did not oversee the extent of the usage and utilization of medications in the basket, information which could have enabled the Ministry to analyze and control the budget allocated to the healthcare providers.
Over the years, only two reports have been published that refer to the years 2006-2009, and even these were published with a significant delay (the latest was published this year and dealt with the budget utilization in the years 2007-2009).
"The delay in conducting tests could lead to difficulties in data collection and analysis, irrelevance of conclusions drawn from the testing after such a long period, suboptimal pricing of the subcommittee, and making decisions based on non-final findings," the report states.
Additionally, the ministry does not oversee and supervise the usage of particularly expensive medications and has not generated insights.
These are 10 medications that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion shekels from 2016 to 2021).
In response to this, the auditor wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct private audits on these medications and technologies and analyze the extent of their usage compared to estimates.
Conducting audits and analyses would allow for systematic conclusions regarding the work process of the Basket Committee and the Subcommittee, as well as the method of preparing estimates during the pricing of medications and technologies, in order to improve them”.
"Appalling and incomprehensible": Heated debate in the Health Committee about the poisoning at the Dafna House.
The measurements of the first vaccinated individual who passed away were normal ten minutes before her death.
Committee Chairman, KM Silman: 'If people cared that the kitchen would be like at home, it wouldn't look like this.'"
Ten minutes before the first dependent individual, aged 40, from the 'Dafna House' residence in Holon, passed away from food poisoning, medical measurements were taken that were normal," claimed the residence's manager during today's (Tuesday) discussion in the Health Committee.
"We have overnight caregivers who check during the night, and there's a nurse making rounds.
There were several reports of diarrhea, and the same resident, in fact, the last time measurements were taken from her was 10 minutes before she stopped responding, and they were normal.
She was under observation like the rest of the residents with diarrhea.
She is under nursing care, we went to bring a lift to assist with her transfer, and then the same resident did not respond.
We began resuscitation and called the clinic nurse," described the residence manager of what happened on Sunday morning at the residence.
It is an incident in which three residents passed away, six were hospitalized, and a total of a quarter of the residence's residents (33 out of 131) suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms due to consuming contaminated goulash meat.
The residence manager made these statements against the backdrop of allegations that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of supervision on the part of the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Nuss, the head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Office, stated that 'we cannot definitively determine what caused the deaths of the three residents.
Only blood tests were taken from them."
Furthermore, it was raised in the discussion that even from the residents who were hospitalized, it was no longer possible to obtain a stool sample as they did not have diarrhea, thus it is not possible to definitively determine the cause of death and illness.
Furthermore, the engineer representing the Ministry of Health indicated that “The Ministry of Health examines the state of hygiene in kitchens at institutions once every four years, upon request from the Ministry of Welfare or upon request for license renewal."
In the Ministry of Welfare, it was acknowledged that an investigation committee has not yet been appointed for this case and for the previous case of malnutrition among residents, which occurred three months ago at the 'Bnei Zion' institution in Sharon.
The chairman of the Health Committee, KM Idit Silman, said during the discussion: 'If people cared that the kitchen would be like at home, it wouldn't look like this.
The residents in welfare residences need more.
They are health-sensitive and require extra supervision and care.
It is appalling and incomprehensible what transpired there.
The shocking findings were revealed even after they were informed that the Ministry of Health was coming to investigate.
Where is the supervision and responsibility of the ministries?
How come in such a discussion, the ministers and the directors-general of the ministries aren't present to provide an explanation about what's happening here?”
Yigal Nachatomi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who manages the residence and even ran the residence himself, said, 'Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire system rise with one goal in mind: To do good for people.
The individuals who passed away are people I personally cared for.
I personally lifted one of the residents onto my hands.
This is a deeply unsettling event for us."
Smadar Una, a former resident of an equivalent facility in Gilo, lashed out at him and said “Enough with the lies and pretty words.
I was there”.
Gali Barami, a representative of parents in EKIM Israel, said: “We complained in the past about the food and they didn't take the criticism".
Oren Helman, founder of the 'Equal Chance' initiative for integrating people with disabilities, criticized the fact that the names of the deceased residents were not published: “Their names are not known at all.
Are they worth less?
"They are disregarding the lives of our children".
Suspected negligence in Walfson: The surgeon caused a tear in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akar as the head of the Thoracic Surgery Unit at the hospital.
The chairman of the doctors' committee complained that the director, Dr. Angel, was warned before his appointment.
The hospital: “He is respected and experienced”
First publication: A horrifying mistake occurred at the government hospital, Wolfson, in Holon, as during a surgery, the doctor accidentally caused a tear in the patient's heart, leading to his tragic death.
The surgery was performed on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient on April 19th.
This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akar at the hospital after being appointed as the head of the Thoracic Surgery Unit at Wolfson.
During the surgery, intended to drain the area around the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, leading to severe bleeding and resulting in the patient's death.
However, the exceptional complication opened Pandora's box, raising challenging questions regarding the hospital's management.
The director of the Oncology Institute and chairman of the doctors' committee, Dr. Ronen Brenner, called for an investigation into the incident in a letter he sent to the hospital's director, Dr. Anat Angel.
In the letter, serious allegations were raised about the conduct of Dr. Angel and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, following the departure of the former unit head, Dr. Benny Zukerman, to Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer.
A massive hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient was sober, functional, and under his care for the past four years.
Recently, his illness worsened, and abnormal fluid accumulation was discovered within the heart sac, where the heart muscle is located.
Furthermore, the surgeon, Dr. Abu Akar, believed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, a serious complication occurred during the surgery, and Dr. Hagay Dekel, the director of the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department at Wolfson, who was performing surgery on a child in the adjacent room at the same time, was called urgently to the operating table and saw a massive hole in the heart”.
According to him, the heart was devoid of blood, the blood pressure was zero, and the surgical approach was incorrect.
In addition, Dr. Brenner also reported that Dr. Dekel approached him and said that Dr. Abu Akar is not suitable, professionally and personally, to manage the Thoracic Surgery Unit at Wolfson.
However, despite the explicit warnings and despite him being supposed to be the direct manager of the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Angel conducted a tender without involving him and appointed Dr. Abu Akar to the position.
He also noted: “This is not a complicated process, which takes a few minutes”, and added: “It is impossible to ignore the flawed process of appointing Dr. Abu Akar to the position.
The question arises whether there is direct responsibility of Angel for the surgical failure and the patient's death”.
Experienced surgeon
Before 'Israel Hayom,' information and allegations from other senior doctors were presented, reinforcing the questions raised in the incident by Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of Surgical Department A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is “one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but he is relatively young in thoracic surgery”.
He also added that Abu Akar was selected through a proper tender process and Dr. Dekel did not participate in it, in line with his statements about his intention to 'disengage' from the thoracic unit.
He also noted, “I also wasn't involved in the process, and I might have been supposed to be.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Faras Abu Akar began working on April 10th and is entitled to 100 days of grace. “All the hospital doctors were impressed by his professionalism and motivation, and his willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of similar procedures, and unfortunately, the current case ended as it did in a regrettable manner.
Wolfson Hospital responded: “We share in the family's sorrow.
This is a patient of the oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The mentioned thoracic surgeon is an esteemed and experienced professional, selected through a tender process to manage the Thoracic Surgery Unit affiliated with the Surgical Department at Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Hagay Dekel, his statements that were quoted are not accurate and were taken out of context.
It should be noted that the patient was, unfortunately, in a very critical condition.
The hospital is transparently examining the details of the case, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the case details".

Healing Model: Three senior doctors talk about their mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the insight and wisdom of Prof. Marvin Shapiro, may he rest in peace, especially during the days of the pandemic.
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh remembers, even beyond his role, the encouragement from Prof. Saul Suckenik, may he rest in peace.
Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev thanks Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld for the lesson in empathy with the patients
Three key individuals in the hospitals write about those who inspired and encouraged them to be better caregivers and better human beings.
Three senior doctors, three life and profession mentors. On the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, "Israel Hayom" invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh, and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to reflect on the figures that accompanied them at the beginning of their journey and helped them become who they are today.
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba Medical Center.
About Prof. Marvin Shapiro, may he rest in peace
The encounter that opened my eyes and changed my life.
If I hadn't met Prof. Marvin Shapiro, may he rest in peace, who was the head of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Medical Center, I would probably have remained a specialist physician in internal medicine.
He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to engage with it.
I met him at the Hadassah Medical Center corridors, around the 1980s of the previous century.
For a moment, I didn't think I would leave internal medicine, as I enjoyed patient care. However, Prof. Shapiro showed me that the field of infectious diseases manifested itself not only in neurology but also in internal medicine, and essentially in every domain.
I am grateful to him for introducing me to this field.
Throughout the journey, I admired his investigative approach that delved into the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor through and through, who loved his patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to thoroughly examine everything.
He was a genuine and honest person, devoid of ego, qualities that I greatly admired in him.
At first, when I was asked to choose a physician who would be a role model for me and influence me more than anyone else, I intended to choose my father, Dr. Yosef Rakover, may he rest in peace, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in the partisan unit.
He was an incredible doctor who influenced me to pursue medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapiro.
Both of them, for example, coined phrases that doctors still use today - for instance, "tissue is the issue", meaning that taking a biopsy of the affected organ helps determine which medications to give; or "when you use it, you lose it," explaining that excessive antibiotic use leads to bacteria becoming resistant to them.
Prof. Marvin Shapiro, may he rest in peace, was married to a physiotherapist who worked at Hadassah and was the father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family during the seven-day mourning period at his home.
He was someone - a knowledgeable and wise epidemiologist who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his difficult illness.
He was one of the first doctors in the team to treat epidemics, and he is sorely missed during this period.
If he were with us today, I'm sure I would consult with him, and I'm confident that he would be one of the leaders of the team for treating epidemics.

Dr. Shlomi Kodesh, Director of Soroka Medical Center
About Prof. Shaul Suckenik, may he rest in peace
He was a teacher and a friend who supported me and nurtured generations of doctors.
.
I first met Prof. Shaul Sochnik, may he rest in peace, when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I arrived for a rotation in internal medicine in the 4th internal medicine department that he managed.
I continued to return to the department during my sixth year of medical school, and I conducted my final project under his guidance, writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation in multiple joints).
Shaul had a significant impact on every significant junction in my professional life over the course of 20 years, and he was the most significant person in shaping my identity as a physician; not only professionally, but also - and mainly - on a personal and humane level.
During my internship, I debated between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted with him about choosing my specialization.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine under his guidance at Soroka Medical Center.
During my specialization, he provided me with constant guidance in various aspects, spanning scientific writing (I apologize, Shaul, I didn't dedicate enough effort), patient interactions, teamwork in a highly professional environment - an area where the department excelled - and essentially, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I identify in myself, both as a physician and as a manager, qualities that stem from Shaul.
When I completed my specialization and debated whether to go abroad for further training, Shaul pushed and guided me. He assisted me with recommendation letters and advised me on how to proceed.
The period of further training was a very important time for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and encouragement, I'm not sure it would have happened.
Upon my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital's management team, once again Shaul was the one who supported and assisted me.
Later on, together we successfully navigated through challenging periods in the Internal Medicine division.
Shaul had a remarkable ability to seamlessly integrate the roles of teacher, manager, colleague, and team player, without allowing his various responsibilities to interfere with each other.
I aspire to succeed like him in this unique combination.
He nurtured generations of students, interns, and residents who are currently spread throughout the medical system in Israel, perpetuating his excellent work and legacy through their actions.
It is an honor for me to be associated with this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of the Schneider Center for Pediatric Medicine
About Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and above all, attentive listening.
Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld, the founder and former director of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Schneider Children's Medical Center, taught me to be a pediatric intensivist, but more than that, he taught me to think.
The obvious lesson I learned from him is to care for the most complex and critically ill children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just moments ago, are now teetering between life and death.
Naturally, it involves conducting extremely difficult conversations, perhaps the most challenging ones, with families who never imagined they would find themselves in such complex situations in the Intensive Care Unit with their children.
It might sound strange, but it has become self-evident.
But I learned even more significant and profound things from him.
Looking back, as a physician who is also a manager and a manager who is also a physician, I can clearly see the connection between these worlds today; the education I received from Dr. Scheinfeld bridges the gap between them.
Dr. Scheinfeld taught me to listen carefully to many things: To listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nursing staff, to both the young and the experienced care teams, and to listen to the parents.
All of this needs to be done not only to communicate more effectively and successfully, but also to gather all the available information that can prevent further deterioration.
Preventive processes in the treatment of children exist everywhere, and of course in critical care.
Attentive listening and engaging in conversations promote a deeper understanding, both from the perspective of the caregiving team and from the side of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at the entire system.
The more thorough and meticulous the deep understanding that incorporates all involved parties in the dialogue, the decision-making process becomes more precise, tailored to the situation, and primarily early enough to prevent future, immediate, or distant harm.
This is why Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld is much more than just an inspirational figure for me.
He is a person who taught me a lot about medicine, but mainly taught me to think quickly and accurately, to listen, and then to implement.

Medical negligence during different stages of childbirth
In order to be eligible for compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that the harm was caused due to that same negligence.
Birth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in a family's life.
However, unfortunately, sometimes childbirth experiences can end with serious harm caused to the mother or the newborn as a result of medical staff negligence.
In cases where childbirth concludes with physical harm to the newborn or the mother, it is necessary to examine the sequence of events that led to the harm and consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in medical negligence will examine whether there were failures in the conduct of the medical team during the various stages of childbirth that led to harm. If necessary, they will seek consultation from a relevant medical expert in the field.
It is important to emphasize that not every error in medical treatment by the medical team constitutes medical negligence (in the legal sense of the term), and various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that the management was negligent.
So when is it considered negligence?
When a doctor's mistake arises from a lack of skill or falls below the reasonable standard of care, and this lack of skill and deviation from the accepted standard of care result in harm to the patient that wouldn't have occurred if the doctor had acted differently.
In this article, we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explaining the complexities that can arise in each stage, and when they might constitute medical negligence.
The contractions stage
The contractions stage lasts on average between 8 to 14 hours.
During this stage, the cervix gradually opens (to allow the baby to pass during delivery) and by the end of the process, it is expected to reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
The majority of cases of medical negligence during the contractions stage focus on failure to identify fetal distress prior to delivery, which can result in harm to the newborn, sometimes even leading to cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Cerebral Palsy may result from failure to identify or delayed recognition of the umbilical cord entanglement, which manifests as a deficiency in supplying oxygen to the fetal brain tissue during the second stage of labor.
In general, closely monitoring the condition of the laboring mother and accurately interpreting the monitor that tracks the fetal heart activity should lead to early detection of fetal distress, enabling the medical team to quickly intervene and deliver the baby before irreversible harm occurs.
Cases in which the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus is experiencing oxygen deficiency or misinterprets the data available to them, especially from fetal monitors, or responds with delay to distress evident in the monitor - may constitute negligence.
Brain damage can also be caused as a result of a umbilical cord prolapse and also as a result of an undetected uterine rupture.
Even in such difficult events, it is appropriate to investigate whether the medical team acted properly.
For example, attorney Anna Reif Lignza from the law firm "Kaspi Sror & Co." specializes in representing victims of medical negligence, explains that her firm handled a case of a child who was injured during his birth when the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac while the baby's head was too high. This led to umbilical cord prolapse (where the umbilical cord precedes the baby's head during birth), resulting in compromised oxygen supply to the baby's brain (due to pressure on the cord), and as a result, the child was born with severe neurological damage.
In another case, the attorney shared that her firm filed a lawsuit due to severe medical negligence against the team in the maternity department of a major hospital, when during childbirth, the medical team failed to timely recognize clear signs that should have raised strong suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the area of the previous cesarean section scar.
The fetus that was expelled through a tear in its mother's uterus into the abdominal cavity may experience severe fetal distress until its delivery at a later stage, when it is on the brink of death.
Due to the severe fetal distress during the course of his birth, the child suffered complex neurological disability.
It should be emphasized that in order to be eligible for compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that there is a causal relationship between the medical staff's negligence that led to the failure to identify the fetal distress and the harm caused to the newborn, so that the harm was caused due to the negligence as mentioned, and not due to any other reason or cause.
The examination of the causal relationship will be conducted by assessing medical measurements that, according to medical literature, only when they are met, a causal link exists between the failure to identify the fetal distress and the occurrence of brain injury.
Among other factors, measurements of fetal blood acidity levels, Apgar scores, the presence of neurological and systemic damage, and more are examined.
Fetal demise
The Active Labor Stage
The active stage of labor begins when the cervix dilation reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and concludes with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Delay in childbirth and avoiding the performance of a cesarean section.
In certain cases, dysfunctional labor, meaning lack of progress in the active labor process.
In such situations, a cesarean section is commonly performed to prevent various potential harms that may arise for the fetus due to the delay in childbirth.
"There are cases where failure to perform a timely cesarean section could result in irreversible harm to the fetus," explained attorney Reif-Lignza.
"For example, we handled a medical negligence lawsuit involving the wrongful death of a newborn due to significant delay in performing a cesarean section," she added.
Contrary to established medical practice, the medical team failed to identify the fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the particularly slow progress of the labor.
"The delay in performing the procedure resulted in extensive systemic damage to the newborn, ultimately leading to her death shortly after birth".
Negligence in childbirth with vacuum extraction.
In situations where there is a significant and immediate danger posed to the mother or fetus, necessitating an expedited conclusion of the birth, sometimes a vacuum-assisted delivery (vacuum extraction) is performed.
In this process, a vacuum 'cap' is attached to the baby's head using suction and pulled outward with force.
Consequently, this procedure entails risks and could potentially cause harm to both the fetus and the mother. Therefore, it requires caution, precision, and a high level of skill.
In such cases, medical negligence might manifest when the doctor fails to adhere to necessary guidelines and performs the procedure despite contraindications, e.g. where the fetus's head is positioned too high in the pelvis, performing the procedure for an extended period beyond what's permissible, or when the doctor continues attempting the procedure beyond the allowed number of attempts despite repeated failures.
In such cases, if the vacuum extraction procedure resulted in harm to the newborn – among other things, it could potentially cause skull damage and bleeding that may lead to the development of brain injury – there may be grounds for filing a lawsuit for damages.
Erb's Palsy
Erb's palsy refers to nerve damage occurring in the brachial plexus (a network of nerves that connect the spinal cord to the upper shoulder), and when this injury occurs during childbirth, it's important to investigate whether the damage was a result of medical negligence by the delivering team.
The injury presents itself as weakness in the muscles of the arm and can even lead to complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis sometimes occurs due to difficulties in delivering the baby, often associated with a condition called "shoulder dystocia." - an emergency situation during childbirth where the baby's shoulders become lodged behind the mother's pelvic bone after the head has already emerged.
When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused as a result of medical negligence?
In cases where the estimated weight of the fetus indicates that it is macrosomic, meaning that it is expected to be born with a weight exceeding 4.5 kilograms, it is preferable to deliver the mother through a cesarean section according to the guidelines.
When the baby's weight exceeds 4 kilograms, it's important to consider a cesarean section due to risk factors such as gestational diabetes and prolonged second stage of labor.
In cases where the medical team disregards the abnormal estimated weight of the fetus or other additional risk factors and chooses to proceed with vaginal delivery despite the risk of shoulder dystocia and Erb's palsy, there is a reasonable possibility that medical negligence is involved.
Indeed, in case 2694/90 in Israel, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk of shoulder dystocia during childbirth can be predicted in advance with a certain degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent its occurrence when there is a concern about it is by performing a cesarean section".
The placental delivery stage
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its expulsion occurs due to uterine contractions after the birth, and it is accompanied by bleeding.
In most cases, the process continues for up to half an hour after the baby's delivery, and according to many instances, it occurs spontaneously without medical intervention.
After the placenta is expelled, the medical team will examine whether it came out intact or if any fragments remain in the uterus.
During this stage, complications can occur that may lead to severe harm for the mother.
One of the well-known complications arising from retained placental fragments in the uterus is called "Asherman's syndrome" meaning the adhesion of the uterine walls due to inflammation caused by the presence of placental fragments, such condition can negatively affect the uterine lining, making it difficult for pregnancy to establish.
Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not identify retained placental fragments or did not take all necessary measures to prevent harm to the uterine lining despite suspicion of placental remnants, medical negligence might be involved. Such a case should be thoroughly investigated by an experienced attorney in the field.
Maternal mortality
Maternal death during childbirth is a relatively rare occurrence.
In such cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the entire family turns, unfortunately, into the most tragic event for her.
In certain cases, the medical team may not detect timely bleeding in the mother or may respond with delay to the bleeding as mentioned.
"For example," attorney Reif-Lignza shared with us, "our firm filed a lawsuit concerning a maternal death case, where in the same incident, the medical team ignored and did not respond for many hours to the vital concerning signs of the mother, they also delayed diagnosing a massive and uncontrollable hemorrhage, which occurred as a known complication of the underlying condition she was suffering from".
"In another case", attorney Reif-Lignza conveyed, "our firm represented a close relative of a mother who passed away following the birth of twins due to hemorrhage originating from the cesarean section incision that wasn't sutured properly.
In the same case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the surgery, yet the medical team did not adequately address her complaints and clinical condition, they only responded with a delay after her body systems began to fail, ultimately leading to her passing.
Uterine loss
In severe cases, medical negligence during childbirth can lead to uterine rupture. Attorney Reif Lignza states: "Our firm handled a lawsuit against a hospital where the basis of the case was a uterine removal due to medical negligence following childbirth.
In the same case, the young 31-year-old mother lost her uterus due to inadequate treatment of significant postpartum hemorrhage, which was observed by the medical team after childbirth. Despite this, timely actions that could have prevented the harm were not taken”.
What are the compensation amounts awarded in medical negligence lawsuits related to childbirth?
Compensation for birth-related injuries due to medical negligence includes various components of damages, with the most significant amounts often awarded for pain and suffering, medical expenses, rehabilitation and treatment costs, loss of income, and disability benefits for the victim and potentially even for their parents, and as well additional components of damages may also be considered.
Compensation awarded to an injured child for loss of income and disability benefits is often calculated based on the average income in the economy in most cases.
Additionally, compensation also includes medical expenses, costs of medical equipment and rehabilitation, adapting housing for the child's needs, mobility aids, and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined in each case according to its circumstances," attorney Reif-Lignza explains, and she adds, "Today, most medical negligence claims are settled through a mediation process that reduces the likelihood and risk for both parties in managing the proceeding", but she also mentioned that there are cases that only conclude with a court verdict. In such instances, if the lawsuit is not rejected, the plaintiffs can receive full compensation for all their damages, for example, in a case our firm handled, a district court ruling awarded over ten million shekels in compensation to a child who suffered brain damage due to delayed recognition of fetal distress”.
In summary
Medical negligence during childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare scenario for every family.
In such cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that led to the tragic outcome, carried out by a skilled attorney experienced in handling medical negligence claims, can help you secure the compensation you rightfully deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of the eye condition keratoconus in the south
Research has shown that there is a connection between the development of the disease and close relatives' marriages
The highest prevalence was found in the Bedouin sector
Expert: "It's possible that in any community where there are frequent marriages between cousins, a high prevalence of the disease can be found".
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes several visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it early and find appropriate solutions to prevent the worsening of the condition.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted to help understand the development of the disease, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new research provides a scientific basis for suspecting that keratoconus is a genetic disease.
A recent study that focused on the transformation of the corneal shape from convex to concave, revealed that the underlying cause of the disease and the weakening of the cornea's structure, leading to its distortion, is linked to an enzymatic imbalance, leading to a situation that the free radicals might potentially damage the proteins within the cornea, causing changes in its structure.
The source of that enzymatic deficiency is genetic, a fact that strengthens the hypothesis that keratoconus is an inherited disease.
According to Prof. Ariela Gordon-Shaag, Head of the Optometry Sciences Department at Hadassah Academic College, "In a study published among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of 3.2% of keratoconus was found.
The highest prevalence was among Bedouin students, with 20% having keratoconus, although the sample size was relatively small”.
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: "There is a high prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that close marriages are a risk factor for keratoconus.
This way, in any community where there are frequent marriages between cousins, a high prevalence of the disease can be found".
In this context, it should be noted that this finding is significant in light of the strongly implied conclusion: In cases where there is a family history of keratoconus, all family members are advised to undergo appropriate eye examinations promptly.
According to Arza Fruchter, Clinical Optometrist B.Sc., "We receive about ten times more referrals to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, mainly from the southern regions, compared to the central area".
Fruchter adds that "in the last decade, I've noticed that the majority of patients come from the periphery, especially from the Be'er Sheva area.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of consanguineous marriages within families (especially in the Bedouin sector), various allergies, and a lack of awareness for proper treatment of the issue”.
So, how is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus typically develops during adolescence or late teenage years (around ages 15-16 or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, accompanied by an increase in astigmatism.
Patients with keratoconus report distorted and/or blurred vision of shapes and objects.
These symptoms worsen as the disease progresses, which usually develops slowly and gradually over the years.
However, the disease can also develop rapidly and reach its peak within just a few months.
Many patients also report increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza, the IDF has today revealed the name of Lieutenant Colonel M.; Bennett: "Now, the people recognize the face of an Israeli hero".
Mahmoud Khair al-Din from the village of Hurfeish is the Lieutenant Colonel who fell in the operation in Khan Yunis.
Head of Military Intelligence: "The disclosure is deserved for him, his family, and his children".
In the future, the possibility of publishing a photo of Lieutenant Colonel Emanuel Moreno from the Sayeret Matkal unit will be examined.
three and a half years after the operation that took place in Khan Yunis, the IDF has today allowed the release of the name of the fallen soldier in the operation, Lieutenant Colonel M., who is Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Khair al-Din (may his memory be a blessing) from the village of Hurfeish in the north.
was 41 years old at the time of his death.
7Prime Minister Bennett stated after the disclosure: "Three and a half years have passed since Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Khair al-Din (may his memory be a blessing) fell in a covert operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and acknowledge his contribution and dedication to the security of the state.
“Colonel Mahmoud (may his memory be a blessing) was a warrior in the Sayeret Tzanhanim unit and later rose through the ranks of the IDF's special operations unit.
He is now adorned with the Chief of Staff's Citation posthumously".
I mourned him at his funeral, and now the people of Israel have the right to recognize him, his name, and the face of an Israeli hero, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Khair al-Din, in the open" said Bennet.
The community held him in high regard.
Since the operation, the IDF had refrained from publishing his name for security reasons, however, today, following a discussion led by the Head of Military Intelligence, Major General Aharon Haliva, with representatives from the military censor and with the consent of his family, it was decided to release his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, an Israeli hero, was born on December 28, 1977, in the village of Hurfeish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents, Ahmed and Nazira, and he had seven siblings.
He belonged to the Druze community.
He was married to Nahed, and was a father of two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter, and commander in the intelligence branch's special operations unit.
Throughout his life, Khair al-Din was a social leader, and the community held him in high regard.
He studied in the village school in Hurfeish until the ninth grade and then transferred to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he enlisted in the Sayeret Tzanhanim unit and completed Officer Candidate School in 2000.
In 2002, he was identified by the intelligence special operations unit and joined their ranks.
While serving, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002, he met his wife, Nahed, and they got married in 2004.
Their first son was born in 2009, during which he established an association with his friends working to promote the Druze community's status in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the "Acharai" association and started coaching a group in the village of Hurfeish, ensuring that the association began operating in Druze villages to encourage youth to enlist.
In 2013, their second son was born.
Major General Aharon Haliva, the Head of Military Intelligence, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "During the time we discussed the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din, an Israeli hero.
We have completed our work and concluded that there is no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.
It is also deserved for him, his family, and his children" he noted.
"An Exceptional Educator and Leader"
"Thanks to numerous operations, he is no less than a hero in my eyes", said Major General Haliva.
"He has a significant contribution, one filled with courage and spirit, to the State of Israel.
It is fitting that he receives the recognition he deserves".
"I did not know him personally, but he was an exceptional educator, a mentor, and an outstanding leader, not only in terms of operations but also in values" he added.
Major General Haliva noted that in the future, they will also consider whether to publish the picture of another hero, Lieutenant Colonel Emanuel Moreno from the Sayeret Matkal unit, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose picture has not been allowed for publication.
The operation in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
It was the culmination of months of meticulous preparations in which the intelligence community was deeply involved.
The command team for the operation included then-Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot, then-Head of Military Intelligence Major General Tamir Heiman, and then-head of the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) Nadav Argaman.
The objective of the operation has not been officially disclosed by the IDF, but it emphasized that it was a significant operation conducted by Israeli intelligence.
However, in Arab media, a communication device was presented as evidence that, according to the palestinians, was left behind by Israeli forces.
Hamas claimed that the operation was intended for planting surveillance equipment.
According to reports, on the day of the incident, the team traveled in two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint set up by Hamas members, and something in their behavior raised suspicions among Hamas operatives.
The operatives surrounded the vehicles and began questioning the passengers.
The on-site investigation lasted about 45 seconds, during which it became increasingly aggressive.
When the team realized they were in a precarious situation, Lieutenant Colonel Khair al-Din managed to divert the attention of the Hamas members, and in a split second, the team commander, Lieutenant Colonel A., opened fire.
Three Hamas members were killed in the gunfire, and tragically, Lieutenant Colonel Khair al-Din was also killed.
Ten months after the difficult event, IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Aviv Kohavi decided to accept the recommendations of the Turkel Committee and award three of the soldiers the Medal of Distinguished Service (Tzalash) in a deep operation within the Gaza Strip, including Lieutenant Colonel Khair al-Din.
The commander of the team and another fighter in the unit also received the Tzalash medal.
In the army's announcement, it was stated that Lieutenant Colonel M. received the Tzalash medal for "his actions in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, courage, and spirit, to defend his comrades.
He later acted with initiative and determination to engage the enemy, taking a leading role in seizing control and working diligently to advance the takeover.
To consider moving from "tweezers" operations to a broader operation,
Israel needs to once again ask itself whether it's appropriate to change its policy towards the Jenin area.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would erupt and ignite the Gaza Strip in its wake, but it's possible that the armed groups in Jenin will leave Israel no choice.
The tumultuous weekend we just experienced shows that even though Ramadan is behind us, the territory is still volatile.
It will require significant efforts and intelligence to pass through peacefully the two upcoming sensitive occasions: "Nakba" Day, which falls today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day, which will be observed in another two weeks.
Many factors will stand against any attempt to return to calm.
At the forefront, as always, are the terror groups, which are making a special effort to maintain the violent atmosphere of the past few weeks.
Evidence of this was provided during the recent arrest operation in which IDF officer warrant officer Noam Raz z"l was killed.
Fighters who took part in the battle in Jenin testified that they cannot recall such an extent of shooting and violence - having evidence not only of the enormous quantity of weapons in the area but also of the willingness to use them.
This necessitates Israel to ask itself once again whether it's appropriate to change its policy towards the Jenin area, moving from small, intelligence-based "tweezers" operations to a broader and mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would erupt and ignite the entire region. Even now, the security establishment prefers to operate selectively when necessary to prevent escalation, but it's possible that the armed groups in Jenin will leave Israel no choice.
To extract lessons for future events.
The death of Raz in the battle is the best response that Israel can give to anyone claiming that it deliberately killed the Al Jazeera journalist, Shirin Abu Akleh.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it and those present in the area.
The IDF takes significant risks with its forces to avoid harming the innocent, sometimes paying for it with the lives of soldiers.
This reflects high ethical standards but also holds operational-intelligence value. A captured terrorist - as happened the day before yesterday in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about terrorist organizations, attacks, and other terrorists; This information is often difficult to obtain through other means and can help prevent future attacks.
The IDF acted correctly when it released the interim investigation conducted in the Abu Akleh case, making it clear that at this stage, it cannot determine who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it's doubtful that a definitive conclusion will be reached in this matter.
It seems that nothing will convince the convinced: The world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with expressions of empathy for the Palestinian terror victims - the original reason the IDF is relentlessly operating in Jenin.
As always, stories like these tend to fade away.
The global public's attention is currently occupied elsewhere, particularly with the intensifying war in Ukraine.
Therefore, it's a shame that Israel insisted on giving extra moments of exposure to the Abu Akleh case, with the poorly managed police handling of the funeral.
Even if Abu Akleh's family did not comply with the preliminary agreements, one should have expected a bit more professionalism from the officers escorting the procession and certainly less excitement about the Palestinian flags that were waved.
Responsibility demands: To calm the situation down.
The Minister of Internal Security and the Police Commissioner have done well by ordering an investigation into the incident.
It seems, however, that they lacked sufficient preparation and clear instructions. Troublingly, this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short period, in two different districts.
Also in the Dizengoff attack, the police failed in managing the event, isolating the scene, and dealing with the media.
It's good that the investigation committee will not only analyze the conduct of the officers during the funeral but also extract lessons and conclusions that will enable better handling of similar events in the future.
In addition to the internal police response, attention must also be paid to the behavior of elected officials who have lost their way and purpose.
In the Israeli Knesset, there are several members who are seen as a threat to democracy.
They come from both the left and the right and use their parliamentary immunity not to challenge the state but to harm it.
Knesset Member Ofer Cassif is the latest example of this; If no steps are taken against him, including legal action for assaulting a police officer, the country may encourage the next elected public figure to escalate their actions.
Actions like these, which are in terms of defensive democracy, are crucial in the scattered reality of this era, where various forces seek to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with a clear mind is expected to rise above all of this and work to calm the situation; Otherwise, Israel may quickly slide into turmoil, not just facing external enemies but also dealing with internal rivals.
A senior police officer: "Government policy and goal setting are required here".
Israel's police may have launched an operation to mitigate the phenomenon of illegal residents, but there is still a long way to go.
There is currently no single entity in the State of Israel that comprehensively addresses this issue".
"If we want to deal with the phenomenon of illegal residents, a government policy is required, and from it, goals, missions, and responsibilities must be derived.
Currently, no single entity in the State of Israel comprehensively addresses this issue", says a senior police officer.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon manifested itself with about 20,000 to 30,000 infiltrators entering daily through breaches in the fence.
In addition to that, between 100,000 to 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel daily through 34 controlled crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each sector is limited by the quota set by the Israeli government according to the security, economic, and political situation in the State of Israel.
Permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, an illegal resident is not necessarily a palestinian whose entry is forbidden due to criminal involvement or links to attacks; in many cases, it refers to Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not comply with the permitted quota.
It is emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff, and Elad were considered illegal residents, but they were not supervised because they had not committed any criminal offenses that required security forces to monitor their movements.
"Therefore, there is no significance to their entry through breaches in the fence", says a senior security official, "Anyone who wants to carry out an attack can enter the country through controlled crossings, and there have been cases like this in the past".
Thousands of Arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of the increasing alerts for attacks, the police launched a wide-ranging operation to locate illegal residents.
As of the end of the weekend, approximately 16,000 illegal residents were arrested.
Out of those, about 600 were investigated, criminal cases were opened against them, and around 200 were detained.
According to the police's prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal residents are only conducted against recurrent offenders or those involved in criminal activities again and again (Recidivists).
An illegal resident who is arrested for the first time is investigated, documented, and then returned to the territories.
Sometimes this process repeats itself on the second occurrence, but it is only on the third occasion that they are arrested, detained, and charged with unlawful presence.
According to the law, if an illegal resident is apprehended within a range of about 50 to 100 meters from either side of the separation barrier, the military legal authorities handle their case.
Data obtained by "Israel Hayom" indicates that in 2021, the police dealt with 40,010 illegal residents, smugglers, and infiltrators.
7,405 illegal residents were arrested, and criminal cases were opened for 19,533 of them.
The number of employers, smugglers, and infiltrators handled by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and criminal cases were opened for 5,640.
"The fundamentals of the phenomenon of illegal residents do not depend on the police, the IDF, the Israeli society, or the Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors", says a senior law enforcement official.
"To address this phenomenon, we must address their motivation to work in Israel, and on the Israeli side, we must impose a price that prevents them from crossing the barrier.
Stakeholders in this issue claim that the failure to impose this price is due, among other things, to a lack of detention facilities and the fact that arrests only occur when accompanied by other offenses or when dealing with recidivists.
Legal experts argue that the decision to impose a price on illegal residents only began after the third arrest, partly because the courts cannot cope with the number of daily arrests.
Anyone who examines the punishment will find that it is not deterrent enough".
There is great complexity
"Illegal residents", says a police source, "are complex individuals".
He can be a father for a family that enters the country to work and earn a few shekels and then return.
This is the basic platform, and many types of illegal residents enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks.
An illegal resident can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, the police have arrested illegal residents as young as 16, and even children aged 8 to 10 who were sent by their parents to intersections on the roads to earn a few shekels from drivers.
"This also complicates the matter because in such cases, we need to bring the parents and file charges against them for child abandonment," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel as day laborers.
The most non-common jobs are in construction and advanced building jobs.
In the past, local authorities also employed illegal residents in garbage collection, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 crossings, there are about 18 main crossings.
Some crossings are for vehicles and goods, some only for people, and some serve both purposes.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossing Authority.
Illegal residents are usually smuggled into Israel by private individuals because it involves easy cash.
"There are those who do this to make a living, and there are gangs whose main business is smuggling illegal residents", says a senior police officer, "Usually, most of them are Arab Israelis who speak the same language and communicate with them.
This can cost between 100 to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies don't engage in this because if the company is caught, it may be shut down".
In the police, they emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting illegal residents can be considered as an offense.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses and insurance, who collects Palestinians at designated points at set hours, including organized pickup, is usually not breaking the law", says a senior police officer, "Those who know they are smuggling illegal residents usually pick them up at night at hidden points, including disembarking at hidden points.
Most of these guys prefer to travel in an old car because they know it might be seized".
Documentation: Burning fields in Zippori
The territories suffer from numerous fires, with damages reaching tens of thousands of shekels.
In this regard, the "New Watchman" was established in an attempt to combat this difficult phenomenon.
.
In the documentation that reached "Israel Hayom," it can be seen that agricultural lands in the Zippori settlement are on fire.
These agricultural lands belong to Chaim Zilberman.
The lands are suffering from significant damage, with losses totaling tens of thousands of shekels.
It should be noted that in response to this situation, the "New Guardian" was established in an attempt to combat this serious issue.
Home Front Command Exercise: These are the times when sirens will be activated in your settlement
As part of the "Chariots of Fire" exercise conducted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sirens will be activated on Sunday, Monday, and Wednesday at various locations across Israel.
In the event of an actual emergency, an additional alert will be triggered, and the Home Front Command application will provide real-time updates on the situation.
The Home Front Command is conducting drills today (Sunday) and later this week, simulating various scenarios, including rocket launches and hazardous material incidents.
This comprehensive preparation is an integral part of the broader "Chariots of Fire" general exercise.
Here are the scheduled dates and times for siren alerts and Home Front Command application notifications:
Sunday (15/05):
At 10:05 AM, a siren alert will signify rocket and missile firing in the Ganey Tikva settlement.
Monday (16/05):
At 10:05 AM, a siren alert will signal rocket and missile fire in the heart of Tel Aviv.
Wednesday (18/05):
At 10:05 AM, a siren alert will indicate a "hazardous materials incident" at Tirat HaCarmel.
Furthermore, in the event of an actual emergency scenario, an additional alert will be issued, and real-time information will be disseminated through the Home Front Command application.
Terrorists targeted IDF soldiers with explosive devices, the soldiers responded with return fire, resulting in the neutralization of one of the attackers.
Security forces stopped 13 wanted individuals in various areas of Judea and Samaria.
During the operation, IDF forces fired at suspects who threw explosives at them, a hit was detected
The director of the Jenin Hospital, where the assailant Maher Marei, a 25-year-old resident of Jenin, was taken, reported that he was shot by IDF fire.
Israeli forces, including the IDF, Shin Bet, and Border Police, apprehended tonight (Wednesday), 13 wanted individuals in various locations within the Judea and Samaria region.
These operations took place in areas such as the village of Roshida and the city of Shechem.
During an operation conducted by IDF troops in the city of Jenin, part of the Manasseh Regional Brigade's jurisdiction, two individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activities were apprehended.
Additionally, while carrying out this operation, IDF forces came under attack from suspects who threw explosive devices towards them. Gunfire was heard in the area.
a hit was detected.
The director of the Jenin Hospital, where the assailant Maher Marei, a 25-year-old resident of the Jenin refugee camp, was taken, reported that he was shot by IDF fire, which led to his death.
In a separate operation conducted by IDF troops in the El-Azeh refugee camp, located within the Etzion Regional Brigade's jurisdiction, a wanted individual suspected of involvement in terrorist activities was apprehended, and combat equipment was seized, during this operation, several suspects threw stones at the forces, prompting a response that included the use of crowd dispersal means and live fire of Ruger gun.
a hit was detected.
Furthermore, arrests were made in the village of Silwad, east of Ramallah, where three students associated with the "Al Kutla al-Islamiya" were detained, the group is linked to Hamas and is known for recent violent clashes with Palestinian students from Birzeit University and security personnel on the campus.
Need to Launch a Criminal Investigation Against Her: The Haifa City Comptroller makes serious accusations against Einat Kalish Rotem
The City Comptroller's report presents an apparent fear of criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality and political opponents: Monitoring of employees and an inflated payment to an accountant's office for carrying out investigations •
"The difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation"
No response was given from the Haifa municipality.
Surveillance of municipal employees and political opponents and an inflated payment to an accountant's office for carrying out the investigations, "at the expense of the public purse".
A report by the City Auditor of Haifa, Ofer Tal, released yesterday (Tuesday), presents initial concerns of potential criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalisch-Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality and political rivals.
According to the allegations, Kalisch met with the accountant's office Bar-Lev & co., requesting investigative audits.
These investigations were conducted under names and codes provided to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to council member Sofi Nakash, and it was checked whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash's family are compliant with regulations.
The report also highlights a lack of order and absolute control over the work of the State Comptroller, with whom Kalisch had met.
The City Treasurer is the municipal authority responsible for coordinating and synchronizing the tasks of the City Auditor with the various departments within the municipality, and the data collected by the accountant was not transferred to him.
As a result, no one within the municipality were aware of the projects overseen by the accountant and the scope of work required for each of them.
Furthermore, the hourly reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
This led to a situation in which the scope of issues in which the accountant was involved grew disproportionately, along with significant interference in the routine operation of the municipality, without any supervision or monitoring by the municipality.
In summary, the audit recommended suspending payments that had not yet been made to the accountant until material specifying the scope of work for each of the audits reviewed was received.
Furthermore, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were listed under codes such as "Gatekeepers", Information Store, Fish Store, Investigative Audit for the Mayor, and Investigative Audit Report of Purchase.
Shortly thereafter, the City Attorney for Haifa, Yamit Klein, stated that the mayor herself signed off on the payment in place of the City Auditor.
She stated, "I was not invited by any audit report, and I am not aware of what this is about".
It was also revealed that the cost of the investigative audit was two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels have been paid, with half a million shekels remaining to be paid from the tax funds of the residents of Haifa.
The former municipal treasurer, Jackie Vakim, responded: "These despicable actions that were done for the purpose of tarnishing my name and the name of elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the Haifa taxpayers are a criminal offense."
Sofy Nakash, a member of the City Council, responded: "The auditor's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves".
Sarit Golan, an attorney and a member of the City Council, commented: The difficult findings presented in the report necessitate the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the consultant for investigative auditing, to conduct investigations. It raises doubts about whether some of them were legally carried out, especially the investigations related to the opposition's council and former senior employees.'
Lior Datz, from the "Shomeri HaSaf" association responded: "It seems that all the red lines have been crossed when a public authority sends investigators details in order to gather information against lawyers who represent an association that exposes corruption and at a time when the association is conducting public proceedings against the administration of the Haifa municipality."
The Haifa Municipality did not provide a response.
Yehuda Berlav, the accountant office, declined to comment.
Gantz Exposes: "Iran and Hezbollah Collaborated to Undermine UNIFIL Activity in Lebanon"
The Defense Minister participated in the International Cyber Conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel is familiar with the cyber systems of its rivals and their methods".
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Al-Sayyid in Hamas captivity: "A video aimed at extortion - on the verge of a humanitarian issue".
Deputy Commander of Unit 8200 Reveals: "We Thwarted the Attempt to Contaminate the Water Systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke this morning (Wednesday) at the International Cyber Conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University, where he exposed a joint operation by Iran and Hezbollah to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "Another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on Lebanese civilians and the stability of the country", said Gantz.
Gantz also referred to the documentation of Hisham Al-Sayyid, who was released from Hamas captivity in Gaza: "Yesterday, a video aimed at extortion was published - on the verge of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas holds four children captive, contrary to international law, contrary to morality.
Hamas is responsible for this, and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal behavior of Hamas".
He added that "The State of Israel acts in various ways and continues to leave no stone unturned to return the children home.
As we have said in the past - this is a humanitarian issue, that is how we see it, and based on this, we will continue to act.
Extortion attempts and awareness exercises will not affect our position and our conduct".
He then revealed a joint activity of Iran and Hezbollah: "Iran is also operating its proxies in the cyber dimension. I can reveal today that recently there has been activity by Iranian security bodies in cooperation with Hezbollah in order to harm the activity of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This was done by implementing a cyber operation aimed at stealing materials on the deployment of UNIFIL, and using them by Hezbollah.
This is another harm by Iran and Hezbollah to Lebanese civilians and the stability of Lebanon".
"Israel is familiar with the cyber systems of its rivals and their methods.
In recent years, we have seen a phenomenon of hacker groups acting on behalf of Iran, operating against Israel and other countries", Gantz continued.
"The 'new proxies' are terrorists with a keyboard who are like those of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we strike at them and their operators, and today too they are on our agenda - not only in the cyber dimension.
No cyber attack on Israeli citizens will be tolerated.
The responsibility lies with the attackers and the state that funds and sends them.
Cyberattacks can be responded to in various ways in the cyber domain and in other domains".
Gantz continued to attack the nuclear entity: "Iran leads the cyber terror - and makes moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the US presidential elections and in other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Actions like those of 'Shahid Kavah' that gathered information about ships, fuel stations, and industrial facilities in several countries were done under the direct directive of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in investigations".
He also added that "in recent years we have thwarted many attempts to infiltrate private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber responsibility' and to punish companies and organizations that do not act in accordance with the guidelines".
Gantz continued and marked the next goals of Israel against threats: "Our top mission, in the military, in industries, and in various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and make them stay.
I and the Chief of Staff have made this issue one of the central missions in the relevant units.
We examine the building of the force all the time - both in terms of human resources, training, and mission issues.
In the coming years, we will also need to examine the organization, management, and operation of the cyber unit, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system".
In conclusion, the Defense Minister called for cooperation with the world: "There is great importance to our cooperation with the world against Iran, also in the cyber dimension.
The same cooperation that we are building in the region against Iran in aspects of defense against various threats - we are expanding in the cyber dimension as well".
Deputy Commander of Unit 8200 Reveals: "We Thwarted the Attempt to Contaminate the Water Systems"
Uri, Deputy Commander of Unit 8200, stated in the unit's first public appearance at this type of conference, that Israel successfully prevented an attack on its water systems.
"Cyber threats are a central part of our activities.
Our goal is to achieve superiority over the attacker, to identify them, and to take action to neutralize their capabilities", said the Deputy Commander of Unit 8200. He went on to explain, "At times, we also discover victims outside of Israel, and in such cases, we establish connections with other agencies when necessary.
We do this both independently and through cooperation with industry and other agencies, utilizing tools we have developed.
Unit 8200 will not rest until the threat is eliminated".
As mentioned, this is how the threat to Israel's water systems was exposed and thwarted, and also how an attempt by a specific adversary to target Israel was detected.
In another case, we identified that a certain adversary was targeting Israel, and during our investigation, we found that the same attacker also attempted to target power stations in the United States.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We successfully prevented this threat through close cooperation with our American partners".
This is how police is preparing to neutralize terrorists in civilian population The Jerusalem Border Police (Magav), launched a new facility named "Asaf" simulates firing in a crowded area in response to the recent series of attacks that have occurred in recent months.
A guide for counterterrorism by the Jerusalem Border Police: "The development provides a relevant response to attribution threats and simulates the reality in the field".

A Glimpse into the "Asaf" Facility
Getting Ready for the Next Attack: A series of terror attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, resulting in the deaths of 19 people and injuring around 70 civilians, led the Border Police to develop a unique technique for training fighters to engage terrorists within a civilian population and conduct shooting while in motion.
Exposed by "Israel Hayom": A Glimpse into the "Asaf" Facility
The grassroots terror focuses on targeting civilians, aiming to disrupt the necessary sense of security required for the normal functioning of a civilian population.
The wave of severe attacks this year, including incidents in Be'er Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and notably the one that occurred in early April on Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, carried out by a terrorist infiltrating a crowd, prompted the police to engage in creative thinking for the development of a tool to train fighters to confront terrorists within a civilian population.
The thought process was led by the Training Division of the police force and the Border Police.
They competed in various police districts under the title 'Commanders Leading Learning,' where each district was required to develop tools to aid in the improvement of surveillance and combat skills of the fighters, officers, and commanders.
Within this competition and as a response to the need for Border Police fighters to practice shooting while in motion and in scenarios of this kind, Asaf Ben David, a counterterrorism instructor for the Jerusalem Border Police, developed the 'Asaf Facility.' This facility comprises a dynamic target connected to a telescopic pole, which is attached to a harness worn by the instructor.
Once the instructor has strapped the carrier to his waist, he can practice the fighter in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It's worth noting that in recent years, Border Police officers and fighters have encountered numerous attacks in which the assailant posed a threat while in motion within crowded civilian areas.
The current version of the 'Asaf Facility' is based on components and parts derived from various fields.
For instance, the telescopic pole used in the facility was adapted from maintenance and cleaning equipment.
This facility allows the simulation of shooting while in motion within a civilian population, aimed at a dynamic target while maintaining visual contact with the subject, managing movement during shooting, selecting a path for advancement, and conducting selective shooting exercises, all while preventing harm to uninvolved individuals.
Warrant officer Asaf Ben David, for whom the facility is named, states, "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in training and preparing fighters and police officers.
The development provides a relevant response to attribution threats and simulates the reality in the field.
The advantage of development versus relatively low production costs provides us with a significant edge in competition".
State Comptroller Warning: "The Central Election Committee Is Not Prepared for Cyber Threats".
Matanyahu Engelman participated in the annual cyber conference of Tel Aviv University and expressed concern about cyberattacks on Israel.
"World War III will be a war of hackers, but the world is not prepared for it".
State Comptroller Mattaniho Engelman participated today (Wednesday) in the annual cyber conference of Tel Aviv University and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
“We are exposed.
Our data is accessible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our healthcare is exposed, and our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not prepared for it".
Engelman mentioned that, as part of cybersecurity audits conducted by his office, significant deficiencies were discovered: "In the past year, we conducted penetration tests at the Jerusalem Traffic Management Center, hospitals, and the Tax Authority's systems.
During the audits, we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were conducted by public bodies, and some of them performed penetration tests only during the audit.
In addition, there were shortcomings in readiness, and the Central Election Committee is unprepared for cyber threats".
"We, at the State Comptroller's Office, we are committed to continuing to address this significant issue for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the world as a whole" he concluded.
Heading High: "I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles".
Choosing the Reds: "From the very beginning, they showed me they wanted me. I'm built to lead a big team".
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: "I felt like I had a place. I want to be in the squad for the Eurobasket"
And the time at Maccabi Tel Aviv: "I learned to focus only on what I can control".
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will leave today with the Israeli national team players to Poland, where they will face the local team in the early stages of the 2023 World Championship (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia in the Shlomo Group Arena.
In parallel with intensive training with the national team, Blazer has also been focused on his future over the past week, until he signed a two-year contract with Hapoel Jerusalem.
I have peace of mind now that I've found a team", he tells "Israel Hayom" in his first and exclusive interview since signing.
"I do have some pressure now because I need to find an apartment with my family after settling in the central region, and it's not easy, but there are no more phones, and professionally, I'm much calmer now".
You haven't been on the national team for four years, how happy are you to return, and how much do you want to play in the two upcoming games?
"First of all, I want to enjoy being on the national team, and I come with an attitude of contributing in any way I can, whether it's from my experience or on the field.
Of course, I would be happy to play, but when you come to the national team, everyone needs to set their ego aside and do everything to make the national team succeed.
I'm here for whatever they need from me".
Now you are 14 players, and Danny Abdia will join the European Championship, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and there may be other changes as well.
Do you aim to be in the squad for the Championship?
"I would be happy to be on the field and contribute".
Blazer, 29 years old (1.99m), played for Maccabi Tel Aviv for the past two years.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue with the yellow team, and after a few weeks, he moved to the capital, choosing Jerusalem over Hapoel Holon.
You had other offers, and why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
"They showed a very strong willingness for me to be there, so the negotiations were relatively easy.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I understood that this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and suitable to me.
I'm here to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I talked to Coach, and he has a mentality of hard work and winning, which is exactly what I bring.
I've always loved playing at the Arena because I get energy even when the crowd is against me, and now that they'll be on my side, it will be even better.
I'm sure there will be a committed and enjoyable team, and I wanted to be a part of it".
Can you expand on your conversation with Coach Dzjikic?
"From a professional standpoint, he believes in a lot of off-ball movement, plans to bring good passing with IQ basketball, and wants an extremely intense team.
He believes in high energy in both defense and offense, and with the Arena crowd, it can be successful".
I looked at your career and saw that in every team, you stayed for at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel that you can also stay in Jerusalem for several years?
"There are those who do this to make a living, and there are gangs whose main business is smuggling illegal residents", says a senior police officer, "Usually, most of them are Arab Israelis who speak the same language and communicate with them.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone hasn't stopped ringing and buzzing.
I received many messages that they are already waiting for me.
So I believe we have a good period ahead".
Do you think you can be a more significant player in Jerusalem than in Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you sum up the two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv?
"Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control in the last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional throughout, no matter how many minutes I received - I always gave it my all.
I'm proud of the way I conducted myself last year, and now everyone is going their separate ways".
If it were up to you, would you have wanted to stay with Maccabi?
"After the last year, it was clear to both sides that we were heading towards parting ways, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season, I had a bit less playing time, and my position diminished, even though I had an excellent period in the middle of the year, but they decided to go in different directions.
Once I understood the situation there, I realized it was less the place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me, and that's why I chose it".
Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
"A lot has been said about what happened in the Cup semi-final last season when I shouted at Ami Biton (Maccabi Tel Aviv's team manager, YM) 'This is why I'm here', so, that's why I came to Jerusalem – to win titles".

All or nothing: Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera drew 1:1
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but managed to equalize just 10 seconds later.
Later on, the midfielder was sent off with a doubtful red card (74).
Hadera also ended up with ten players after Ido Levi's red card (87).
Hapoel Jerusalem's coaching staff counted the foreign players on the pitch quite a few times tonight, more than once, and at one point even realized that they had one player less (Guy Hadida was ejected).
This time, to their delight, everything was in order, and the 1:1 draw against Hapoel Hadera will not be appealed by the Israel Football Association's disciplinary court.
Before the red card he received, he managed to score an own goal and equalize to secure a valuable point for Ziv Arie.
Already in the 33rd minute, the individual performance of Guy Hadida began.
Plakuschenko lifted it into the box, and the midfielder rose and headed backward, and the ball stopped in the net of his own team.
0:1 to Hadera, who enjoyed the midfielder's own goal.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida managed to redeem himself tremendously - Levkovich caught air, and this time the midfielder headed in the right and exposed net.
1:1 at Teddy Stadium.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to record a second yellow and a red, this time after sliding into Marmentini's direction.
Daniel Bar-Natan opted for a doubtful red card and sent the midfielder straight to an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar-Natan also showed a red card to Ido Levi, balancing the forces on the pitch.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Hapoel Holon
60:85
Ariel Beit Halevi's team connected a third impressive victory in a row •
Huber and Shochman (15 pts each) excelled
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey continued this evening (Saturday) with an impressive 60:85 victory over Hapoel Holon, bringing their seasonal head-to-head record to 0:3 in favor of Holon.
Since descending to last place, Ariel Beit Halevi's team has already achieved three consecutive victories, which is a surprise only to those who didn't watch the game.
Holon hasn't looked this bad in a long time.
All this before the start of the series against Besiktas in the Champions League Play-In: Only 60 points, no three-pointers in the first half, and 11% for threes throughout the game.
Bottom line, it was not an impressive evening for all the players on the team (except for Raffi Menco, who made three three-pointers for Holon), including the sure bet Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in great form, thanks to Roi Huber and Choakin Shochman (15 points each).
The former regained his form recently, and the latter returned to flourish, dazzling with a three-quarter-court basket.
Give them a chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv's Israelis saved Sferopoulos
After losing the derby and eight consecutive European losses, a defeat to Jerusalem's in classico - would probably end of the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach •
So who does Yanis have to send flowers to tonight?
To his Israeli staff, who were responsible for 42 critical points at the Arena •
And also: Why the yellow club needs to change its 'Americanization strategy' and learn a live lesson from the Ariel Beit Halevi model in Eilat
It's hard to remain cynical at the sight of tearful eyes and warm, tight hugs that Yanis Sferopoulos gave his players at the end of the game this evening at the Arena, especially in light of the tight loss and secret handshake with John Dibartolomeo, who probably saved the Greek coach's job, and maybe the whole season.
Because after a home loss in the derby and eight consecutive European losses, losing to Jerusalem in the classico, and moving away from it by three victories in the standings?
That would likely have concluded the Israeli-Greek romance tonight.
So for now, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, especially regarding the EuroLeague.
First of all, Maccabi Tel Aviv arrived with an extreme change in offensive habits and ball movement.
The ball moved with passes, lots of movement, and drills, and Scottie Wilbekin, notably, left the job of running the show to Evans, who dribbled very little and mainly passed the blocks and went to score.
Despite poor shooting from Scottie Wilbekin (2-9 from the field), he contributed on defense, and more importantly, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players also scored.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team reverted to old habits, and the offense returned to isolation plays, and in the most critical offensive moment, with a 2-point lead and 40 seconds left, Scottie dribbled to half the corner and shoted one-foot floater that almost costed him the game.
The wisdom lies in continuing to execute drills and passing movements, especially in clutch moments, and this should become ingrained in the team's DNA.
The important lesson should be for Giannis and the club regarding the use of Israeli players.
Those who have become water carriers and towel wavers in European games.
Tonight, they scored for the coach who had lost faith in them, contributing more than half of the team's points (42 out of 83), and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four out of the top five scorers for Maccabi were the Israelis.
And don't say that Israel is not Europe.
If they can dominate against Jerusalem, the most European-like team in our league, they can also help in EuroLeague.
In the first half, it was mainly Ouz Blazer, whom this sports section has been clamoring for a month to play more.
He scored, passed, fought under the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive tenacity and basketball intelligence.
Isn't that enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen stood out with excellent percentages from all ranges, providing cool mind from beyond the arc and helping cover for Zizic's injury, and especially John Di, who, in a situation of 70:63 for Jerusalem, changed the momentum with five consecutive points.
Giannis has a complex relationship with Yiftach Ziv, and sometimes, it seems he gives him too much credit and responsibility, risking defeat.
This also happens in the EuroLeague, as it did tonight.
However, the important lesson should come from the club regarding its strategy of relying on American players.
It's a fact: Senior Israeli players are no longer eager to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Raffi Menco returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or perhaps he was rejected by Maccabi.
This is happening because gradually, there are fewer spots for Israelis in Maccabi, due to the club's deliberate and rooted choice to rely on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach a point where there won't be Israelis willing to play for them, Then they will look for Jewish kids to naturalize and push to increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a crucial mistake by the club.
The game we saw should remind Maccabi that they exaggerate with foreigners, largely because of the tax discount.
Certainly, we're not claiming that Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So, instead of spending the same money on one star and eight mediocre players, they can get five excellent players.
For example, this season, with the money spent on Williams, Nanali, Evans, Reynolds, and Taylor, it was possible to bring in two efficient and stable stars (a center and a forward) alongside Scottie and Zizic.
This would be more efficient, more correct, more Israeli, more beautiful and interesting, and it would create identification.
True, there are two busy frameworks and a long season, so you have to rely on your Israelis.
And also, because you are an Israeli team, representing Israel, and even receiving tax benefits from the country - quasi-representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association/League management can help Maccabi and return to reason with a number of foreigners tailored to the Israeli league.
Six on the roster, four on the form, a maximum of three on the court at the same time.
Does the league need so many foreigners just for Maccabi, given the prolonged unsuccessful achievements (seven years in Europe)?
What about the players' organization?
Is that why you went on strike?
There were two Israelis on the court, and now there is only one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargain for gaining less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for the teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if someone needed reinforcement in that direction, Hapoel Eilat did it so beautifully in the early game and explained it so nicely.
With three foreigners, plus four Israelis who were only secondary in the youth teams (Hober, Ben Moshe, Roina, and Shukman the warrior), it dismantled Hapoel Holon (second in the league!)  for the second time in two weeks.
It is a tradition in Eilat to play well with three foreigners because there was such a run during the days of Dan Shamir and many during the days of Sharon Drucker.
Eilat, the short one, is just a more balanced and efficient team, and there is no one like Ariel Beit Halachmi, who started in the open fields in Givat Shmuel, to show us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is in their prime, everyone plays together, and all the Israelis learn and improve their game.
The foreigners just complement.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from their knee injury, it will be a terrific team.
A song I dreamed about Eilat.
And that Maccabi can learn from it about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "It felt like the whole world was against us".
The yellows are happy after the 78:83 victory over Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena: "We returned to play the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play".
The conversation between Ami Biton in the locker room, the initial optimistic diagnosis of Zizic's injury, and the management's approval for acquisitions.
A great sense of relief to Maccabi Tel Aviv after the important and prestigious 78-83 win over Hapoel Jerusalem on Sunday.
The players of the team and the management embraced coach Giannis Sfairopoulos, who appeared very excited at the end.
Yiftach Ziv and Ouz Blazer poured water with enthusiasm on Drick Williams, who excelled in the game, and other members of the club also wore big smiles of happiness, showing how much pressure they had released after a recent series of losses.
They, too, were afraid of humiliation against the formidable opponent that would further destabilize the system.
The fans in the stands also remained for long minutes to celebrate.
"There is an amazing connection between us and Giannis in the locker room", said Oz Blazer.
We know that the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We were really looking forward to this, also with the way we played.
We returned to play the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with heart and fighting spirit, We stand behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and spoke to us".
Before the game, the team's manager, Ami Biton, entered the locker room and said emotional things to the players.
"His words had a big impact on how we came out and how we played on the parquet", said Maccabi players.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi is already focused on the important game against Baskonia on Thursday and wants to break the long losing streak in the EuroLeague.
"I believe that this game will change the momentum for us", Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games in the end, and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we did not break.
"In recent games, we were under a lot of pressure. Giannis told us that if we are relieved, we will win these games.
I believe that this victory will take us forward.
Many eyes are on us, and there was a feeling that the whole world was against us, I am proud to go to war like this. We disconnect from everything around and look only at ourselves".
Ante Žižić, who was injured in his right knee during the last quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the locker room, and the initial diagnosis was not severe.
Doctors will examine how the knee responds today, and then it will be clarified how many days of rest he will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Baskonia.
In addition to the strong support given by the management to Sfairopoulos and the professional staff, in a meeting held on Thursday, the professional manager, Nikola Vujcic, received a green light to bring one or two players to strengthen the team, the yellows hope to add quality acquisitions soon.
Anthony Bennett released from Hapoel Jerusalem
The forward, who was the first overall pick in the NBA draft, couldn't adapt to the team from the capital city •
The club bid farewell: "Anthony has entered our hearts, we thank him for his time at Hapoel".
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released today (Sunday) from the team's roster.
The forward (28, 2.03m) who was selected first in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers averaged 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games in the Champions League and 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in the Premier League.
"Hapoel Jerusalem and the player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a mutual decision to terminate the player's contract with the club", the club stated, "Anthony has entered our hearts, and we thank him for his time at Hapoel.
We wish him nothing but the best and success".
Research determines: Zoom meetings impact creativity.
Approximately 2,100 engineers and academics worldwide were asked to develop solutions to a problem – some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings.
The result: Virtual meetings impede creativity and thinking outside the box.
The research was led by Columbia University: "Visual focus on the screen hinders the ideation process."
Anyhow, it's not so bad: There is no impact on work performance or critical thinking.
A recent scientific study published in the journal Nature examined the influence of video conferencing on the creativity of participants, compared to in-person meetings.
Unfortunately, it was found that creativity is indeed affected in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question, led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University, was whether remote computer-based meetings preserve the creativity found in in-person brainstorming meetings or if creativity and free thinking decline due to the distance.
The research itself began in 2016 but gained significant momentum during the two years of the COVID-19 pandemic when many people shifted to remote work.
"In an in-person meeting, people are moving in the room, use objects, and rely on them for creative thinking", says Brooks.
"In a computer-based meeting, on the other hand, the focus on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
Visual concentration on the screen narrows cognition.
People are more visually focused on the video during interaction, which hinders the broad and expansive ideation process".
The space is constrained.
To examine the experiment's results and verify if they would repeat themselves, the tests were conducted twice - once at Columbia University and once in real-life situations - with engineers who were already acquainted.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty members and students into two parts - in one, the participants were asked to meet in person and develop solutions to a problem, and in the other, they were asked to do it via a computer.
Simultaneously, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia were similarly divided and asked to solve a presented problem in a new way.
In both cases, a decrease in creativity and thinking outside the box was found among those who met virtually via video.
Jay Olson, a post-doctoral researcher at McGill University in Canada, who specializes in measuring creativity, was not surprised by the results.
In his view, during creative thinking activities, people often look at their surroundings for inspiration, which helps generate new ideas. However, in video meetings, thinking is concentrated on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity to flourish.
"When people are in the same room, they look around and see the space, objects, and situations that can trigger new associations.
In contrast, the research shows that computer-mediated relationships change our focus so that we are more internally and screen-focused, and this narrows innovation and idea generation through observing the environment and thinking beyond".
There is no impact on critical thinking.
Nevertheless, before managers bring employees back to the office, the researchers point out that "working via a computer did not affect autonomy itself and not the critical thinking of individuals on innovative proposals when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
In other words, the impact is specific to creativity and not to other forms of computer-mediated work."
Professor Ellen Langer, a psychology professor at Harvard University, also supports these findings.
According to her, "There is a distinction between mere creativity, such as coming up with new uses for a paperclip (one of the research questions, AG), and the solutions of work.
"It's also possible that when employees become more familiar with each other or when they work from home, creativity may indeed improve."
Both Professor Langer and Dr. Olson also suggested future research in which such meetings are interrupted by thinking and wandering around the room to see how this activity will affect the final outcome.
Dr. Olson also proposed that, following this research, employees should not return to work solely based on one study but instead conduct further investigations in the field.
"I wouldn't want employees to be forced back and not be happy; that's a greater detriment", he says.
Musk is waiting for Trump's return: "It was not right to ban him".
The recent purchaser of Twitter said that he will reverse the decision that led to the suspension of the former U.S. president's account.
"I think it was a mistake", he admitted.
The owner of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter in an estimated $44 billion deal, said today (Tuesday) that he intends to bring Trump back to the social network, after he was blocked while he was still president after his supporters on Capitol Hill rioted following his loss in the election against the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.
"I do think it was not right to ban Donald Trump.
I think that was a mistake", he said.
"If there are incorrect and harmful tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and suspension - temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban", Musk clarified.
Until 2050:(43)The world will lose 80% of its available water for agriculture The world will lose 80% of its available water for agriculture
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years.
The solution: Proper water management
A recent and alarming study published in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050, the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the current patterns of water consumption and global population growth continue.
In this study, scientists from all science agencies worldwide compiled data on the total amount of precipitation, rivers, and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to the human demand for agriculture.
The grim findings of the research show that the current rate of water consumption has doubled repeatedly over the past 10 years, while global warming is causing a decrease in precipitation in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study's data, 84% of the world's agricultural lands will experience severe water shortages.
(51)One of the key conclusions arising from the research is a call to farmers worldwide to adapt agriculture to climate change and seasonal variations, transitioning to cultivation methods that reduce water wastage to prevent water depletion.
Additionally, researchers recommend that farmers working near brackish water sources utilize rainwater collection technologies to prevent the flow of freshwater into the sea.
Information about many students at Bar-Ilan University has leaked online.
The hackers who targeted Bar Ilan University's database a few weeks ago threatened to release the students' information if they didn't receive a ransom payment.
The threat has been realized, and the information has been widely published on the internet.
Students at Bar-Ilan University are under attack by hackers, with their personal information being widely published online. The attacker, known as Darkrypt, made demands for an unspecified ransom from university personnel several weeks ago and threatened to release the information under their control if the ransom was not paid.
Estimates suggest the ransom initially started in the thousands of dollars and increased significantly before the information was released, reaching several million dollars.
Facebook groups for university students and staff are filled with angry messages as chaos reigns. Students cannot access their personal information systems and cannot carry out routine academic tasks.
The university sent out an email distribution notifying about the attack on the academic institution and emphasizing their intensive efforts to minimize the damage. In the email, they also provided some details about the information that had been leaked online.
No specific instructions were provided to those whose information was compromised, but it is mentioned that the university has implemented a series of security measures.
Good news for 40 settlements: The optical fiber arrives in Benjamin
The goal of issuing peripheral permits for high-speed internet continues, and now the optical fiber is reaching the Benjamin Regional Council, which includes 40 settlements.
The project, in cooperation with the council and telecommunication companies Telran, X-Fiber, and Internet Rimon, will commence immediately after the holidays.
The Benjamin Regional Council signed a unique agreement over the weekend for the deployment of optical fibers in all council settlements.
The agreement with the "Net-Fiber" initiative, in collaboration with "Internet Rimon," "Telran," and "X-Fiber," was signed after the conclusion of a large tender that the council has been working on for the past few months.
Work will begin after the holidays, and residents of the council's 40 settlements who wish to connect to the optical fiber infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 gigabit and advanced end-user equipment for their homes, allowing for strong Wi-Fi reception, as required these days.
Participants will be able to choose between fast internet over optical fibers or fast filtered internet over optical fibers, which will be provided by Internet Rimon.
The council ensured that the market remains open to competition in all circumstances.
Israel Gantz, head of the Benjamin Regional Council, said: "This is true Zionism.
This is great news for residents.
The quality of life in Benjamin will improve, students will be able to learn remotely if necessary, working from home will be possible, and advanced businesses can be established in settlements that will have high-quality, uninterrupted internet.
I want to wish success to the dear companies in their execution tasks in the settlements.
The residents are waiting for you".
Gantz added, "Soon we will have one of the best, high-speed internet conditions in Israel.
We have been working tirelessly for months to bring the infrastructure for laying the fibers, and now the vision becomes a reality.
I thank the Minister of Communications, Yoaz Hendel, who started the project with us in his previous term, the council's team who believed in the project, and the CEOs of the companies who won the center with their professional quality in Israel."
CEO of Internet Rimon, Yariv Pe'er: "I thank the head of the council, Israel Gantz, and his team for immediately raising the bar to bring good news to the thousands of council residents who will switch to high-speed internet, upgrading the quality of life in education, the economy, and of course, leisure."
CEO of Telran Communication Group, Shai Aslan: "We are pleased with Benjamin Regional Council's decision to connect to fast and powerful internet infrastructure, and I am confident that thanks to our group's extensive experience, we will be able to provide residents with fast internet just like in the center of the country."
CEO of X-Fiber, Israel Elitzur: "Establishing communication infrastructure in Benjamin is the Zionism of 2021. X-Fiber is proud to be part of the establishment of the new infrastructure in Benjamin's peripheral areas. I have no doubt that due to our familiarity with the areas of Judea and Samaria in general and Benjamin in particular, we will meet any engineering challenge to bring high-speed internet to every home in the council."
We checked: What do the side effects of the coronavirus vaccine mean?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weakness, fever, and fatigue after receiving the shot, while others feel nothing at all.
Can this indicate a stronger immune system for those who do experience these side effects, or is it just a baseless rumor?
As more and more people get vaccinated, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are unfounded.
Does the immune system of those who develop stronger side effects than those whose bodies react less vigorously to the vaccine, possibly indicating that their immune system is unable to fight off the foreign body that enters their system?
There are several levels of vaccine reactions", says Dr. David Dvir, Head of the First Medicine Department at Meuhedet Healthcare Services and a member of the advisory committee for epidemic treatment, and reassures: "Headaches, fatigue, and localized pain are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body responds to the entry of a foreign body into the system."
Is there a correlation between the levels of antibodies developed and the side effects?
There is no correlation between the sensations and the development of antibodies against the virus.
Around 60% to 50% experience side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
It's not found that people who develop strong reactions are more protected".
There is no correlation in the medical literature between an immediate reaction and the level of the vaccine.
In some experiments where people received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them experienced headaches.
It's also a psychological component - how a person perceives the vaccine, whether they expect side effects.
Many of the symptoms that occur could also happen normally, but because the public is vaccinated, they attribute the reaction to the vaccine itself, and this is a common bias regarding vaccines in general - attributing symptoms that occur shortly after vaccination to it".
According to Dr. Dvir, the reasons for the reported common side effects, like weakness and headaches, are still unknown.
Regarding myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation), opinions are divided.
There are various theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One of the theories is that it's a strong response of the immune system".
Is it possible to assess a strong immune system?
When students were exposed to the flu virus, those who didn't sleep well or were under higher stress were more susceptible to infection.
Aside from that, there are practical parameters that assess the immune system or its components.
When there's a decrease in the immune system, it's immediately noticeable.
People get many viral or infectious diseases.
It's not that someone walks around with a weak immune system without being aware of it.
These are people who come for investigations because of recurrent and changing infectious diseases, and what affects the system are trivial things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want an overly strong immune system because it can cause autoimmune diseases".
Soon, mRNA vaccines will appear in other contexts, thanks to the extensive knowledge accumulated in recent times.
There's no doubt that it will open the door to other vaccines of this type.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines - for treatments of oncological diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is because the substance remains in the body for a very short time - it enters, performs its action, and then breaks down.
This technology isn't new, but it received a significant boost due to the great need for a fast vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that a gap of three weeks between doses is too short, and some vaccine experts argue that after the third dose, we may not need another vaccine in the near future. So, it's not clear whether we're heading towards a situation of a vaccine every six months or whether the third dose will provide a much longer gap."
Thousands were affected: Severe privacy breach on Route 6
Route 6 customers?
It is possible that your personal information, including full names, addresses, payment amounts, and detailed information about your journeys, has been exposed.
According to the Privacy Protection Authority's allegation, Derech Eretz, the operator of Route 6 in Israel, violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
After Derech Eretz, the operator of Route 6 in Israel, reported a security incident that occurred within the company, the Privacy Protection Authority initiated an enforcement process.
As part of the incident, security vulnerabilities were discovered in its payment website, allowing the exposure of extensive billing information from the company's customers, which was exposed to anyone.
Among other things, billing statements for customer payments were exposed over an extended period, and these statements included personal information, including first and last names, payment amounts, vehicle locations, travel dates, and times.
Furthermore, since Derech Eretz did not document access to its systems as required by law, it was not possible to determine precisely how long unauthorized individuals had access to the company's systems.
In the violation notice sent to the company by the Privacy Protection Authority, the authority emphasized that most large companies and organizations in the economy are required to adopt dynamic information security policies. With the development of threats and risks, organizations are obligated to carefully assess evolving risks and act accordingly by updating conventional security measures based on the circumstances and the nature of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations are required to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and penetration tests to examine changing risks and prepare for them.
Additionally, companies and organizations are required to use an automatic documentation mechanism and provide training to employees, in accordance with the regulations of privacy protection (information security).
Based on the findings of the supervision, the authority determined that the company violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations and demanded that the company take several corrective actions.
Derech Eretz, the operator of Route 6, stated: "The matter has been addressed in accordance with the strictest requirements."
The Travel Warning to Istanbul: Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus Airlines will allow Israelis to change the destination or date of their flight.
A message to Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: Airlines will allow changing flight dates.
Reminder: Earlier this week, the counter-terrorism headquarters raised the Istanbul travel warning level to four.
This is the highest level, meaning "high threat level: Do not go to this country, and if you are there, leave as soon as possible."
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus stated that they will allow Israelis who booked their flights before the travel warning was issued, meaning before June 13, 2022, to change their destination or flight date.
This is by making an inquiry to the airline.
Tourism Minister Razbozov said, "Israeli citizens should not have to pay an economic price due to terrorism threats.
I am pleased that major airlines like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request, and I hope that other airlines will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey due to the severe travel warning".

Getting closer, Saudi Arabia skies: Israeli airlines are preparing to expand routes to the East.
The summary emerging for a broader flight permit over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing for the launch of new flights to the Far East instead of destinations in Europe.
The largest airline in Israel is planning significant changes for the arrival of U.S. President Joe Biden in Israel.
As we published in "Israel Hayom," the estimation is that Biden will announce approval for El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations beside the United Arab Emirates.
The implication of this emerging agreement is that El Al can fly shorter routes to far-eastern destinations and to Australia.
To achieve this, the airline will need to cancel flights to less profitable destinations to free up planes for new destinations.
The destinations that will be canceled starting next November are Warsaw, Toronto, and Brussels.
These are three destinations with significant Jewish populations, but at this stage, they are less profitable for the company.
In contrast, the new destinations being considered by El Al include Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, and other places in the Far East.
Here's how the process will unfold: The Dreamliner planes currently flying to Canada will be released for long flights to the East.
The Boeing 737 planes currently flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be repurposed for flights to destinations like London and Paris, which El Al currently operates using Dreamliner planes.
This means that the airline can effectively release larger planes for flights to additional destinations in the East.
At the same time, El Al expects discussions to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility for Israeli airlines to resume flights to Turkey, and to do so, the company plans to operate flights using El Al's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Travelers returning from countries that are not red are exempt from isolation in quarantine facilities, the foreign tourists return.
Those landing in Israel received messages from the Ministry of Health stating that they are exempt from the obligation to isolate with a negative coronavirus test result.
Only after that, the Ministry issued an official notice stating that this exemption applies only to travelers coming from countries classified as "orange," even though there were reports of receiving the notice by those returning from "red" countries.
Additionally: Tourists from "orange" destinations will be allowed to enter the country, and many "red" destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
In the height of the pandemic - the end of isolation for returning from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent messages to those returning to Israel this morning (Monday), stating that they are exempt from isolation upon receipt of a negative coronavirus test result performed after landing in Israel.
This includes those returning from "red" countries.
Some of the messages sent informed returning individuals that they can be released after receiving a negative test result or after 24 hours at the latest, and some received the exemption after receiving the negative result.
Only after that, an official notice was issued by the Ministry of Health, stating that starting from midnight on January 4, 2022, vaccinated or recovered individuals returning from "orange" countries will undergo a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and will enter isolation for 24 hours or until they receive a negative result (whichever is earlier).
The decision will be anchored in an order by the Director-General of the Ministry of Health and will be brought to the approval of the Knesset Health Committee.
The Ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovered individuals who have already returned to Israel from an "orange" country and received a negative PCR test result upon entry to Israel will end their isolation tonight at midnight and are not required to undergo a second test.
However, travelers from "red" countries have reported receiving the same message.
Those who are not vaccinated or recovered and return from an "orange" country will enter home isolation for 14 days, with the option to shorten the isolation period after receiving a negative PCR test result performed from the 7th day after landing in Israel (the day of arrival being the first day).
The decision to lift most of the restrictions on travelers, especially vaccinated individuals, comes one day before a hearing in the Supreme Court filed by the Association of Travel Agencies, Open Skies Headquarters, and the Hotel Association.
In the hearing scheduled for tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand the removal of all other "red" countries from the list, while Professor Itamar Grutto supports them with his opinion.
Foreigners will also be allowed to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism, and Transportation have agreed that starting from Sunday, January 9, 2022, the entry of vaccinated/recovered foreigners (according to the Ministry of Health's definition) from "orange" countries will be allowed, subject to online form submission in advance, performing a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, performing a PCR test upon arrival in Israel, and then entering isolation for 24 hours or until receiving a negative test result (whichever is earlier).
Non-vaccinated/non-recovered foreigners (according to the Ministry of Health's definition) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from "red" countries, except those approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The group quarantine outline will not be renew at this stage.
What about "red" countries?
The Health Ministry's committee for classifying countries has recommended to the government to remove the following countries from the red list and move them to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain on the red list at this stage are: UAE, USA, Ethiopia, United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option being examined by the Health Ministry is to exempt vaccinated individuals returning from red countries from isolation.
At the moment, it is unclear if there is a connection between the messages received by those returning to Israel this morning and the guidelines that may be issued by the Health Ministry on this matter.
The Health Ministry has not yet responded.
The skies are starting to open up: The Health Ministry is changing the restrictions on entry to the country.
Vaccinated individuals returning from orange countries will be required to isolate for 24 hours.
The countries United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates will be classified as red.
After several weeks during which it was very difficult to find a destination to travel to without restrictions, and after all returning from abroad were required to quarantine, alongside a ban on tourists entering Israel, changes to the regulations were decided upon yesterday, significantly easing restrictions at Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend canceling the three-day quarantine requirement for Israelis returning from orange countries.
Until now, anyone vaccinated or recovered according to the Ministry of Health's definitions who returned from an orange country was required to quarantine for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Now, the quarantine that vaccinated and recovered individuals returning from orange countries will have to enter is a maximum of 24 hours, or until they receive the results of the coronavirus tests performed after landing at Ben Gurion Airport (the earliest among them).
Those not defined as vaccinated or recovered will still be required to enter a seven-day quarantine, subject to two coronavirus tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if they return from an orange country or a red country.
Vaccinated or recovered individuals returning from a red country will also be required to enter full isolation.
The current updated list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs government approval, includes the United States, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.
In all of these countries except Turkey, the percentage of positive cases entering the country in the past two weeks is more than 5% of the total entries, which automatically places them on the red countries list.
The rate of increase in the number of patients from Turkey is fast, with over 4% of those returning from there testing positive, which is why it was decided to include it in the list of red countries.
The prominent countries removed from the red list are: France, Spain, Portugal, and Canada.
Meanwhile, starting from January 9, fully vaccinated tourists according to the Ministry of Health's requirements will be allowed to enter Israel without the need for quarantine, under conditions similar to those for Israelis returning from an orange country.
Also in this case, the decision is subject to government approval, which will be discussed in the coming days.
It's important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the Ministry of Health's recommendations in this regard.
Tourists against the restrictions.
The Association of Travel Agencies, the Open Skies Headquarters, and the Hotels Association filed an appeal to the Supreme Court to lift the restrictions on flights.
The country removed most of the restrictions yesterday but, as mentioned, left eight significant countries on the list of red countries.
In the discussion to be held this morning in Jerusalem, the appellants are expected to demand that the country cancel the list of red countries.
Supporting the appellants' position is Professor Itamar Grutto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Minister of Tourism Yoel Razvozov, who has supported easing restrictions on foreign tourists entering Israel in recent weeks, said yesterday: "The cancellation of quarantine for vaccinated individuals returning from abroad and the return of tourism for the vaccinated are the right and correct things to do at this time.
I thank my government colleagues who understood the dire situation of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighs the benefit.
The vaccine is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, it is up to the vaccinated public to live a life as normal as possible alongside the coronavirus".
With an investment of 200 million shekels: The new resort that will open near Arad

Chef restaurants, private pools and 110 rooms are just a small part of what the hotel will offer •
All the details in the article
7MINDS, a subsidiary of Patael, and The White City Real Estate company acquired a 20-dunam plot of land in the Judean Desert, where they will build a luxurious resort with an investment of about NIS 200 million. The hotel will be built on the same area where a Masada hotel was built that was destroyed about a year ago.
The resort, set to open in about three years, will have 110 rooms, some with private pools.
It will also feature three communal pools, a spa, gourmet restaurants, a leisure complex, a fitness room, and more.
Chef Ran Shmueli from the Claro restaurant will be in charge of the resort's culinary side.
Chef Shmueli will be the one to build the menu which is expected to have a desert concept unique to the resort.
Mayor of Arad, Advocate Nissan Ben Hamu, welcomed the project: "The decision to establish a new and luxurious hotel near Arad officially seals the amazing transformation that Arad has undergone in the field of tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the entrepreneurs' choice, and I am convinced that it will be a joint success since Arad has enormous tourism potential."

It's a shame
It would have been more interesting to hear how many people received royalties via the Israel Post, how much the rental cost of the branches is (located in sought-after city centers), and how much the employees' salaries are (minimum).
It's forbidden to privatize Israel Post
The question is how many packages have arrived and how many have been distributed?
Because some of them disappear
People order packages, and they disappear at the sorting center in Modi'in...
There should be a package fee of 5 shekels so that people won't order random stuff for a shekel and burden the postal service
It mainly reflects the cost of living in the country.
Thanks to the fucking king who caused it to be better to buy everything from China.
We're a household and try to avoid going near the post office, hoping not to receive any letters from them, and our hatred for the postal service has led us to give up on anything related to post.
A good week.
To dismiss all postal workers and start the postal service from scratch - by a private company.
Arrogant employers and some of them are racists!

It's amazing that she's still getting job offers, in her profession it's not something to be taken for granted...
Indeed, there's nothing like walking on the main road♥
A wonderful family♥
A few years ago I had a dream to chain on Esti Zakheim the cow on her head with her red boras.
Beautiful and talented!
How did you win a "Shomer Shabbat" person
A person devoted to their spouse and children.
Extremely talented.
Looking forward to her performances with great anticipation.
Perfection! :-))
World champion you are!
Talented and amazing Inbal, good luck
You're gorgeous, that's you!!! :-)
Mazal tov!
Well done!!!
Love won!!!!
Mazal tov!!!
Don’t worry, It won’t last long.
At the moment, there's no benefit in it
How do you know it's true love ...
They reunited after 20 years!!
And she is older than him
And he is handsome, rich, and famous
And in a few months, there will be reports of a breakup.
There are women who can wake up every morning with a new husband.
It's a shame he didn't participate in Eurovision
Let's hope that maybe next year he will participate with his original song
There will take place the big breakthrough
Instead of the arrogant egotist from the supermarket they brought, and he only made a disgrace
Where did this confused Greenberg come from? Hahaha!
Who is he?!
Why is he appearing on a news website??
Here, it's not the Guy Pinnes program, and it's not the garbage site of Nonsense Moses
He smears it like tricky inviteded PR under the guise of an article by a flatterer reporter-for-a-penny, hiding behind the newspaper's head office name.
The joke is on us the readers, the captive audience, those who escape from the poisoned Moses  and are looking for an alternative
The song isn't to my taste, and the video is also random
Lovely, lovely, lovely
What a talent!!!
We want more and more from him
Tamir Greenberg is a great singer on the level of an international star.
The State of Israel is small for him.
He will break through abroad in a big way.
A clinical Optometrist?!
Oh Really, her 'degree' isn't recognized in her home country...
Who's the next sector in line?
Bibists?
And mapping of the corneal wasn't mentioned at all.
Clinical Optometrist, wow.
She's a clinical psychologist on behalf of herself only.
Where will the sirens be?
War is looming, they are preparing us
And what will the Battle shocked do, what a cruelty
Bennett Lapid and Gantz at the behest of Biden: Get ready, friends, get ready...
Because they are the champions of champions!!
Hahaha, don't worry, even when managed by incompetent and extremely foolish leaders, we have capabilities beyond expectations!!
True, and besides, our shelters are mostly screwed up.
The Home Front Command is playing 'as if' games because in real-time - we better won't know...
Why only on Tel Aviv
All the rest are right-wingers garbage.
Despite the nice words, we haven't heard about the arrest of the hackers, their prosecution, and the judicial process against them
In the four previous election campaigns, was the Election Committee prepared for a cyberattack?
Why not specify, for example...
How many infiltration and disruption attempts were made, and how many succeeded in infiltrating the Elections Committee in the last three years.
Isn't it due for us to get some data, facts, and proportionality?
One of the more unusual signings for Hapoel Jerusalem.
Good luck, Oz.
You will always be part of the Maccabi dynasty...
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
Seeing black all of you, just accusations and responses, classic armchair quarterbacks.
Baldwin is a social bomb in the locker room, that's what players who played with him in both Greece and Spain say!
Hollins got injured and didn't play in the last games of the red star...
Hilliard also got injured and hasn't played for the past six months...
Heavy bets.
Maccabi lacks a star
What's really going on with Brown
If Maccabi doesn't sign him, there could be a problem
What about Lorenzo Brown?
Hahaha, how fitting, like a glove to a hand, a loser to the team of...
Adam is a great player, the coach needs to give him more minutes and not to give up on him, Hapoel must have a large squad, it's forbidden to give up on him
No.
To bring in Adrian Banks.
We need more strong Israelis in the squad.
Ones who really play
Much more suitable Maccabi that being built than Wilbekin.
You can see there are professionals at Maccabi - Blatt and Katsch.
Perhaps individual skills still don't compare to Scottie, but he's a team player, and especially has a much higher basketball IQ
It's really sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners, while the Israelis warm the bench
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not as a collection of foreigners, so they won't succeed with all the stars they bring in from around the world
Who cares about them anyway???
If you're already watching a game where 6 American players and 3 Israelis are just for show, isn't it better to watch a Golden State game instead???
It’s a puzzle, until it be solved - the league will end
Good luck with that
Good column.
I liked.
Regarding Israelis, he is completely right!!
And a note about Ziv - we saw in the past season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So, in the Europa League he can't be a leader, but his drop in performance even in the league indicates that he has lost confidence (and it's not surprising after the treatment he received after 2 not-so-good games in the Europa League, as if the others never had such games), and maybe using him is also not right, and it's a result of the coach's rigidity and templates.
Blaser doesn't shoot well, with all due respect...
Yiftach Ziv shouldn't be in Maccabi Tel Aviv, he ruins it too much
Sometimes he has a good game, but Surkin and Blazer Dudi and also Cohen today, well done.
Ido Eshed is a looser who received 500 shekels, so he writes nonsense.
In the picture it’s not Federman.
Blazer, Surkin, and Jack Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor, who in Europe play for twenty minutes and can't make a basket, who needs foreigners with zero level, It's much better to let the Israelis to play.
It's good that there's a positive atmosphere for everyone, the coach, players and management, in maintaining the momentum.
Depends on strengthening internal reinforcement...
And a required and disciplined reinforcement by a coordinator and guard...
And this is the part of the management.
Not true.
Non-mediated human interaction is incredibly important across many aspects.
The answer to this research is that social isolation is harmful even from a professional and truthful perspective, and what surprises and disappoints here is the unexpected outcome.
So, turn off the camera on Zoom, and the problem is solved.
What happened, did the researchers use Zoom, and therefore their creativity wasn't enough to solve this issue?
How can we know what will happen in another 30 years
Somebody here missed an important detail
The scientists are not interested in global warming or rainfall
They are only interested in the rate of population growth
They are working on more and more vaccines and covert methods to destroy the world's population, so they tell us fake stories about global warming and other nonsense they invent
There is no problem with water desalination, in unlimited quantities
It was said 50 years ago.
In the meantime, there are more people.
The solution is limiting birth rates, especially in impoverished areas, and in the case of Bibi's Baboons, the other anti-state leftists, and all religions that believe in gods - among the ignorant, the fools, the imbeciles, the blind, or simply put - among the herds
There's an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living organisms (including left-side humans) consume oxygen and emit carbon dioxide.
The solution is: Leftists, kill yourself!
It’s green.
Good for the world.
It will be better for you, and for sure the earth and for all of us.
Who are the scientists and how did they conduct the research
I don't believe in every research that talks about climate change because I don't think it exists
It is designed to control us and rob us of our freedom and liberty.
It's all part of the New World Order.
Writers like Asaf Golan are on their side, just like they were during the time of the coronavirus.
I've never heard him present facts from both sides; he always brings forward the side that serves the globalists.
They ‘Bennet’ us.
They're just burning money on "academic" rubbish research.
As usual, more rubbish from the land of delusions of the psychopathic left-wing.
Actually, the situation is improving. Human knowledge is expanding, along with new technologies and improvements.
For hundreds of years, the world population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
For example, the Chinese have embarked on a massive project of desert warfare in Gobi with astonishing success.
The Saudis are doing the same thing and succeeding as well (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
Ironically, the "climate crisis" nonsense from the leftists (carbon dioxide emissions, essential for plant growth) is actually causing the Sahara to become greener. But hey, that doesn't fit the leftist agenda, so you won't read about it in the newspapers...
The leftists aren't concerned.
With them, urine goes straight to the head, which is why they don't get dried out.
Is proper water resource management means reduction of at least 70% in the world's population?
It's remarkable that COVID came, and it's astonishing that the majority of the population is being injected with an experimental substance whose long-term effects on those injected for a span of 5-25 years remain unknown.
It's also astounding that Agenda 2030 is being set in motion, and now this?
The whole story is really strange!!!
Hahaha, what a bullshit.
The stories of One Thousand and One Nights, all fear-mongering and, of course, the nonsense of the left trying to control the world through media manipulation, five years ago they declared there would be no more rain in Australia, and this year they have enough rain for two years.
They also said that there wouldn't be more rain in Israel, and the drought is permanent, yet here we have rain.
They also claimed Rabin didn't murder Jews in Altalena, and that Peres didn't know they were kidnapping Yemenite children.
Of course, Moshe Dayan didn't plunder antiquities, and Ezer Weizman didn't messed with his female soldiers.
It's clear that you're promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting bullshit.
They should also take care of reception in tunnels, handling power interruptions and voltage drops, while we're on the move.
“This is true Zionism," just like the opening of a Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
Following Bennett the swindler, the rest of the flatterer politicians are in the same line in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I wouldn't go near El Al, more likely 'Nail Al'...
It was very pleasant, goodbye and never see you again.
You won't see us even in dreams.
Another big disgrace, we are in Israel imprisoned by El Al, all direct flights in its hands, hogging prices, it’s better go bankrupt already, time for truly open skies.4
How much people are focusing on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows El Al to fly over its territory, it won't contribute more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not a game-changer of such magnitude.
It's better to focus on more interesting achievements, such as energy supply, purchasing Israeli technology, transportation from ports in Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, tourism, and allowing Israeli beverage companies to operate in Saudi Arabia.
It's much more interesting than 30 flights a week that would save an hour each.
It's more important to allow Israeli Air Force squadrons to be stationed in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran, and to coordinate with the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt, and Morocco to attack Iran continuously with weapon for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And to station another Air Force squadron in northern Saudi Arabia to strike Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from a less congested eastern area.
After we finish with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti, and the Comoros Islands to a peace agreement with Israel and achieve the majority of Arab League countries that have joined the peace.
After a change of regime in Iran, the conclusion of the World Cup, stabilization of the oil and gas market, and replacing Erdogan in Turkey, it's possible to assist Saudi Arabia in toppling the government in Qatar and definitively eliminating the nation's influence, as well as its support for other Muslim groups and Hamas.
When all these common interests conclude, then we can talk about more El Al flights, if El Al even survives until then.
El Al should be shut down.
They are selling tickets for flights that aren't taking place.
The worst part is that there's no way to reach a representative
"No customer service".
Anyone who buys a ticket from El Al and wants to change or cancel it can forget about it; it's a definite loss.
You've been warned.
Air Canada is better
In any case, we prefer flying with foreign airlines
‘Arkaka’ has turned from a crappy company into a company from hell
El Al also declined in quality.
Best to order a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And come by train to the airport
€40 per suitcase on Ryanair is much cheaper than on Wizz.
You can carry a backpack weighing 8 kg.
Why are you misleading?
Wizz Air charges significantly more for baggage and seating!
One big nonsense
Just for example, I recently flew with Etihad
The allowed weight is 30 kg.
And a Trolly is 7 kg.
And each additional kilogram costs $30
Who should know this before?
All companies are ripping off the customers.
They advertise very cheap prices, but in the end, it's about a bag the size of a school backpack.
Trolley already costs money, and a suitcase is very, very expensive.
"Luckily, airlines don't require us to come to the flight wearing only underwear and a undershirt just so save weight on the plane.
On El Al, the price isn't cheaper, but rather 50% off when booking within 6 hours before the flight.
Israelis are not surprised at all.
Israelis have remained shady businessman, using the successful method of exploitation of other.
Land of problems.
To this must be added genetic avarice.
It's also a shame on our country that allows foreign airlines to exploit Israelis...
There's no government, and everyone here does as they please
So, what did you learn today? That it's not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket...
They prepared a surprise for all of us...
You will pay extra for the airplane wheels, for the windows, for the missing luggage, for the food, for the drinks, and surely they will add charges for the toilets
In short, just stay at home and the prices will come down...
Or a great idea: travel by ships
The journey will take several days
You'll vomit, and then it seems you'll also arrive
Bennett wants to test how much he can attack and harm Israel while still gaining popularity and support from his new fans.
To open now?
It's not by chance.
Especially when the chaos begins, there's an exemption, it's just incredibly strange what's happening here...
This isn't the peak of the pandemic.
Simon, it doesn't suit you.
The number of confirmed cases increasing doesn't necessarily mean the number of patients is rising.
Stop getting tested for every little thing, stay at home if you're not feeling well.
End of the story
A government of clowns.
The government, and especially Bennett, are in bankruptcy.
Loss of control.
And mostly stupidity
ובלבול הציבור, ציון 0.
Only more harm than benefit
I suggest you open a new corner: "Daily and Cumulative Death Toll from the Start of the Fifth Wave.
The Faces and Images Behind the Neglect."
Your ratings will soar.
You don't understand that: the finance minister, in order to avoid paying compensation to tourism workers
They are bringing more contagion
They don't care about the people
8,500 have died so far
Is anyone talking about it?
They are burying us, especially the elderly
We've become like Russia/North Korea.
If we're not talking about it, it doesn't exist!!
The main thing is that the citizens will put money into the state's treasury to inflate the salaries and pockets of the ministers and bureaucrats!
It seems that ‘Dobermann’ and Abbas are the prime ministers!!
Very well, the Omicron quarantine was relevant for the first week; now, there's no reason to isolate oneself half-heartedly, and there's no point in trying to stop Omicron – which is more prevalent here than in Israel.
When someone arrives from an orange-listed country, statistically, they are less dangerous than those already present here.
This is the first time I'm seeing genuinely logical steps from the Israeli government in the fight against COVID-19.
As if someone actually sat down and calculated the numbers, and not like Bibi – did whatever seemed better for him in the newspaper (and failed in every clause).
The government of the “foolish wises” at its best:
The finance minister who tells the tour guides to find a new profession two weeks ago, is now opening the skies for tourists.
The education minister, foolish ‘Shasha’, is ignoring the prime minister and the health minister, setting her own policy and throwing all the schools into absolute chaos!
The foreign minister, a clown, arrives sick with COVID-19 to the cabinet meeting.
And the most clownish Prime Minister we have had in the country, does not control the situation and loses his temper like the worst hooligan ever.
Simply a government without leadership and direction, causing all of the people in Israel to lose trust in it.
Go home, as soon as possible!
In my view, perhaps this doesn't originate from a negative source, but rather from a place of losing control.
Now apartment prices there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
So, where are all the fortune tellers now?
They're building a bus station and believing it will affect all the houses.
By the way, apart from “protection” fees.
After they discover the exorbitant property tax rates, the hotel in Arad will return to being a white elephant like its predecessor.
Looks amazing.
Best of luck!
I want it.
What about the art of photographing completely naked?
Giving up on the rubbish.
A serious fight for Sde Barir
The abhorrent six-members coalition led by Bennett, why aren't they providing benefits to girls in the occupied Galilee by the real Muslim brothers of the abhorrent six-members coalition led by Bennett?
Everyone are flatterers
In the current reality, is the South still ours?!
Do we need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
Certainly the Knesset members will be there!!
What about a public hotel for an ordinary person?
Kudos to investments in the thriving South.
Arad is developing and thriving, and all credit to the mayor who, since the beginning of his tenure, has brought about significant positive changes for the benefit and pride of the city of Arad.
Life of culture, society, education, and more at its finest
Simply an excellent mayor who improved the city!
Well done!
It's interesting how much “protection” fees the resort owner will pay to the Bedouins.
Did they allocate money for “protection” fees?
Wow, sounds good!
Who can afford for themselves: Only El Al, a company with service and security, the best in the world.
When could one fly to Dubai? Something knows????
El Al is a lousy company.
Not socially responsible and not economically either.
In recent weeks, they've been canceling return flights from abroad, do you understand? they sent messages to Israelis and told them the flight is canceled, ruining the entire trip for them, they informed the passengers to leave a message on WhatsApp or Messenger, and they will get back to them, they returned after a one or two days, even three.
The trip was ruined.
Aside from that, is it better to ground planes on the ground instead of conducting return flights to the country and also avoid economic damage?
Are there still sucker passengers flying with El Al?
I’m not flying with them, even for free.
Have they already returned the millions taken from the customers in captivity?
A flight to Geneva round-trip on EasyJet costs 70 euros.
On El Al, one-way costs $560.
I won't buy even for $10 from that religious scammer who controls the company together with his idiotic son, non-stop scammers...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer worthless vouchers.
Because their implementation will come with an added price change.
Those who purchase tickets with El Al put their money on the wing of the plane.
a lousy company.
Tricks from a Low Cost company.
Without suitcases, without seat selection, definitely without taxes, and without food.
Vacation and coronavirus flights...
To all members of disgusting coalition group... Shame on you!
Nature thins out fools!!
