Onion endangered: Three cheetah cubs born in Iran
The world's fastest animal falls victim to brutal hunts, droughts and deadly traffic accidents across the Islamic Republic •
As a result, their numbers dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asian cheetah cubs recently emerged into the world's air in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic condition of the endangered animal in the country following droughts, poachers and fatal traffic accidents.
This is the first birth of a cheetah in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported that the veterinary team, which trusts the Toran National Park in the northern Semnan province, decided on a captive cesarean birth.
It is also noted that fewer than 20 cheetahs have been documented in recent times in seven different counties in the country.
Following the danger of their extinction, the United Nations put into practice a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now, Iran hopes that the new cubs can bring about an increase in the cheetah population in the future.
Last January, Iran's deputy minister for environmental affairs, Hassan Akbari, said the country's cheetah population had dramatically reduced from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to just 12 cheetahs.
“Their situation is dire in the extreme,” Akbari said, noting that cheetahs have fallen victim to droughts in their living areas, hunting and even traffic accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world capable of reaching speeds of about 100 km/h.
Cheetahs can be found in various places across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: we tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify has begun to try its luck in the hardware world as well •
After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the US •
We put our hands on the first device in Israel.
Vision: Make your old vehicles smart
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with older vehicles.
A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently available only to individual experimenters in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was outstanding, as our home vehicle broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.
After two weeks of toying around, I realized how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's system.
And on the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.
From idea to reality
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email box - the possibility of purchasing a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which will turn any old car system into a smart one.
Rumors slowly waned until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors returned to the headlines again after the music service updated with the mode of the vehicle - the same one that we know today from the app - that is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled “Car Thing” last April, its smart system for vehicles.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipments.
So of course, right after the press conference she held, I went onto the site and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
A re-connection to the site will buy me the opportunity to purchase the device with a little surprise - it will not cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the messenger finally knocked my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify's device has greatly impressed me with its build quality.
And a slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a big, bright, sharp touch screen on its front than I expected.
Also, you will find next to the screen a round button and a dial that you can rotate to navigate through the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the photos, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively flimsy profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer that the company allowed the activity of the dial to be changed so that I could control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate using the touch screen.
Perhaps this will be possible in a future version update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters to install it.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after leaving the car.
The Car Thing undoubtedly brings back that feeling with its build form.
All adapters were connected to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
On top of that, along the entire top you can find small buttons, which can be easily configured to play various playlists or podcasts.
By long pressing one of the buttons while hearing, or using a request from the voice assistant, I set up some playlists that I hear frequently and the radio show I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From old car to smart car
After a fairly simple physical setup, I plugged the Car Thing into power.
I was pleasantly surprised by the set-up process.
The instructions were clear, the connection to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through Bluetooth and controls the application like a remote, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.
That means you will still have to connect your smartphone to your car, either via Bluetooth or AUX cable in order to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the application, since like the application on the smartphone, it places emphasis on the photos of albums and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations according to your tastes, the search screen and your personal library.
As already mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or using the manual caliper.
What's more, you can at any given moment call the device's voice assistant by saying “Hey Spotify”.
Using it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
From Sony she quite easily recognized my voice even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.
This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of the article, there is no information about when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for him?
My experience of using the device has been great, which is a positive surprise to me considering it is still in an initial release phase.
Even intensively used on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, occasionally a small stutter is recorded in the interface, but I believe Spotify will handle such bugs with future version updates.
It is evident that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and among the different versions that have leaked online during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to designate it for.
After all, his activity comes down to controlling the application on a smartphone, and not much beyond that.
What is it different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and plugging it in so that the smartphone is closer to us when driving?
That question is reinforced when considering that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and most times will buy the user much more functionality.
Despite all this, as I used the Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
Being able to see the Waze on my smartphone screen and control the music on a completely different screen is one I've come to appreciate over the past two weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company is not currently telling much.
It hasn't even shared how many experimenters for the device it currently operates around the world, and how much it plans to add in its limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is the price that is expected to be $79 (about NIS 255).
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse into a concept Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said there is currently no information about a plan to launch the device in Israel

Have you recruited a Talent for the company?
That way, keep competitors not “snatching” it for you.
The economy is still in a labor market largely dominated by workers, and this is about two times true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the Talents •
Here are some tips to help you keep it in the workplace
.
Despite the increase recorded in the past month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be among the lowest in the world, and in the top 10 among OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6,000 unemployed, according to CBS).
That is, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely controlled by workers and this is true for two times when it comes to the most desirable workers — the Talents.
When it comes to those professionals and managers who are proven centers of knowledge, experience, and ability — the trends in the labor market indicate that the competition for them, the Talents as they are called by employers, is still in full force.
This means for employers is that in the current labor market situation they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after the recruitment of a coveted Talent, since once he enters the company gates, another company will already try to snatch it to it.
That is, the competition for the Talents is so fierce that even after their enfranchisement they will continue to receive a multitude of tempting job offers, with 30% of employees actually leaving only about a month from the receipt of the job and the beginning of the job.
That is why intelligent employers will immediately move from the mobilization phase of the Talent to its preservation phase, when the road begins first and foremost by preparing in advance and taking creativity already in the process of its absorption.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful reception process will make Talent enthusiastic about its new workplace from day one and even look forward to the next.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper reception process that will help preserve the new Talent:
It's no secret - sharing and readiness of the organization |
Share the factors that will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is vital and important for the company and the job, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives where he is expected and understood his worth, will feel welcome and will strive to prove the expectations placed by a son.
Knowledge is Power - Coordination of Expectations |
Already on the first day, make a call to coordinate expectations with the Talent.
Get to know his professional background and see where he sees himself in the future, so you can introduce him to the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him to get there.
We are all people — personal recognition
During the reception days try to get to know the Talent beyond its professional qualities and be interested in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who shows interest in him and allow him to realize and express himself beyond the limits of his position will appreciate it and want to maintain it.
Curiosity advances |
Already in the absorption phase, you can create an attractiveness that will make the Talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily by a discourse of bonuses and benefits, but by exposing it to an exciting field or interesting technology, as these kinds of stimuli for creativity lead to curiosity and growing interest in the workplace.
Also, encourage the Talent to voice his thoughts and opinions to the various projects in the company and make it clear to him that they are important to the organization.

Electrification in the pocket: the cost of not closing the coal stations in June - NIS 1 billion
Report of the Knesset Research and Information Center: The failure to close the coal-fired stations at a date set in June 2022 is estimated to be NIS 1 billion
• IEC: “The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy”
.
The economic cost for not closing the coal-fired stations at a date set in June 2022 is estimated to be NIS 1 billion for 2022, a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center reveals.
According to the report, this cost is embodied in the consumer electricity tariff, which, as we have said, is expected to increase in the coming months due to the cost of coal.
In 2023, an additional excess amount of coal use of about 900,000 tons is expected in 2023, so this will result in an additional cost to the electricity economy for not closing the coal-fired stations, assuming that the price of natural gas remains significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report said that the reduction of about 1 billion shekels in the electricity tariff in 2022 was a 4% reduction in the electricity rate for the household consumer.
That is, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about NIS 1 billion, and the total amount that the consumer could have had is 4%.
It should be noted that in the framework of the electric power reform, among other things, it was decided to create a subsidiary of the IEC, which would build natural gas-powered units designed to replace the 4-1 coal-fired units at the Orot Rabin site.
Following this decision, a government decision was passed in July 2018, which stipulates that the operation of the coal-fired production units 4-1 at the Orot Rabin power plant should be discontinued.
Schedules have been set in the decision, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly, the 4-1 coal production units will also cease to operate at this time.
The IEC said in response: “The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Department of Energy.
In accordance with the Ministry's decisions, a policy has been implemented in Israel for several years of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas.”
Paying the price: everything you need to know ahead of interest rate rises
Constantly decrees: Next week the interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent •
How expensive will the mortgage payment be?
And what is recommended to do? •
All the answers
The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise its interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts' estimates speak of a raise rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.
If interest rates do rise by half a percent, it will already be 1.25%, the highest level for nine years.
This, after for years the interest rate in the economy was close to zero.
The sharp increase in the interest rate makes mortgage repayments hundreds more precious and is drastically burdensome on households.
With the help of Shai Bundle, a mortgage expert, we examined how much more we would pay and what we should do right now.
If the interest rate rises by half a percent - how expensive will the monthly payment on the mortgage be?
In a mortgage of NIS 1.2 million, consisting of a 40% prime interest rate route, the monthly repayment will cost NIS 125.
How expensive was the average mortgage since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, this is a significantly sharper rise.
This is because interest rates in the other routes that make up a mortgage (and not just in the prime route) have also risen - in an index-linked course and in the fixed-interest trajectory.
If the interest rate does rise by half a percent, the cost would amount, according to Bundle's estimate, at 620 shekels in a mortgage of about 1.2 million shekels.
The prime route (40% on this route) will complete a cost of about NIS 280, assuming that there will be an increase of another 0.5% next month.
The index-index-index-index-variable interest rate (26.7% in this route) will complete a cost of about NIS 120.
The fixed-interest rate course - not indexed (33.3% in this route) will be 220 shekels more expensive.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have a mortgage most indexed, Bundle recommends considering recycling for non-indexed routes.
For mortgage takers whose monthly repayments have increased significantly for them and it is difficult for them to meet repayments - he recommends looking at recycling a mortgage and redeploying it for a longer period of time.
This, to reduce payments despite the increase in interest, since it is always better to meet repayments and not be insolvent.
Regarding new mortgage takers - he highly recommends that you familiarize yourself with the different routes and adapt the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
So even in the future when interest rates drop they will be able to do mortgage recycling with a minimum of early repayment fees.
For buyers of apartments from a contractor - Bundle recommends making payments to the contractor and taking out a mortgage now.
It must be taken into account that the “Construction Inputs Index” raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract is signed.
The housing input price index increased 6.6% over the past year.
Against the background of the cost of this measure, the other day, the Banking Superintendency announced that it was considering the creation of a mechanism that would allow the indexation to be included within mortgages, but the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of fuel is expensive - and Israelis will have to pay more than 8 shekels per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be NIS 8.08
At the same time, the reduction of half NIS per liter in the tax on diesel fuel will be extended until the end of 2022
Decade record: The price of gasoline will leap by 36 penny per liter - and will be more than 8 shekels per liter from July 1.
The new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08 and those wishing to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 penny per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022 - according to the Tax Authority.
As already mentioned, the increase in price is due to the continued rise in oil prices, against the background of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the increase in the dollar rate.
If it weren't for the half-shekel discount subsidized by the government since April, the price of gasoline would have passed the all-time high - NIS 8.25 per liter.
The validity of the discount ends at the end of July and the Tax Authority and the Treasury are currently promoting the publication of a decree extending the reduction in the tax on gasoline, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
Also, starting on August 10, a further reduction of another half shekel will be set, so that only from this date the price of a liter of gasoline will decrease by one shekel until November 15, 2022.
This was reported from the Tax Authority.
“We have reached a situation where I can't remember five months in a row of excess in state income.
We started a few months ago with the issue of reducing the tax on diesel.
We have been working for a week on extending in four months the excise tax, gasoline and diesel - instead of half shekel to shekel.
It's good for the industry and the citizen.
If we lower, it will affect inflation, lower production and ease the cost of living.
As finance minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus first of all on that,” Minister Lieberman said at the Hurwitz Conference on Economics and Society of the Israel Democracy Institute.
To date, more than half of the price of gasoline is the taxes charged by the government (excise tax and VAT) - and this is a high rate of taxation compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business expenses, prices for public transport and air travel, transportation costs and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the friendliest city for business
Petah Tikva came second in the Ministry of Economy's Doing Business Rankings •
After them: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon LeZion •
“Corona stressed the importance of local government in developing business”
.
Ashdod is the friendliest city for small and medium-sized businesses.
For the third year in a row, the Local Authorities Doing Business Index found by the Small and Medium Businesses Agency of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranked local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place Rehovot.
They are located in order: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beersheba, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the Local Authorities Index.
This is the fifth time and aims to serve as a working tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on a few parameters examined in each authority, which examine the level of “friendliness” of the Authority for businesses in its field.
The index divides the authorities into three size groups according to the number of inhabitants, since a local authority of up to 50,000 residents is not comparable to a local authority of more than 150,000 residents.
TA has surged this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information and property taxes.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth to 12th place and Netanya dropped from fifth to 13th place.
A drop in the rating does not mean that the Authority's business service has deteriorated, and in many cases it is due to the fact that other authorities' service for businesses has improved more and they have increased in the rankings, while the authority has declined in the ranking has improved its services for businesses less.
Among the most ranked are Petah Tikva, who rose from sixth to second place, and Rehovot, who rose from 12th to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
“Business - Growth Engine”
The ranking shows that Nof Galilee leads local authorities with between 50 and 150,000 residents.
This is followed by Kiryat Motzkin, Mata Binyamin, Modiin-Maccabim-Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
In 28th and last place is Tiberias.
“The measure aims to encourage local authorities to facilitate small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the date of opening the business and throughout its activities with the authorities,” says Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Barbibai.
“Businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of the business product and about 60% of the employed in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses located in it.
The corona underscored the importance of local government and we saw that authorities who acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, became the first governmental interface for them.”
Ran Koithi, director of the Agency for Small and Medium Businesses at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: “Local authorities have a key and fundamental part in the ability of businesses in their fields to thrive and flourish.
In the last two years, in which we are dealing with the coronavirus crisis, authorities have greater weight in helping businesses survive in their field and survive at all.”
2021 By mail: 20 packages per household - and a leap in their weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020 •
The average weight per pack stands at 435 grams - a jump of 36% compared to 2020 •
Busiest month: December, when the average package weight stood at 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail packages arrived in Israel, almost 20 packages on average per household - according to the data from Israel Post that reached Israel Hayom.
The amount of packages arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, in which 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019, in which 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there has been a jump of more than 36% per year in the weight of packages coming from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, a jump of 36% from 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per package has soared by 60% in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The surge in the weight of packages is mainly influenced by two major trends, both from the seller and the buyer side: the largest overseas shopping sites unite items into one shipment and no longer ship each product from the “shopping basket” in separate packaging.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the rapid delivery of shipments, within a few days of ordering, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which buyers want to receive near the purchase.
Also in 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month when the most overseas packages reached the highest weight and the highest number of items was December, with 4.2 million packages with a total weight of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
Black Friday effect
More packages arrived in December than any other month, probably following the November shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.
The largest orders begin to arrive in Israel between one and two weeks after buying.
Study: Most salaried in economy not aware that tax refunds can be obtained
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels.
Have you changed jobs?
Did you go to the LT?
Have you moved from the city to the settlement?
You may be entitled to receive a considerable amount in a simple procedure •
All the details - in the interior
Most tenancies are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to high amounts.
The state comptroller noted in a report two months ago that two million employees are eligible for tax rebates of NIS 3.6 billion, which means you should also check whether you are eligible to receive tax returns.
Many tenancies can receive a high amount, as four out of five tenancies are eligible for tax returns.
In practice, on the other hand, serve several tens of thousands of tenancies per year.
If you think that these funds have gone down the drain anyway, think again: Salaries can apply to the IRS for refunds for back six years.
Tax:On has conducted in-depth research among 4,000 of its customers regarding tax returns during 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their dispersion in terms of population groups and in terms of gender, ages and geography.
The data shows that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis and the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of employees to the NIS, there have been a number of significant changes, centered on a 15% increase in the average return rate for a home of NIS 4,300 per year.
The reason is that the salary is lower than salaries and therefore a gap is created between what the employee paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received in 2020 by a customer of the company was NIS 121,054 for repayments over the last 6 years.
What can I get a tax return for?
One reason to get tax refunds is a change in the workplace.
For 81% of people who changed jobs during the year, a tax return is generated for an average amount of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of women who gave birth and spent on maternity leave over 16 weeks were eligible for reimbursement at an average of NIS 3,538 for that year
Another reason for reimbursement is donations.
100% of people contributing and paying taxes were reimbursed.
Another factor for reimbursement is the failure to register credit points for alimony. 63%
The divorcee did not update a credit point for alimony, so the tax return for each year that has not been updated, such a credit point is NIS 2,616.
Due to unemployment - expenditure for the ILT: 93% of those leaving for the sick or unemployment and who earned over NIS 12,000 received a tax refund of NIS 4021 for the same year.
Other reasons for tax returns are: reimbursement for life insurance payments, life insurance on a mortgage, reimbursement of a qualifying return, reimbursement for losses on securities, failure to register credits to a man for childbirth and distribution of tax returns by geographical place.
- 94% of people who deposited for personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were entitled to a tax refund.
In the examination conducted on every NIS million 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax return for the period is above NIS 20,000 for the entire term of the mortgage
100% of those who move to a qualifying settlement received a tax refund for the year of relocation, since confirmation of residency in a qualifying locality is granted only after 12 months from the date of the resident becoming a qualifying resident, thus in fact the first year full tax is paid.
79% of customers holding securities were eligible for the refund of said years tax.
However, those who hold securities are important to check every year since losses are not rolled out from year to year but only through the filing of a report.
56% of men who have a child do not register credits in the year of birth on the pay slip.
The repayment rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tax:on CEO Tal Carmon: “The coronavirus crisis has caused the salaried public in Israel to become much more active.
He takes an interest, checks and demands what he deserves in refunds from the IRS.
It turns out that the meeting at home, in the IDF or after the dismissal, of hundreds of thousands of Israelis for months on end, made many employees look into what they deserve from the country.
It is important to know that today all procedures for receiving tax returns can be done digitally, easy and simple, without the bureaucracy that has deterred many in the past.”
Employment Market: Fewer Job Applicants, More Wages
Alljobs report in summary 2021: top of demand - Jobs without experience •
The volume of jobs offered increased by 50% •
“Looking for a job, but not storming the market”
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% drop in the number of resumes sent, and an average of only 23 candidates faced each position, compared to 41 applicants in the previous year, according to a report by the UlJobs website in summary 2021, on the coronavirus crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were primarily interested in job openings such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, the jobs without experience led to the top of demand with more than 38 thousand searches - probably following the return of young people with no professional experience to search for immediate employment, at the end of the applicable payments.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35 thousand and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and the conservators had slightly fewer than 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the coronavirus crisis, wages in 2021 rose 2% compared to 2020, and the average salary in Israel was 11,675 gross shekels.
The monthly salary in the software field was an average of NIS 17,915, and in information systems analysis, it was 17,140 shekels.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a wage gap of more than 2,000 shekels: in the center of the country it was 12,500 shekels on average, compared to 10,795 in the north and 10,135 shekels in the south.
From a gender point of view, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained in the type of work and the volume of hours, was maintained and stood at 36%.
Men earned 13,295 shekels, compared to women's wages of NIS 9,740.
Trying to get back to the furrow
On the business side, lateral growth was recorded in almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses craved working hands.
Thus, the supply of jobs increased by 50% and registered a record of more than 40,000 jobs in Oljobs.
A survey conducted by the site among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of whom indicated they intended to increase total recruits, but 72% understood that they would have trouble doing so this year.
The largest supply was for jobs without experience - and such there were more than 58 thousand on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration positions with about 44 thousand jobs in each field, sales and software with 41 thousand jobs each, teaching and education with 24 thousand vacancies, and warehousekeepers still in demand for 19 thousand vacancies.
Einav Boimfeld, Director of Research and Content at OlJobs: “Job seekers are trying to get back into furrow but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs in their eyes.
Also, the prolonged dissociation from the cycle of work makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to earn a living.”

“Not self-evident”: Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrates the fact that “we can live as we want,” gets excited about meeting the audience and making sure to spend time with the kids.
The Weekend and Independence Day of Kobi Shimoni, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
“Weekends are the most important moments in life, for me.
The sanctification and tradition are a very deep root in my soul.
Fridays with me are dedicated to children, Light (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and groceries for kiddush, have lunch and do something fun together, like play football, ride horses or play cars on a sign.
Sometimes you go to the sea, or even just wash the car, but always stop on the way to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store - and there is always another excuse.
When we return home with the multitude of gifts, the smells of cooking welcome us.”
What does your Friday dinner look like?
“I was blessed with the cooked around me.
From my side there is a Persi-Tunisian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughs, music, poetry and joy.
From the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and sharp, with a lot of meat.
When we arrive at my in-in-law, already from the lobby of the building, incredible smells emerge from her apartment.
Most often I do the consecration, together with the children, who know it by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of bloat.”
Do you have a special childhood memory of the weekends?
“As a child, I would wake up on Saturday to the sound of Israeli music on Network C and the pale tracker skits, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in Eretz Israel, usually to the north.
Every remote corner of the country did him pride in his heart.
He died three months ago from a serious illness, and for him consecration and the Sabbath were the holy of holies, mainly in the respect that the whole family should be together.
I recently released a song in his memory called 'Keeps You, 'which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe he was proud of this work, which sanctifies the bond between father and son.”
We will soon mark the 74th Independence Day. As an ardent Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
“Independence Day is a holy day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who gets to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I would already climb trees and tie wires with Israeli flags to the house.
Today my independence days are full of performances, and always meet an insanely happy crowd, who celebrate that we can live the way we want.
It is necessary to maintain that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will also have this option, and remember that nothing here is obvious.”
Her Friday: Estee Zakheim welcomes the Sabbath
“My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones”: the Friday dinner that Asi Zakheim dreams of, and how does she cope with the fact that her husband keeps Shabbat?
Tell about your preparations for sitting down
.
“Preparations begin as early as Thursday night, when I return from a show or workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking such as goulash, roasts and sauces.
On Friday, in the first part of the day, I dedicate the time to myself, to meeting friends and friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I attend rehearsals.
In the summer, Saturdays come in late, and I have plenty of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just a good series.
At Saturday dinner, I often host my mother, Varda, who was celebrating 89, and also friends.”
Can you share more cooking?
“I love shortcuts.
For instance, instead of peeling 10 onions, slicing and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry it.
On my Sabbath table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
Most of the cooking I make, and they, of course, warm up on the braces on Saturday.
Alejandro, my partner, prepares chicken soup, vegetable salad and in winter - the cholent”.
Your husband is a religious person and you are from a secular household.
How does it work?
“Living with Shomer Shabbat is an endless compromise.
Love thy neighbor, in practice.
For family trips he can't go out, so I've often found myself packing up the kids and joining friends' family trips.
In addition, I am also the on-duty driver of the children, the one who brings them back Friday night from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Sabbath, because I don't usually show up on Shabbat and get a kind of 'forced vacation' - and it's good that.”
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
“I would open a large table and order 'My Dead. '
Sometimes I imagine what would have been if my brother Daniel was alive, or if my father, the late Shneur, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
We must have been fighting about football and politics and languish in those of these”.
Do you have a special childhood memory of the weekends?
“We were a warm and united family.
On Friday afternoon, Mom would make a pile of schnitzels, bring chickpeas and pita bread from the market, and burning eggplants for a tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hannah by the hand of Eliyahu, or as she would say, 'Yad Elike', and she would make blintzes.
Since only I didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the little one of the brothers, and worried about me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father in the port of Jaffa, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing.”

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck Get Engaged
Nearly two decades after their love story ends in a breakup, Lopez and Affleck are back in each other's arms.
Lopez broke up with baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
.
His one: Nearly two decades after their first love story ending in a breakup and a year after the high-profile comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic and engaged circle.
The happy news was shared yesterday evening (Friday) Lopez with her fans on her official website onthejlo.com
.
The news of the engagement comes after this week Lopez was documented walking around with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative on her behalf confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
Recall, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and offered Lopez (52) to be his win it was in 2002, and then it was an eye-popping ring with a huge six-carat pink diamond, valued at about $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two separated in 2004, accusing the media of over-obsessing and incessant probing their lives.
Since then Affleck managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as you know, was already married 3 times before, including to singer Marc Anthony, who together became parents of twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she separated in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians speak: “You can't invent what happens to us”
“The chaos is never-ending,” mom Kris Jenner insists on the new series starring the reality show's first family, receiving backing from her daughters and the new producer •
In the article published in the magazine “Shavat” they talk about the big money, the PR grinder, the brand factory and the change Kim wants to make in the world: “I am no longer the one who thinks for hours about what bikini selfie is worth uploading”
It may surprise many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 of the Disney content empire, which among other things also includes the Marvel and “Star Wars” movies, is the Kardashians.
The details of the reality show's first family and social media contract with Disney have not been disclosed, but estimates claim a minimum amount of $100 million was transferred to the family's daughters, who now also function as producers.
In a press meeting with the stars, each of them is accompanied by a whole beauty team that takes care of makeup, hair and fine lines in clothes constantly, the family members insisted, as well as their new and sought-after producer, that this time it is not reality, this time what is obtained on the screen is completely authentic.
“You can't make up what happens to us,” says emphatically the family's matriarch Kris Jenner, “the chaos is never-ending.”
“We're showing how much we've grown since that series that came up in 2007,” Khloe Kardashian says.
“When we started, we were terrified, a lot was happening to us in life and it is impossible to simply delimit everything into a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
A lot of storylines were catalyzed in editing, wrapped in a sugary color film and forgotten on the side.
That's not what life looks like in reality.
Now we're more exposed, turning directly to the camera naturally, not just reality TV but authentic documentary series.”
When confronting them with their new involvement in the production of the series, which actually gives them total control over the content that gets on screen, Chloe claims: “We're involved behind the scenes, seeing footage while editing and giving comments, but not from a place of being defensive but simply giving our opinions about what will make the series better.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel I've gone through emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they're more setting boundaries.”
“I've grown up”
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all her might to change her image, from trashy reality TV to a lawyer with an agenda.
“I've grown up,” she claims, “I'm raising four black children, namely from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends have different futures, hopefully we can heal the crooked system.
This is my motivation.”
“I'm no longer the same Kim who thinks for hours about what bikini selfie is worth uploading,” she insists, “but it hasn't completely disappeared from my life either.
A man must be true to who he really is and take everything with fun.”
About the reasons for firing the producer Ryan Seacrest discovered and their new and very profitable way in the industry, the significance of the move to Disney, the family's oiled PR machine and its impact on the brand's profitability, and more, in the full article published in “You Sat” magazine.

Made in blue and white: Yuval Shamlal is the season's big winner and 16th ninja in the world
The Phenomen climbed Mount Madoriyama in 26 seconds and took the title of “First Israeli Ninja” •
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds but would not hold the Ninja title.
the
There is a winner: Yuval Shamal conquered the Midoriyama, and is the winner of the fourth season of “Ninja Israel” and now holds the world's first and 16th Israeli ninja title.
who has been a participant in the program since its first season then finished in first place, and in the second season lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season he again won and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be the last season.
This evening he climbed Mount Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, having overtaken contenders Yogev Malka and Vichy Kalafon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished second.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season there can be crowned only one ninje who managed to climb the Midoriyama in time.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, as Yuval who is full of the winner of the season climbed the Midoriyama by 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the Ningja world title.
He will be able to re-compete for him next season.
Well, we realized that full of a superhero, harnesses a perfect rock, and “Ninja Israel” is the most important sporting event in the world
.
Two Olympic medallists and a veteran sportscaster sat in the final of a reality TV show and acted as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet
.
Rotem Sela represents for us a feminine ideal so perfect that it is perverse to present it like that on television.
She earns more on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she is too beautiful, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in place, and when necessary - also advocate for her business partner.
She is a mother and also a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads series and reality shows, and serves for young girls an unattainable imitation model.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Sela goes through a perfect screen too, because in the program she directs you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the world of the ninja everyone is larger than life, and the moderators first.
Assi helped, after all, got involved in an affair that was supposed to wipe him off the screen for a period of time, but since he was not an ordinary human, he was rescued from it even before the first batch of advertisements.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niamh Ruskin, who has broadcast European Cup wins and world records, but is excited about a wall wall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the final, two Olympic medalists (Jordan Jarbi and Linoy Ashram) sat alongside him, as if to highlight how rare and high-quality the conditions for entering the superhuman world that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons.
“Ninja Israel” went out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Midoriyama and with a full jubilee who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned a ninja.
There he led an almost insurmountable path, which brought down one by one all the superhuman characters that the show cared to inflate their egos throughout the year.
Want to be Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
Not with us.
This is where you are looking for superheroes.
The emphasis was on seeking a successor to Shamalah, who is known as the “King of Kings and one of a kind,” and other epithets designed to clarify how perfect and disposable he is.
As a result, the difficulty level was raised, the girls who tried to cope in the tracks of the season crashed, and the boys competed among them who has more squares in the stomach and charisma of plywood to get into the shoes of the retiring Shamalah.
They will say that it is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges, but for the vast majority of viewers - medium-sized armchair yams like us - “Ninja Israel” fosters an unattainable sport-achievement model for us.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
As Gil Sesovar moves between punchs to conversations about sanctity
It's strange to see the comedian, Ex “Comedy Store,” host a “Saturday Reception” program on Channel 14, in which he tasted pots and gives a stage mostly to men
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question “What reminds you of the concept of 'preparing for the Sabbath? '”.
Say: Spunja and cleanings, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi Kachon on TV, but the strangest would be if someone suddenly said “Gil Sesovar”.
Because the age of Sesovar in the middle of the spunja and cooking is the most unrelated that television can offer.
And really, “Receiving Saturday,” the new program he hosts on Friday afternoon on Channel 14, is disconnected in spirit from the hour it airs.
Along half of it - Sesovar stands.
He speaks quickly, holds a microphone in his hand even when he tasts dishes, and endeavors to divide the dose between punchs and conversations about sainthood.
In his defense, it will be said that the sparseness of the budget is felt, which is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was still felt in the premiere program, which aired the other day from Benyamin headquarters, is a clear gender divide.
The men sing, play, dance, speak Torah, market restaurants and factories - while the women settled for a small aytem, in which they excitedly told about managing a tailoring.
Happy Women's Day to be so.
Receiving Shabbat with Gil Sesovar, now 14
Protected Housing Association against Ruthie Russo: “Saying 'It tastes like protected housing' hurts our activities”
Chairwoman Yuli Gat sent a letter expressing the union's complaint against an insulting statement, they claimed, of the “next restaurant” judge in one of the trailers for the program.
Ruthie Russo in response: “Glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population.”
The Association of Nursing Homes and Protected Housing in Israel against the “Next Restaurant”: A letter sent by Chairwoman Yuli Gat and reached Israel Today reads: “In a pre-broadcast, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said 'food tastes like protected housing', i.e., food of a closed institution with low-level food.”
“The tone chosen by the judge of the program, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food that the contestant submitted at the moment cancels our longstanding activity to fight against the ignorance that exists in the field, because the protected housing houses operate restaurants for the benefit of tenants with the highest level of chef dishes.”
The service staff and home managers are struggling for the image of protected housing that offers solutions for high-quality housing for the elderly, including the relief of loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living, and more.”
In Israel in recent years, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most serious disease in old age and see communal places as a proven solution to the disease.
“Food is one of the greatest pleasures in life, so we dedicate resources and efforts to serve the finest food to the tenants.
Most of the houses of protected housing are helped by professional chefs in order to build a menu.
We will be happy at any time to invite the judges team to get an impression of the winning dishes served every day to tens of thousands of elders in Israel, as well as on behalf of the chefs and restaurant teams in the protected housing, we will ask for your apology and clarifying.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly.”
Ruthie Russo said in response: “Glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population, which certainly deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, sanity and chefs everywhere, even in sheltered housing.”
“Double Morality: In Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you haven't canceled?”
Nick Kiev responds to criticism
The singer addressed criticism leveled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double moralizing •
The singer said: “The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
”
Nick Kiev cancelled an appearance in Russia earlier this week due to the war and declared that he was “standing by Ukraine and praying that the madness will end soon.”
In doing so, the acclaimed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled performances in the invading country.
But in Kiev's case his cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet told the singer that he was a hypocrite, since in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two performances held in Israel, despite much criticism from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to Israel, Kiev told local media: “In the end, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians.”
The same Ahmet remembered Kiev's statements well for music and against politicization.
The fan even posted on the singer's personal and uncensored website, “The Red Hand Files”, a poignant post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying country, and therefore Palestine's situation is the same as Ukraine.
“Which disturbs me about your message about Ukraine,” Ahmet wrote. “It is that you did not support the Palestinians, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you have described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion Israel is first and foremost the cause responsible for Palestinian suffering.
It makes me very sad, since you represent a double morality here,” the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story does not end here, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he stressed that “Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is a previous unprovoked assault by one country in its neighbour, hoping to change the security order of the whole of Europe.
The second situation is complex friction between two peoples.
Although the conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel very sympathetic to all of these communities - no matter where they are and who it is.”
Kiev added that while he does not want to elaborate on his views regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supports the Palestinians, noting that in the past 20 years many have attended fund-raisers for them.
“But this is not a time for arguments, Ahmet,” the singer clarified, “this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently underway on their land a catastrophe.
I have a great following in Russia, and I know that many Russians are vehemently opposed to the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them, I would.
In light of the decline in morbidity: The Corona Projector will return to run the Ziv Hospital
Prof. Salman Zarqa was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the coronavirus treatment policy in the third wave and the fourth wave •
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will simultaneously continue in his role as a projector.
Prof. Zarqa: “Glad that the Omicron wave continues to wane, and it is still our duty to prepare for another wave”
.
Amid the decline in coronavirus morbidity, the coronavirus projector, Prof. Salman Zarqa, will return to run Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will simultaneously continue in his role as a projector.
“I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the wave of omicron continues to fade and that we have got our normal way of life back,” Prof. Zarqa said, adding: “It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a derivative of the fact that the virus is still here, in Israel and around the world.”
Prof. Zarqa was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the coronavirus treatment policy in the third wave and fourth wave.
From May 1, Israel returned to a state of “between waves”, which includes reducing most of the coronavirus values, while maintaining capabilities to conduct tiling tests and investigations, which will be the basis for action in case a new variant is discovered.
Latent morbidity
In the report of the National Corona Campaign Knowledge and Information Center, released this morning, noted that “there is a decrease in the average of new validated persons to below two thousand per day, in the weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized and hospitalized in serious condition.”
However, they stressed that “there is a latent morbidity of significant volumes and in practice the number of those infected is much higher.
The number of institutional examinations carried out in the community (without weighting the tests of the overseas, MY) is low, and stands at less than 20,000 tests on average weekly alone.
The low volume of tests makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends.”
State Auditor's report: The actual budget for most years of the Drug Basket Committee operation - smaller than the recommended budget
According to the report by Netanyahu Engelman, for more than 20 years of the basket's activity, the Ministry of Health has not supervised the activities of the committee.
The report also states that the conference protocols are published significantly late, if at all •
The auditor also recommends increasing transparency of subcommittee activity — and updating bin work procedures •
Another flaw found concerns that since the commission began operations, the Ministry of Health has not asked the HMO for reports on the extent of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket — which would have made it possible to analyze and review the budget given to them.
The Pharmaceutical Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the Commission decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the HMO — but a new report by the State Auditor published Tuesday warns that this has been operating for more than 20 years without control reports on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Board monitoring and reviewing its activities.
Israel Hayom correspondent Ran Reznik adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing exposures in Israel Today about the drug basket blunders.
According to the report by Netanyahu Engelman, he recommends “carrying out in the process of expanding the basket corrections and improvements, which will result in a more qualitative extraction of the health care basket budget that the public is entitled to.”
Throughout the years of the existence of the drug basket supplement mechanism, in 2021-1998, NIS eight billion drugs were added to the state budget — with the supplement fluctuating annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add 800 new drugs and technologies to the healthcare portfolio, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated to expand the basket was smaller than the volume of requests.
In most years of committee operation (90% of the time), the amount of budgetary increment was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.
The auditor notes that it is necessary to review and regulate the height of the annual supplement with the aim of enabling certainty and long-term planning.
Engelmann further noted that “the model of transparency in the basket work is lacking.”
Thus, for example, the procedure for the work of the basket committee states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the protocols are published with a delay of 160-109 days, when sometimes the protocols of the final meetings are not published at all.
“The delay in the publication of the protocols impairs the transparency of the decisions; due to this, the ability of the proposal responders — patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies — to submit repeated requests as soon as possible and relevant, having produced lessons from rejecting their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and revised their proposals, and reevaluated the feasibility of receiving them in the next round,” the auditor noted in the report.
“The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules set out in the procedure.”
Out of thousands of submissions -- only one economic comment was submitted
Another criticism of Engelmann concerns the preliminary procedure of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The auditor found that about half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for rejection.
Another impairment concerns the activities of the Pharmaceutical Basket Subcommittee which is closed to the media and the public, and in which patient numbers and costs of medicines are discussed.
The auditor recommends attaching a public representative or examining the possibility of making public the discussions without confidential commercial details.
The procedure by which the Health Services Basket Committee operates, it is determined that “an economic assessment must be submitted” to the request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions -- and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, for the Basket Committee hearings for 2021-2019, applications were submitted to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report revealed that no economic estimates were attached to the requests, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing the damage of diseases derived from obesity or the ability to avoid gastric shortening surgery.
It also suggests that the decisions of the Pharmaceutical Basket Committee were inconsistent with the objectives and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparedness for the treatment of chronic diseases in 2019 as objectives, but in the framework of decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The auditor also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the health funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health (the “third supplement”) are included in the basket of medicines.
This is when the legal framework for this step is regulated only retrospectively.
Over the past six years, NIS 74 million of the drug supplement has been used for these services.
Engelmann recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work procedures and also determine whether a separate monetary supplement is needed for these services.
About a third of new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as “drugs at no added cost,” the use of which does not cost patients' coffers an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The auditor suggests considering the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different, shortened course, so that the drug basket can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.
The use of particularly expensive drugs is not monitored.
The audit also shows that since the work of the Basket Committee began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the HMO to report and has not supervised the scope of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the Ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports have been published relating to 2009-2006, and these have also been published considerably late (the latter was published this year and dealt with the exploitation of the budget in 2009-2007).
“The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, the irrelevance of the conclusions that arise from testing after such a long period of time, to the subcommittee's underpricing, and to make decisions based on non-final findings,” the report said.
Also, the Ministry also does not audit and monitor the uses of particularly expensive drugs and has not carried out the production of lessons.
These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the supplement to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2021-2016).
On this, the auditor wrote: “It is recommended that the Ministry of Health carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the scope of their use compared to the estimates.
Controls and analysis will allow systemic conclusions to be drawn on the working process of the Hessl Committee and the Subcommittee, and on how estimates are prepared when pricing drugs and technologies and their improved technologies.”
“Shocking and unfathomable”: heated discussion in the Health Committee on the poisoning at Dafne House
The indicators of the first deceased Jose were normal ten minutes before her death •
Chairman of the committee, MK Silman: “If people cared about the kitchen being like home, it wouldn't look like that.”
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old Jose from the Beit Dafna residence in Holon died of food poisoning, medical indicators were taken to her that were normal, she claimed Tuesday at a hearing in the Health Committee's management of the residence.
“We have night caregivers who check in during the night and there is a nurse who does rounds.
There have been a number of reports of diarrhea cases and the same occupant basically the last time she was taken from gauges was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was followed up like the over-dakers with diarrhea.
She's a nursing patient, we went to get a manoch to assist with her transfer and then the same tenant didn't respond.
We started CPR and called the nurse of the clinic,” the daycare manager described what took place last Sunday morning at the residence.
This is an incident in which three occupants died, six were hospitalized, and a total of about a quarter of the residents of the residence (33 out of 131) suffered a setback to host eating contaminated goulash meat.
The director of the residence said the remarks against the background of claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the attending parties.
Dr. Naama Nous in charge of Epidemiology Health Bureau in Tel Aviv noted that “We cannot conclusively determine what the three Yadyars disposed of.
Only blood tests were taken from them.”
It was also discussed that even from the residents admitted to the hospital, it was no longer possible to have a stool sample because he was not deprived and therefore the cause of death and morbidity could not be determined with certainty.
An engineer from the Ministry of Health also noted that “the Ministry of Health checks sanitary conditions in the kitchens of institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs or to request a renewal of a license.”
In the Ministry of Social Affairs, they admitted that a committee of inquiry into this case and a previous case of Hacosim mishap that took place three months ago at the Bnei Zion institution in Sharon.
The chair of the health committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the hearing: “If people there cared about the kitchen being like home, it wouldn't look like that.
The welfare dorm rooms need more.
They are health-sensitive and need careful supervision and care.
It's shocking and unimaginable what was going on there.
The horrific findings discovered are even after they knew the Department of Health was coming to check.
Where is the oversight and responsibility of the offices?
How in such a discussion are ministers and the CEOs not present to give an explanation of what is going on here?”
Yigal Nachatomi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who runs the residence and even ran the residence himself, said, “Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire array rise up with only one goal: to do good for people.
The people who passed away are people I personally cared for.
One of the occupants I put to sleep on my hands.
It's a very big event for us.”
Smadar Una, a former occupant of the same age residence, snapped at him, saying that “enough with the lies and beautiful words.
I was there.”
Gali Barmy, representative of parents in Akim Israel: “We have complained about the food in the past and have not received the criticism.”
Oren Hellman, the founder of Equal Chance for Integration of People with Disabilities protested that the names of the deceased hasim were not published: “They don't know their names at all.
Are they worth less?
We underestimate the lives of our children.”
Suspected omission in Wolfson: The surgeon caused a rupture of the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Firas Abu Akar as director of the breast surgery unit at the hospital •
The chairman of the Board of Physicians complained that the director, Dr. Engel, had been warned before his appointment.
The hospital: “He is appreciated and experienced”
First publication: A horrific mistake occurred at the Wolfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during an operation the doctor made a tear in the patient's heart, which led to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was conducted on April 19.
It was the first surgery performed by Dr. Firas Abu Akr at the hospital, after being appointed director of the breast surgery unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large rupture of the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.
Except the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised difficult questions when it came to hospital management.
The director of the oncology institute and chairman of the doctors' committee, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation of the affair in a letter he delivered to the hospital director, Dr. Anat Engel.
The letter made extremely serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, after the unit's previous director, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to the Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
Huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient had been lucid, functioning and had been treated by him for the past four years.
Recently, he had a spread of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid was detected inside the pericardium, inside which the heart muscle is located.
Also, surgeon Dr. Abu Akr, was impressed that he could perform the operation.
According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred in the surgery, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of cardiac and chest surgery at Wolfson, who was at the time in a child's surgery in the next room, “was called startle to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart.”
According to him, the heart was drained of blood, blood pressures were zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
On top of that, Dr. Brenner recounted that Dr. Dekel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar was not professionally and personally suited to run a thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and even being the direct director of the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without sharing it and accepted Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
It further noted: “This is an uncomplicated procedure, lasting a few minutes,” adding: “It is not possible not to address the inadequate process of accepting Dr Abu Akar for the position.
The question arises whether there is a direct responsibility of Engel for the failure of the operation and the patient's death.”
Experienced Surgeon
Information and allegations from other senior doctors have been raised to Israel Today that reinforce the questions raised in the affair by Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, a surgical director at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint, writing that Dr. Abu Akr was “one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon.”
He added that he was chosen in the right bid and Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements about his desire to “break away” from the chest unit.
Another commented: “I wasn't privy to the procedure either, and I may have been supposed to be him.
Dr. Shamunov wrote that Dr. Firas Abu Akr began working on April 10 and was entitled to 100 days of grace. “All the hospital doctors were impressed by his professionalism and motivation and willingness to work.
He has already carried out dozens of cases of similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it ended regrettably.
Wolfson Hospital said in response: “We participate in the family's grief.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The thoracic surgeon mentioned in the article is a highly regarded surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in the tender to manage a thoracic surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
“According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, his words quoted are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very serious condition.
The hospital is reviewing the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case.”

About Prof. Marvin Shapira
The encounter that opened my eyes - and changed my life
If I hadn't met Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained an expert doctor in internal medicine.
It was he who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to engage in it.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, then island in the 1980s.
For a moment I did not think that I would leave the inner, since I loved the treatment of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, both internally, and basically in every area.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
All along, I loved his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the bottom of the problem.
Discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor in all the capillaries of his soul, who loved the sick and taught me not to take things for granted and to thoroughly examine everything.
He was a real and honest person, devoid of ego, qualities that I loved very much in him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me most, I was going to choose my father, Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go to medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.
Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors still use today - for example “Tisho iz de Ishio”, that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ allows you to know what drugs are worth giving; or “Wen Yo Hughes it, Yo Luz Itt,” intended to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked in Hadassah and the father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven I cried.
He was something - a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his serious illness.
He was one of the first doctors on staff to treat epidemics, and is sorely lacking during this time.
Had he been with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted him, and sure he would have been one of the leaders of the pandemic treatment team.

About the late Prof. Shaul Suknik
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
.
I met Prof. Shaul Suknik for the first time when I was a student in the fourth year of medical school, and came to a rotation in internal medicine in the 4th internal department, which he ran.
Later, I also returned to the department in a sixth year rotation, and the medical school thesis I did under his direction, writing a computer simulation about a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).
Saul influenced every significant intersection of my professional life over 20 years, and was the most significant man in shaping my figure as a physician; not only professionally, but also — especially — personally and humanely.
During the internship, I debated family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about the choice of internship.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him at Soroka.
During the internship, he provided me with constant guidance, on a variety of avenues - in scientific writing (sorry Saul, I wasn't persevered enough), in contact with patients, in working in a multi-professional team — an area in which the department excelled — and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I recognize in me, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from the world.
When I finished the internship and was debating whether to travel for a period of continuing education abroad, Shaul pushed and oriented me, and assisted me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.
The continuing education period was a very important time for my professional development, and without Saul's support and push, I'm not sure it would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the management of the hospital, Saul was again the one who supported and assisted.
Later we have together complex periods in the Division of Internal Medicine.
Saul knew how to wonderfully integrate the teacher, manager, friend and team partner, without his different roles interfering with each other.
I strive to be as successful as him in this special combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns who are now throughout the medical system in Israel, commemorating their excellent work and work.
I am honored to be appointed with this bunch.

Dr. Efrat Brun-Herlev, Director of the Schneider Center for Pediatrics |
About Dr. Tommy Schinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Schinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at the Schneider Pediatrics Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that, he taught me to think.
The obvious I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, and are now between life and death.
The obvious is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who did not imagine getting into these complex situations in an intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds weird, but that's the obvious one.
But I learned even more significant and profound things from him.
Looking back, because I am a doctor who is a director and a director who is a doctor, it is clear to me today the connection between the worlds; the education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen carefully to many things: listen to children, listen to the monitor, listen to the nurse-caregivers, young and adult caregiver teams alike, and listen to parents.
All this needs to be done not only in order to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in the treatment of children are present everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and discourse inspire deeper understanding, both on the part of the attending team and on the part of patients and their families.
My understanding today as an administrator is that these insights are also true in looking at an entire system.
The deeper and more rigorous understanding takes place, which incorporates all the attending entities into the discourse, the more precise the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and especially early enough to prevent future damage, immediate or distant.
That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspiring figure to me.
He's a man who taught me a ton of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, listen - then apply.

Medical malpractice in the different stages of childbirth
In order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the dereliction, that the damage was caused by the same dereliction
Childbirth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in the life of a family.
Unfortunately, however, births sometimes end with serious damage caused to the mother or newborn as a result of the dereliction of medical staff.
In cases where the birth ended in physical harm, to the newborn or the mother, there is room to examine the events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in the field of medical malpractice will examine whether there have been defects in the conduct of the medical team during the different stages of birth that have caused the damage and, as he deems appropriate, will consult a medical specialist in the field of relontic.
It should be emphasized that not every error in treatment on the part of the medical staff arises to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.
When then is it negligence?
When the doctor's mistake was due to ineptitude or deviated from the reasonable level of caution, and ineptitude and deviation from the acceptable level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not been so.
In this article, we will look at the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications can occur in each of the stages and when they arise to malpractice.
Stage of contractions
The contractions phase lasts an average of 8—14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (in order to allow the passage of the fetus at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most cases of medical malpractice in the labor phase deal with the failure to identify fetal distress in preparation for birth, which has caused damage to the newborn, sometimes manifested by cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy may be caused by non-detection or delay in identifying prenatal asexudation, which manifests itself in a failure to supply oxygen to the fetal brain tissue.
As a rule, monitoring the condition of the mother and correctly deciphering the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early detection of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical team to act quickly and extract the newborn before being irreversibly affected.
Cases in which the medical staff ignores signs that indicate that the fetus has a lack of oxygen or that the staff misinterprets data on the face and in particular the fetal monitor or reacts late to the distress expressed in the monitor may constitute dereliction.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by umbilical cord prolapse as well as a result of uterine rupture that was not detected in a timely manner.
Even in these difficult events, it is worth finding out whether the medical staff acted properly.
For example, attorney Anna Rafe Lignese, of Caspi Srour & Co. firm, which specializes in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her office handled the prosecution of a child injured during his birth after the midwife had immobilized the amniotic sac when the fetal head was too high, thus leading to umbilical cord prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury to the fetal head) and being born with injury to the fetal brain (as a result of the fetal head's pressure on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury to the fetal head) and being born with injury to the fetal brain (as a result of the fetal head's pressure on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury Severe neurologic.
In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a claim due to the gross medical negligence of a maternity ward staff at a large hospital who, during delivery, did not detect clear signs that required a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy.
The fetus that was ejected through the rupture of its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was at death's door.
Due to severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child was caused by a complex neurological disability.
We emphasize that in order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to dereliction, that there is a causal link between the dereliction of the medical staff that resulted in the failure to identify the asphyxia and the damage caused to the newborn, that is, that the damage was caused due to said negligence and not for any other reason or cause.
Examination of the causal relationship will be carried out through the examination of medical measures that, according to the medical literature, only in the existence of which there is a causal relationship between the aseptic and the brain injury.
Among other things, the indicators of the level of acidity in the fetus's blood, its apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic impairment, etc.
Passing of the fetus
The phase of active birth
The phase of active delivery begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 cm and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Delay in childbirth and avoidance of performing a cesarean section
In some cases, dysfunctional childbirth develops, i.e., lack of progression of the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to avoid various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in childbirth.
“There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner can cause irreparable harm to the fetus,” Attorney Reiff-Ligenza explained to us.
“For example, we conducted a malpractice claim of birth death caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.
Contrary to any recognized medical practice, medical personnel were not educated to identify fetal distress and perform a caesarean section despite the unusually slow progression of childbirth.
The delay in carrying out the operation caused a lot of systemic damage to the birth which finally led to her death near her birth.”
Negligence in vacuum birth
In situations where the mother or fetus is present with a significant danger that requires a particularly rapid termination of childbirth, a vacuum birth is sometimes carried out (empty cohort).
In this process, a vacuum “dome” is attached to the head of the fetus and force-pull the fetus out.
Naturally, this action involves dangers and can cause harm to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great care, accuracy and skill.
In these events, medical malpractice may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not follow the mandatory guidelines and performs the operation despite the presence of a contraindication, such as when the head of the fetus is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for longer than permitted or when despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more than the allowed number of attempts.
In those cases if the careless vacuum operation has caused a newborn harm — among other things, it can cause cranial damage and bleeding that can cause brain damage to develop — there is room for filing a tortious claim.
Paralysis named after ERB
Paralysis named after Erb, here is a congenital nerve injury to the brachial plexus (nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetrical team.
The injury is manifested by weakness of the muscles of the hand and can reach up to complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of 'shoulder ruffle' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus's shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.
When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the evaluation of the weight of the fetus indicated that it was a macrosomous fetus, that is, that it is expected to be born with a weight greater than 4.5 kilograms and according to the guidelines it is better to deliver the mother by caesarean section.
When the newborn's weight is over 4 kilograms, consider caesarean section in view of the risk factors including gestational diabetes and the lengthening of the second stage of birth.
In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal fetal weight assessment or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with vaginal delivery and the risk of shoulder injury and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is malpractice.
Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that “the risk that during childbirth shoulder stenosis will occur is foreseeable to one degree or another of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is concern about its occurrence is to conduct a cesarean section.”
Placental exit phase
Separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the newborn leaves and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process lasts in most cases up to half an hour from the moment the baby is left and, for many times, occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the placenta is out, the medical team will check whether it has come out intact or whether there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.
Within this stage, complications may occur that can cause serious damage to the mother.
One of the known complications due to the presence of placental residues in the uterus is called “Asherman's syndrome”, scarring of the uterine wall results in inflammation caused by the presence of placental residues in the uterus, a phenomenon that affects the endometrium in a way that does not allow the implantation of pregnancy.
Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not recognize that placental residues remained or did not take all measures to prevent injury to the endometrium despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, it may be medical negligence, and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
Death of the mother
The death of a newborn during childbirth is a fairly rare euro.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or react late to such bleeding.
“For example... “, Attorney Reiff-Lignza told us, “our office filed a lawsuit regarding the death of the birth, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the mother's alarming vital signs, extended hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the comorbidities from which she suffered.”
“In another case... “, Adv. Reiff-Lignese said, “Our firm represented the relatives of a girl who died after the birth of twins due to bleeding whose origin was in the caesarean section that was not properly sutured.
In the same case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after surgery, but the medical team did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, responding late only after her body systems began to collapse, which resulted in her passing.”
Loss of uterus
In severe cases, birth medical malpractice can lead to hysterectomy, says attorney Rafe Lingze: “Our firm conducted a lawsuit against a hospital underlying hysterectomy due to postpartum medical malpractice.
In the same case, the mother, a young woman of 31 years old, lost her mercy due to lack of proper care in the massive bleeding observed by the medical team after birth and despite this, the actions that could have prevented the damage were not taken in time.”
What are the compensations that are terminated in claims for medical malpractice at birth?
Newborn compensation for injury due to malpractice at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being provided for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, salary and pension losses to the victim and even his parents, and other damage components.
The remit compensation to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average salary in the economy.
The compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adjusting housing to the needs of the baby, mobility and more.
“The amount of compensation is determined in each case individually and according to its circumstances,” says Adv. Reiff-Lignese, adding that “today most of the claims on the grounds of medical malpractice end with a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in conducting the procedure,” but the attorney added, saying that “there are cases in which the procedure is terminated only in a judgment, so if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example “As part of a lawsuit conducted by our office, the District Court ruled that a minor caused cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation in excess of ten million shekels.”
concluding
Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.
In these cases, a proper forensic examination of the events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney trained in managing claims on grounds of medical malpractice, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of the eye disease keratoconus in the south
A study revealed that there is a link between the development of the disease and close marriage •
The highest prevalence was found in the Bedouin sector •
Expert: “It is possible that in every sector with many weddings between cousins, we will find a high incidence of disease.”
Keratoconus is a hereditary eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and to find correct solutions to prevent the condition from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted that help to understand how the disease develops, and innovative therapies have been developed.
The new studies give research to the suspicion of the eye disease Keratoconus being a genetic disease.
Recent research, which dealt with transforming the shape of the cornea from a dome to a cone, revealed that the cause of the cornea's disease and weakness and its distortion of shape is associated with an enzymatic imbalance, following which free radicals can damage the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The source of that lack of enzymes is genetic, a fact that reinforces the hypothesis that keratocanus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariela Gordon-Shag, head of the Department of Optometry Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, “In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of keratoconus was found of 3.2%.
The highest incidence was in students from the Bedouin sector — 20% were with keratoconus, but there was a small relative sample.”
The researcher added that it was an unsurprising finding: “There is a large prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies we found that close marriage is a risk factor for keratoconus disease.
Thus in any sector with a lot of weddings between cousins, we may find a high incidence.”
In this regard, it should be noted that this is an important finding given the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where a family story of keratoconus disease appears, all family members should approach an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.
According to Arza Fruchter, B.Sc clinical optometrist, “There is a tenfold recourse to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, mainly from the southern region, compared to the center.”
“Over the past decade, I have noticed that most patients have been evacuated from the periphery, especially from the Beersheba region.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriages within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of proper handling of the problem.”
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or late teens (ages 16-15 or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, in parallel with an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients indicate distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and progressively over years.
However, the disease may also develop at a rapid rate and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many of the patients even indicate increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the Gaza action - the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: “Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel”
Mahmoud Khair ad-Din from the village of Khorfish is a lieutenant colonel killed in an operation in Khan Yunis •
Head of MN: “Publicity deserves him, his family and his children” •
Later, the possibility of publishing the photo of Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno of a patrol of the General Staff will be examined
About three and a half years after the operation that entangled Khan Yunis, the IDF today permits to publish that the person killed in action, Lt. Col. M, is Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair ad-Din from the village of Khorfish in the north.
The 41-year-old was in Nuplu.
Colonel Bennett said after the publication: “It has been three and a half years since the late Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hir al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Younis, and only now are we allowed to find out his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the country.
“The late Mahmoud was a fighter in a paratrooper cruiser and later grew in the ranks of the army to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's Special Operations Division.
Hero of Israel who was posthumously decorated with the Chief of Staff.”
He added: “I eulogize him at his funeral and now there is a right for the people of Israel to know him, his name and the face of the hero of Israel, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hir al-Din, openly.
The environment bore her eyes to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned the publication of his name for security considerations, and today, after a discussion conducted by the head of the Intelligence Directorate, Gen. Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censors, and with the consent of his family members, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair ad-Din, a hero of Israel, was born on 28 December 1977 in the village of Khorafish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmad and a nun, with seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahad and the father of two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter, and commander in the Special Operations Division in the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Khair ad-Din was a social leader, and the surroundings bore its eyes to him.
Until ninth grade, he attended school in Kfar Chorfisch, and then moved to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he enlisted in a paratrooper cruiser, and in 2000 graduated from the Officer School.
In 2002, he was located by the Special Operations Directorate in the Maj. and moved to serve in it.
While in his service, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Administration and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002, he met his wife, Nahed, and in 2004 they married.
Their first child was born in 2009, a year during which he founded an association with his friends that worked to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he was a member of the “After Me” association and started mentoring a group in the village of Chorfisch, after making sure that the association began operating in the Druze villages to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
The head of the AMN, Gen. Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: “It is time we turn on the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair ad-Din, the hero of Israel.
We finished work and concluded that there was no security impediment to publish his name and picture.
He also deserves it, his family and his children,” he noted.
“Exceptional Educator and Leader”
“Thanks to many promotions, he is nothing short of a hero to me,” said Gen. Haliva.
“He has a significant contribution, which has courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
It is appropriate that he gets the right place for him.”
And he added: “I didn't know him personally, but he was an educationist, an educator and an extraordinary leader - not only on the operational side, but in my values.”
Gen. Haliwa said he would also examine whether to publish the picture of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno of the General Staff, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not declassified.
The action in Khan Yunis occurred on 11 November 2018.
The operation was the culmination of long months of careful preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
The command squad of the operation sat the then Chief of Staff, General Gadi Eizenkot, the then head of the MCO, Gen. Tamir Hayman and the then head of the IDF, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been declassified, and the IDF stressed that it was an invaluable intelligence operation.
But in the Arab media, in retrospect, contact equipment that, according to the Palestinians, had been left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was aimed at imbuing listening devices.
According to publications, on the day of the incident, the force drove two vehicles.
The fighters were detained at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas members, and something in their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
Activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The on-field interrogation took about 45 minutes, during which time it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized it was in a troubled situation, Lt. Col. Khair ad-Din managed to distract Hamas members, and in that split second, the force commander, Lt. Col. A, managed to open fire.
Three Hamas men were killed from the fire, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair ad-Din.
Ten months after the serious incident, the Chief of Staff, Chief of Staff, Aviv Khawkari, decided to accept the recommendation of the IDF Committee and grant a Chief of Staff to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip, including Lt. Col. Khayr ad-Din.
The commander of the fighter force and another fighter in the team also received a Salash.
The army statement said that Lt. Col. M. received the IDF for “his activities in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, for the protection of his comrades.
Later, he acted with initiative and pursuit of contact, took a forward role in the takeover of the enemy and acted resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider switching from tweezer operations to extensive operation
Israel needs to ask itself, once again, if it is wrong to change policy in the face of the Jenin sector •
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would light up and set fire to the West Bank in its wake, but the Jenin gunmen may leave it no choice.
The stormy weekend shows that even though Ramadan is behind us, the terrain is still more explosive than ever.
It will take great efforts and common sense to peacefully cross the two upcoming mention dates: Nakba Day, Sunday, and Jerusalem Day, which will be marked in two weeks.
Quite a few factors will stand by in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
Heads, as ever, are the terrorist elements, who are concentrating a special effort on trying to preserve the violent atmosphere of the past few weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the late YM fighter, Maj. Gen. Noam Raz, was killed the day before yesterday.
Fighters who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they did not remember such a scale of gunfire and violence — evidence not only of the tremendous amount of MIS in the field, but also of the willingness to use it.
This requires Israel to ask itself, again, whether it is wrong to change policy in the face of the Jenin sector, and to move from small, intelligence-based tweezers operations to a widespread, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would light up and set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena; even now, the security system prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid incendiary, but the Jenin gunmen may leave it no choice.
Generate the lessons for the events of the future.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims to have deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shirin Abu Aqla.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and for those who are present at the scene.
The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocents as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of fighters.
This indicates high morality, but it also has operational and intelligence value: a captured terrorist alive — as happened yesterday in Jenin — is an excellent source of information about the MAC, terrorist attacks and other terrorists; it is information that can usually not be obtained in any other way, and by which the subsequent attacks can be thwarted.
The IDF was correct when the other day published its interim investigation into the death of Abu Aqla, clarifying that it was not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the affair.
Nothing seems to convince the convinced anyway: the world has already hurried to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terrorism - the original grounds on which the IDF constantly operates in Jenin.
As ever, the nature of such stories perish.
World public opinion is busy with its own and moving on, certainly as Ukraine continues to rage a war many times more intense.
Therefore, it is a pity that Israel insisted on giving Abu Aqla's death affair more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu-Aqla's family did not meet the early summits, a little more fortitude should have been expected from the policemen who accompanied the funeral journey, and certainly be less moved by the Palestinian flags.
Responsibility requires: to act to calm the situation.
Good did the Minister of Internal Security and the Police Commissioner who ordered an investigation into the incident.
It seems that it lacks sufficient preparation and clear instructions, but disturbing is the fact that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
In the attack in Dizengoff, the police also failed to manage the event, the isolation of the scene and the handling of the media.
The Investigative Committee will do well if it is not only satisfied with analyzing the conduct of the police officers at the funeral itself, but also with deriving lessons and conclusions that will allow more successful handling of similar events in the future.
Along with the internal treatment of the police, it also pledges to address the conduct of elected officials who have lost way and direction.
In the Knesset, there are now several members who are a danger to democracy.
They are on the left and right, and take advantage of their immunity not to challenge the country, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kasif is the latest example of this; if no steps are taken towards him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the State will implicitly encourage the next elected official to further officer his actions.
Such moves, tantamount to a defensive democracy, are essential in the explosivesity of this period, with elements in the background that seek to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with common sense in his head is expected to rise above all these, and act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel could quickly slide into escalation in the face of enemies from the outside, and worse, against opponents from home.
Senior police official: “Government policy and setting targets are required here”
Although the Israeli police have launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegals, but the road is still long.
There is not a single factor in the State of Israel today that is perfecting this whole issue.”
“If you want to address the phenomenon of illegals, government policy is required, and from which objectives, tasks and responsibilities must be derived.
Today, there is not a single factor in the State of Israel that is perfecting this whole issue,” a senior police official tells Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, prior to the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon was manifested by about 20 to 30 thousand IAEA who enter daily through the breaches of the fence.
In addition, between 100 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel daily through 34 supervised crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each industry is limited by a quota set by the political echelon depending on the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
Permits are issued by the IDF through the Directorate of Coordination and Liaison.
In light of this, the NIS is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to the attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians who have been banned because they do not meet the permitted permit quota.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the terrorist attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and El'ad were indeed considered to be Shaha'ites, but were not supervised, because they had not previously undergone any criminal offense that required the security agencies to monitor their movements.
“Therefore, their entry through the breaches in the fence is meaningless,” says a senior security official. “Those who want to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the monitored crossings, and there have been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of the number of warning attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to detect illegals.
By the end of the week, some 16,000 PAVs had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases were opened for them, and about 200 were jailed.
According to the policy of police prosecution, proceedings against illegal staying are carried out only towards prone criminals or persons who repeat the act repeatedly (recidivists).
An illegal stayman detained for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes this is repeated for the second time, but only the third time he was arrested, imprisoned and indicted for illegal stay.
According to the law, if an illegal stay is caught within about 50 to 100 meters of any party of the segregation gender, the treatment of it is carried out by the military prosecution.
Data reached by Israel Hayom shows that in 2021 40,010 illegals, passengers and interlopers were treated by the police.
7,405 illegals were arrested and 19,533 a criminal case was opened.
The number of employers, disenchanters and linesmen treated by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
“The foundations of the Shabab phenomenon do not depend on the police, neither the IDF, nor Israeli society, nor Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors,” says a senior law enforcement official.
“To address the phenomenon, they have to sterilize their motivation to go to work in Israel, and on the Israeli side, they must be charged a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the issue claim that the failure to collect the price is due, among other things, to the lack of places of confinement and the fact that arrests are carried out only when there are related offenses or that it is a recidivist.
Legal officials claim that the decision to collect a price from the NIS only as of his third arrest was made, among other things, because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests that are carried out every day.
Anyone who also looks at punishment will find that it is not daunting.”
There is a great complexity
The NIS,” says a police official, “is a complex person.”
He could be the father of a family who entered Israel to work to earn a few shekels and return.
This is the basic platform, and on which there are a lot of types of PAVs who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks.”
The NIS can be chalked or minor.
In the past, illegal 16-year-olds have been caught by police and even 8- and 10-year-olds are sent by their parents to road junctions, to earn a few shekels daily from drivers.
“It also makes the matter complex, because in cases like this we have to bring the parents in and bring charges against them for neglect,” says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced building work.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed IAEA in garbage disposal, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 aisles, there are about 18 central passages.
There are crossings of vehicles and goods, there are crossings that pass through them only people and there are crossings that are both and.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Transitions Authority.
The Shabbals usually drive private drivers into the country, as this is easy money.
“There are those who do this for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is the drive of PAVs,” says a senior police official, “usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can reach 100 shekels to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies do not deal with this, because if the company is caught, it will be allowed to close.”
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting the NIS can be considered an offense.
“A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at orderly points and at regular times, including an orderly booking, does not break the law,” says a senior police official, “Anyone who knows he is driving the NIS, usually picks them up in the dead of night at hiding points, including downloading at hidden points.
Most of the time these guys drive with a half-assed vehicle because they know they're snoring their car so they prefer to drive in an old vehicle.”

“A criminal investigation should be launched against her”: Haifa city critic on serious charges against Einat Kalish Rotem
The city comptroller's report shows alleged concern about criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former City Hall officials and political opponents: surveillance of employees and inflated payment to an accountant's office for conducting the investigations •
“The hard findings that emerge from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation” •
From Haifa Municipality, no comment was given.
Municipal employees and political opponents are monitored and an inflated payment to an accountant's office for conducting investigations, “at the expense of the public coffers.”
A report by Haifa City Comptroller Ofer Tal published Tuesday shows alleged concern for criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior municipality officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
Kalisch allegedly met with the accountant's office Barlev & Associates and asked for an investigative review.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to Councilwoman Sophie Nakash, and it was examined whether the tenders between the municipality and between a company owned by Nakash's family, were strictly kosher.
It also follows from the auditor's report that there is complete disarray and lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kalisz met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose task is to centralize and synchronize the works of the accountant and the municipal branches and the data collected by the accountant were not transferred to him.
This has meant that no one in the municipality is aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what is the required scope of work in each of them.
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation has arisen in which the volume of issues in which the accountant has been involved has grown disproportionately, with great intervention in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring on the part of the municipality.
For the report's summary, the audit recommended stopping the unpaid payments to the accountant until material detailing his work on each of the subjects he examined is received.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were under codes like “gatekeepers”, information store, fish shop, investigative review to the mayor and a procurement investigative audit report.
Soon after, City Attorney Marine Klein noted that the mayor had herself signed the approval of the payment in her place.
“Not invited by any audit report and I don't know what this is about,” she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit was about two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels were paid, and about half a million shekels left to pay, from the tax dollars of the public.
Former municipal treasurer Jackie Wakim responded: “These wilful actions made for the purpose of tarnishing the names and names of elected officials at the expense of the public coffers and the paying tax payer is a criminal offense.”
Sophie rapped a city councilwoman in her response: “The auditor's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves.”
Response of Israeli lawyer Sarit Golan, member of the Haifa City Council: The evidence and hard findings that emerge from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the Investigative Review Counsel to carry out investigations, which are doubtful about whether they are allowed by law in the manner in which they were carried out and in particular the investigations concerning the opposition councilwoman to the mayor and former senior employees.”
Lior Datz response from the Gatekeepers Association: “It seems that all the red lines have been crossed that a public authority sends investigating details in order to collect information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption and while the association conducts public proceedings against the administration of the Haifa municipality.”
Haifa Municipality gave no comment.
The office of accountant Yehuda Barlev is not interested in comment.
Gantz revealed: “Iran and Hizbullah worked together to harm UNIFIL operations in Lebanon”
The Minister of Defense attended the International Cyber Conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that “Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their modes of action” •
Gantz referred to Al-Sayyid's record of Hamas captivity, among other things: “A video aimed at blackmail — on the back of a humanitarian issue” •
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: 'We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems'
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke Wednesday morning at the International Cyber Center's Cyber Conference at Tel Aviv University, where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hizbullah to target UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, “further harming Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country,” Gantz said.
Gantz referred to, among other things, a record of Hisham al-Sayyed, who was captured by Hamas in Gaza, which the terrorist organization's military wing released: “Yesterday a video aimed at blackmail was released on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas holds the four boys captive in defiance of international law, contrary to morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this nefarious conduct by Hamas.”
He added that “the State of Israel acts through a variety of means, and continues to turn every stone in order to bring the boys home.
As we have said before -- this is a humanitarian issue, that's how we see it, and on that basis we will continue to act.
Attempts at blackmail and mindfulness exercises will not affect our position and conduct.”
He later revealed joint activities by Iran and Hezbollah: “Iran also operates its branch in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recent activities by the Iranian security bodies in cooperation with Hezbollah have been detected in order to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This was by implementing a cyber operation whose purpose was to steal UNIFIL staging materials in the area, and using them by Hezbollah.
This is another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon, and to Lebanon's stability.”
“Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their modes of operation.
In recent years, we see the phenomenon of Iranian hacker groups working with Israel and other countries,” Gantz continued.
“The New Shippers are terrorists with a keyboard who are like the fighters of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we hurt them and their sender, and even today they are in our sights -- and not just in the cybernetic dimension.
No attack against the citizens of Israel will pass the agenda.
And the responsibility is that of the attackers and of the state that funds and sends them.
Cyber attacks can be answered in a variety of ways in cyberspace and other spaces.”
Gantz continued the attack on the nuclear power: “Iran is leading cyber terrorism -- and making moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and administrations, as happened in the U.S. presidential election and other attempts Israel is aware of.
Actions such as the Shahid Kahava unit that collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under direct directives of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in the debriefing.”
“In recent years, we have stalled many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber-responsibility, 'and to punish companies and entities that do not follow the guidelines.”
Gantz continued to mark Israel's next goals in the face of the threats: “Our supreme mission, in the army, industries and various security organizations is to build the people, train them, and leave them.
I and the Chief of Staff have placed this issue as one of the main tasks in relevant units.
We look at the power building all the time — both in personnel, training and tasks.
In the coming years, we will also need to examine the form of network, management and operation of cyber warfare, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system.”
Finally, the defense minister concluded and called for cooperation with the world: “Our cooperation with the world is of great importance to Iran in the cyber dimension as well.
The same collaborations that we build in the region with Iran in aspects of defense against various threats — we also expand in the cyber dimension.”
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: “We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems.”
Uri, deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit's first public appearance at such conferences, revealed that Israel had foiled an attack on the water systems.
“Countering cyber threats is a key part of our activity.
Our goal is to achieve supremacy over the attacker, to be able to identify him and act to negate his capabilities,” said the 8200 deputy commander, adding “so sometimes we also find victims outside Israel and then we contact other agents if necessary.
We do this both independently and by partnering with industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 You will not rest until the threat is removed.”
As stated, this exposed a threat to Israel's water systems and attempts to poison Israeli citizens: “We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them several years ago.
In another case we also identified that a certain adversary attacked Israel and in the process we identified that the same attacker also tried to target US power stations.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We have been able to prevent this threat by cooperating closely with our American partners.”

Preparing for the next attack: A series of terrorist attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, during which 19 people were murdered and injured about 70 civilians, led the Border Patrol to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to storm terrorists within a civilian population and carry out shooting in traffic.
“Israel Hayom” unveiling: A glimpse of the “Assaf” facility
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security needed to lead a normal life of a civilian population.
The severe wave of attacks that occurred this year, with attacks in Beersheba, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist embedded in a crowd, led the police to think creatively to develop a tool that could be used to train fighters to storm terrorists within the civilian population.
The thinking craft was led by the Training Division of the Police and Border Patrol.
These emerged in a competition in the various police districts under the title “Leading Commanders Learning”, in which each district was required to develop measures to help improve the policing and combat skills of fighters, police officers and commanders.
As part of the competition, and as a response to the need to practice Border fighters for fighting in traffic shooting training and such descriptors, Assaf Ben David, Border Terrorism Combat Instructor in Jerusalem, developed the Assaf Facility, consisting of a dynamic target, attached to a telescopic rod mounted by a carrier that can be harnessed to an instructor.
Their servant who guides the carrier to our death, he can practice the fighter standing in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Patrol fighters and fighters have faced numerous attacks in which the perpetrator, carries out shootings and poses a threat while moving through scenes rife with innocent civilians.
“Assaf Facility”, in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic rod that has been upgraded and integrated into the facility, is taken from the field of maintenance and cleaning.
Using the facility it is possible to model shooting in motion within a civilian population at a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling a stop in motion, choosing a path of progress and performing selective firing including the practice of preventing injury to uninvolved.
Major Assaf Ben David, whose facility is named after him, says: “The facility we developed, is a breakthrough in learning and training fighters and policemen.
The development, provides a relevant response to reference threats and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of development in the face of the relatively affordable cost of production is a significant advantage in the competition.”
State auditor warns: “CEC is not prepared for cyber threats”
Netanyahu Engelman warned at International Cyber Week of Israel's lack of preparedness for crackly attacks •
“World War III will be a hacker war but the world is not prepared for it.”
State Comptroller Netanyahu Engelman attended Tel Aviv University's annual cyber conference on Wednesday and expressed concern about cyberattacks on Israel.
“We are exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it.”
Engelman said that in the framework of the cyber reviews his office conducted, significant deficiencies were found: “In the past year, we have carried out penetration tests in the traffic management center in Jerusalem, hospitals and tax authority systems.
In the audits we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were carried out by public bodies and some conducted penetration tests only during the audit.
There were also deficiencies in the CEC's preparedness for cyber threats.”
“We at the Office of the Comptroller of State undertake to continue to address this significant issue even more strongly, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world,” he concluded.
Aiming high: “I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles”
The choice of red: “From the first moment I was shown to be wanted, I was built to lead a large group” •
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: “I felt like I had a place, wanted to be on the roster for EuroBasket” •
And the period in Maccabi TA: “I learned to concentrate only on what is under my control” •
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will depart today with Israeli national team players to Poland, where they will meet the local team in qualifying for the 2023 World Championship (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the national team will host Estonia in the Solomon Group Hall.
In parallel with intensive training with the national team, Blazer also dealt with his future in the past week, until he signed for two years at Hapoel Jerusalem.
“I have peace now that I found a group,” he tells “Israel Hayom” in a special first interview since the signing.
“I have a little pressure now because I have to move with the family after we have settled in the central area and it is not easy, but there are no phones already and professionally I am much more relaxed.”
You haven't been on the team four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
'First of all, I want to enjoy the national team and I come in an approach of contributing in everything I can, whether it's from my experience and if it's on the pitch.
Of course, I would love to play, but when you get to the national team, everyone has to put his ego aside and do everything to make the team succeed.
I'm here for what they need from me.”
Now you are 14 players, and for the European Championship he will join Dani Abadia, Gabi Chachaashvili will be back, and maybe there will be more changes as well.
You set the goal of being on the roster for the championship?
“I would love to be on the field and contribute.”
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99 m) played for Maccabi TA for the past two years.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks moved to the capital, preferring Jerusalem to Hapoel Holon.
You had more suggestions, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
“They showed a very great willingness for me to be there, so negotiations were relatively easy.
Once I felt a connection with the management and the coach I realised this was the right place for me.
The situation seems good and appropriate to me, too.
I come to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I've spoken to the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and of wins, and that's exactly what I bring.
I have always loved playing in the Arena, because I get energies even with the crowd is against me, and now that they will be on my side it will be even better.
I'm sure there will be a committed and fun group and I wanted to be a part of that.”
Expand a little bit on your conversation with Coach Dzikić.
“Professionally he believes in a lot of no-ball movement, he plans to bring good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energies in defence and attack and with the crowd at the Arena it can be successful”.
I looked at your career and saw that in every team you stay at least two years, if not longer.
Do you feel that even in Jerusalem you can stay for a few years?
'Wherever I go I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem my phone wouldn't stop ringing and beeping.
I've received a lot of messages that are already waiting for me.
I believe we have a good time waiting for us.”
Do you think Jerusalem could be a more significant player than in Maccabi TA?
How do you sum up the two years at Maccabi TA?
“Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional all along the way, and no matter how much I got - I always gave everything.
I am proud of the way I have done this past year, and now everyone is going their own way.”
If it were up to you, would you want to stay in Maccabi?
“After the last year it was clear to both sides that we were heading in the direction of a breakup, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I got a little hurt in minutes and my status dropped, although in the middle of the year I had an excellent period, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized that it was less of the place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me, so I chose it.”
Finally, what are your goals in the coming season?
“There was a lot of talk about what happened in the cup semi-final last season when I shouted to Ami Biton (team manager at Maccabi Tel Aviv), 'That's what I'm here for, 'so that's what I came to Jerusalem — to take titles.”
Wade Baldwin may join Maccabi TA

Raz Adam may be loaned to Urban Ness Ziona •
In Jerusalem, they decided not to exercise the option of Retin Obasuhan.
Hapoel Tel Aviv is looking into the possibility of attaching Adam Ariel if he is released from Hapoel Jerusalem.
Recall, a few days ago we published that the future of the 27-year-old forward at the Jerusalem club is in doubt and it is possible that the team will take advantage of the option of leaving his contract, with a final decision to be made right in the next few days.
Now it turns out that if he does not continue in the capital, Hapoel TA will try to sign it in its ranks.
And in Jerusalem, the club chiefs decided not to exercise the option in Retin Obasuhan's contract for another season and informed him of his release from the team.
Meanwhile, Haggard Raz Adam may be loaned to Ironi Nes Ziona after asking to leave the Reds to get more playing minutes.

All or Nothing: 1:1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadida scored an self-goal in the 33rd minute but managed to repair with an equaliser 10 minutes later •
Later, the knot was turned away in dubious red (74) •
Hadera also remained in ten players following Edom to the duty of Ido Levy (87)
The professional team of Hapoel Jerusalem Sefer Ha'arabot (M'shah) is good the amount of foreigners on the grass in Teddy, much more than once, it should be noted, and at some point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was removed).
This time, to their delight, everything was well, and the 1:1 they obtained against Hapoel Hadera will not be taken away from them by the Association Court.
Before the red absorbed Hadida, he managed to conquer a self-imposed gate and compare to arrange a precious spot for Ziv Aria.
As early as the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida's private show began.
Falkushchenko charged wide, and the midfielder lifted up and rammed backwards and the ball stopped in his team's net.
0:1 to her room who enjoyed a self-conjugation of context.
Ten minutes after the self-imposed goal, Hadida managed to correct and in a giant - Levkovich caught air and the midfielder this time rammed into the right, unseen net.
1:1 in Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to register a second yellow and red for his duty, this time after surging in Marmentini's direction.
Daniel Barr Nathan decided on a dodgy red and sent the midfielder straight for an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Natan also sent Ido Levy in red and balanced the relations of power on the grass as well.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon
60:85
Ariel Beit Halhami's team has clinched a third win in succession, this time particularly impressive •
Huber and Schuchman (15 CA) excelled
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey continued this evening (weekend) with an impressive 60:85 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to the seasonal 0:3 balance in the encounters between the two.
Since falling to last place, Ariel Beit Hechaemi's team has already had three consecutive victories, and in fact it is a surprise only for those who did not foresee in the game.
We haven't seen Holon as bad a long time ago.
All this before the opening of the series against Besiktaş in Playain in the Champions Cup: only 60 points, a first half without three and 11 percent for three in the entire game.
Bottom line is an unimpressive evening for all the team's players (except Murphy Manko, who scored Holon's 3 threes), including the safe stock Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in good shape thanks to Roy Huber and Joaquin Schuchman (15 NK CA).
The first came back to itself in the final period and the second returned to flourish and also wowed with a basket from three-quarters of a pitch.
Give them a chance: The Israelis of Maccabi TA saved Sparopoulos
After a derby loss and an eighth in a row in Europe, a setback in the Classico versus Jerusalem - would probably end the long affair between Maccabi TA and the Greek coach •
So who must Yannis send a bouquet of flowers to tonight?
For his Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points in Arena •
And also: Why in the Yellow Club need to change the 'strategy of Americanization', and take a vivid example from the model of Ariel Beit Hahlehmi in Eilat
It is difficult to remain cynical at the sight of the teary eyes and the warm and strong hugs that Yannis Sparopoulos gave his players at the conclusion of tonight's game at the Arena, and especially in the face of the tight seduction and secret exchange with John Divertholmeo, who, in his hands, saved the Greek coach the position, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after a home loss in the derby and eighth straight in Europe, to also lose in the Clasico to Jerusalem and pull away from it to three wins in the table?
That would've ended the Israeli-Greek affair tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he's got a lot to learn from this game, too, and basically mostly regarding the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi TA came with a radical change in attack and ball drive habits.
The ball moved conscientiously, with lots of movement and drills, and Scotty Wilbekin, demonstrably, left the craft of concentration to Evance, dribbled very little, and mostly passed over obstructions and went off for putts.
Despite scoring very badly (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed in defense, and most notably, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
Towards the finish, though, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team reverted to the old habits, and the attacks reverted back to dribbles and shelling, and in the most crucial attack, with a 2 lead and 40 seconds to the end, Scotty dribbled himself to half-corner and threw a floater on one leg that nearly lost the game.
The trick is to keep playing exercises and a dedication movement precisely in the moments of the clutch, and that has to go into nature and group DNA.
Yannis and the club will do the important learning about the use of Israelis.
Those who have become water cleaners and towel-wafers at games in Europe.
Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them more than half the team's points (42 of 83), and were the ones who kept the game live at the finish.
Four of the top five scenes in Maccabi were its Israelis.
And don't say Israel isn't Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can help in the EuroLeague as well.
In the first half it was mostly Oz Blazer, whose section has been crying out for a month that it must play more.
A slingshot, a muser, a fighter under the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 feet of defensive determination and game smarts.
Isn't that enough?
The second half starred Jake Cohen, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and covering for Žižić's injury, most notably John Dee, who in a 70:63 situation for Jerusalem changed momentum with 5 consecutive points.
With Yiftah Ziv, Yanis has a complex relationship, and he sometimes seems to give him too much credit, overloading him, to the point of risking losing.
It happens in the Euroleague as well, and it happened tonight too.
But the important learning should be the club's, regarding its Americanisation strategy.
Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Wim Madar left for Europe but not for Maccabi, Rafi Menko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrath chooses Jerusalem, or perhaps rejected by Maccabi.
And it happens that in Maccabi there are gradually fewer places left for Israelis, because of an informed and grassroots choice of the club to be based on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play it, and then it will look for Jewish children to be naturalized, and pressure the admin/union to further increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fateful mistake by the club.
And the game we've seen should remind Maccabi that she's overreacting with the foreigners, much because of the tax discount.
Certainly we won't argue that the Israelis alone are enough, but they're good enough to support four great foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediocre ones, allow five excellent ones.
For instance this season, in the money of Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Tylor, it was possible to bring in two stars (star point guard and forward on) effective and stable next to Scotty and Žizić.
It will be more effective, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and generates identification.
It is true that there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group that purports to represent Israel, and even receive tax relief from the state for its representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association/League Manager can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adjusted for the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 on form, maximum three on the field simultaneously.
For the ongoing failed achievements (for seven years now in Europe), just for Maccabi, the league is overrun with foreigners?
And the players' organization, what about you?
That's what you guys were for?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there's one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Hggle to get less?
Previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in the above direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and another 4 Israelis who were only two in the junior teams (Huber, Ben Moshe, Roina and Shachman the Warrior), she dismantled Holon (second in the table!) For the second time in the last two weeks.
It is a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run even in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot in the days of Sharon Drucker.
Short Eilat is simply a more balanced and effective team, and nothing like Ariel Beit Halhaemi, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their peak of strength, everyone plays together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The foreigners only make up.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from a hamstring injury, it will be a tremendous team.
A song I dreamed of Eilat.
And that Maccabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: 'There was a feeling that the whole world was against us'
The yellows are happy after 78:83 on Hapoel Jerusalem Arena: “We are back playing the way Maccabi TA should play” •
About Ami Biton's talk in the locker room, the optimistic first diagnosis of Žižić's injury and management's approval of procurement.
A great sense of relief is noted this morning among the members of Maccabi Tel Aviv after the important and prestigious 78:83 yesterday at the Arena on Hapoel Jerusalem.
The team players and management personnel hugged with coach Giannis Sproupoulos who looked very excited at the finish.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer poured water enthusiastically on the game's outstanding Derrick Williams, and the rest of the clubhouse also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure had loosened after the recent losing streak.
They, too, were afraid of defeat against the great rival that would further destabilize the system.
Fans, too, stayed minutes long celebrating in the stands.
“We have an amazing connection between us and Yanis in a dressing room,” Oz told Blazer.
“We know the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We've been waiting very much for it, too, in the way we've played.
We are back playing in a way that Maccabi TA should play in, with heart and fight, we stand behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us.”
Before the game the team manager Ami Biton came into the dressing room and carried exciting things to the players.
“His stuff had a great impact on how we came out and how we played on the hardwood,” players told Maccabi.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi is already aiming for the important game against Basconia on Thursday and want to nip the long losing streak in the EuroLeague.
“I believe this game will change the momentum for us,” Blazer added.
“We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
“In the last few games we have been under a lot of pressure, Giannis told us that if we are released we will win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
A lot of eyes on us and it was a feeling of the whole world against us, I'm proud to go to this war, we cut off everything around and look only at ourselves.”
Ante Žižić who injured his right knee during the last quarter was examined by the medical staff in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not severe.
Doctors will examine how the knee will react today and then it will become clear how many days of rest he will need to recover.
In the group believe and hope that the player will be fit for Basconia.
Apart from the firm backing given from the management to Sparopoulos and the professional team, at a meeting held on Thursday, professional manager Nikola Vujcić was given the green light to bring in one or two players to strengthen the team, and the Yellows hope to soon attach quality procurement.
Anthony Bennett released from Hapoel Jerusalem
Forward who was picked first in the NBA draft failed to acclimatize a team from the capital •
At the club they said goodbye: “Anthony entered the heart of all of us, thank him for his time in Hapoel.”
Four months after signing for Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released on Sunday from the team's roster.
The forward (28, 2.03) who was selected first in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers registered 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games in the Champions League as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 revs in eight games in the majors.
“Hapoel Jerusalem and actor Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision on permitting the player's contract at the club,” the club said, “Anthony enters the heart of all of us and we wish to thank him for his time in Hapoel.
We wish him only good and success.”
Study states: Zoom meetings hurt creativity
Some 2,100 engineers and academics worldwide have been asked to develop solutions to the problem — some in video sessions, some in face-to-face meetings.
The result: Virtual meeting impairs creativity and thinking outside the box •
Study leader at Columbia University: “The visual focus on the screen impairs the idea-making process” •
Consolation Forta: There is no harm to labor productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study published recently in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of video sessions on participants' creativity, compared to in-person sessions.
Unfortunately, it has been found that creativity is indeed compromised in virtual sessions through screens.
The research question - led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University - was whether remote meetings using a computer preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or does the level of creativity and free thinking drop as a result of remoteness.
The study itself began as early as 2016 but received a major boost in the two years of coronavirus, during which many employees moved to work from home.
“People in a personal meeting move around the room, using objects and using them for creative thinking,” Brooks says.
“In a computer session, however, the concentration in maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more video-focused when interacting, which impairs the broad and expansive idea-making process.”
The space is reduced.
To examine the results of the experiment and verify whether they would repeat themselves, they tested twice — once at Columbia University and once more in real life — on engineers who knew each other from early acquaintance.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts — in one the subjects were asked to meet personally and develop solutions to the problem, and in the other they were asked to do it through a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide similarly and solve in a new way a problem presented to them.
In both cases, a decrease in creativity and thinking outside the box was found among those who met virtual on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who deals with ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, within a thinking activity, people often look at their surroundings to help generate ideas, while in a video session thinking converges to the screen and does not expand in a way that facilitates creativity.
“When the people in the same room they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can trigger new associations in them.
In contrast, research shows that relationships through a computer change our attention so that we are more focused in and on the screen, and this way reduces innovation and generating ideas through looking at the environment and thinking outward.”
There is no harm to critical thinking.
However, and before managers run employees back to the offices, researchers note that “working through a computer did not harm productivity itself nor people's critical thinking of innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
That is, the impact is focused on creativity only and not the rest of the forms of working at a computer.”
Prof. Ellen Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also qualifies the findings.
“There is a difference between just creativity, such as new uses of frisbee (one of the research questions; EG) and work solutions.
It is also possible that when employees are more relaxed after acquaintance, or when they work from home, creativity will improve.”
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also proposed future research in which such sessions would be terminated into thinking situations and roaming the room to see how this activity would affect the final outcome.
Also Dr. Olson suggested that following the study only for brainstorming sessions employees would return to work and as a rule he suggested not to be alarmed by one study but to carry out another investigation in the field.
“I wouldn't want workers to be forcibly reinstated and not be happy is a bigger injury” he says.
Musk awaits Trump's return: 'It wasn't right to block him'
The fresh purchaser of Twitter said that he would reverse the decision, which led to the blocking of the former US president's account •
“I think it was a mistake,” he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter in a $44 billion deal, said Tuesday that he plans to bring Trump back to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after riots by supporters on Capital Hill after his election loss to Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
“I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake,” he said.
“If there are incorrect and bad tweets, they must be deleted or made invisible, and suspension - temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban,” Musk clarified.
By 2050: The world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years •
The solution: proper management of water reserves
A new and disturbing study published recently in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050 the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by 80% if the rate of water consumption and world population growth remain within their current usage trends.
In the study, involving scientists from all the world's scientific agencies, scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers and fresh water sources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The dismal conclusions of the study show that currently the rate of water consumption has repeatedly doubled in the last 10 years, while at the same time global warming causes rainfall to decrease in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study's data, 84% of the world's agriculturally designated soils will experience heavy rainwater shortages.
One of the key conclusions emerged from the study calls for farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and seasons, and switch to growing methods that would make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the process of evaporation of water that would lead to widespread waste of rainwater.
Also, the researchers recommend that farmers working near salt water sources, use rainwater collection technologies in order to prevent it from flowing into the sea.
Information about many students from Bar Ilan University leaked online
Hackers who attacked the Bar Ilan University database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the student information if they did not receive a ransom.
The threat was realized and the information was posted across the network.
Students at Bar Ilan University are under attack by hackers when their personal information is posted across the network by a network attacker known as Darkrypt and who several weeks ago posted a ransom demand from the university's personnel and threatened that if he was not paid an unclear amount of money, he would publish the information under his control.
Estimates of the amount of money demanded by the attacker are that it was an amount that started in thousands of dollars and as the clock lifted, it rose and before the information was published it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are filled with angry messages and the mess is celebrating there, with students unable to log in to their personal information systems and cannot perform regular student assignments.
The university sent an e-mail message stating the assault suffered by the academic institution and that they were working intensively to reduce the damage, detailing some of the information leaked to the network.
No special instructions were provided to those whose information was compromised and it was said there that the university had carried out a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's servers.
Lined up to 40 localities: The optical fiber reaches Benjamin
The fast internet peripheral networking trend continues and now the fiber optic reaches Binyamin Council, which includes 40 localities •
The project in collaboration with the council and telecommunications companies Telran, X-Fiber and Rimon Internet will be launched right after the holidays.
The Benjamin Council signed a wide-ranging agreement on the weekend to place fiber optics in all council settlements.
The agreement with NetFiber in collaboration with Rimon Internet, Teleran and X-Fiber was signed after the conclusion of a large tender on which the Council had been labored in recent months.
The work will begin after the holidays and residents from 40 council communities who will be interested in connecting to the fiber optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 GB as well as advanced edge equipment to the home that will allow strong WIFI reception, as required at these times.
The accentors will be able to choose between high-speed internet over fiber optics or fast filtered internet over the same fiber optics will provide online grenade.
The Council made sure that the market remains open to competition in any situation.
The head of the Binyamin Regional Council, Yisrael Gantz: “This is true Zionism.
It's a big news for residents.
The experience of living in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to study remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in communities that will receive high-quality Internet without delays.
I want to wish success to the valuable companies in the execution tasks in the communities.
The residents are waiting for you.”
Gantz added: “Soon we will get proper high-speed internet conditions among the best in Israel.
We have labored for many months to bring a foundation to install the fibers and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank Communications Minister Yoaz Handel who started the project with us in his previous term and now we are reaping the fruits of the labor, the staff of the Minister of Communications, the Council members who were in charge of the details of the Center and the CEOs of the companies that won the Center for professional quality among the best in Israel.”
Rimon Internet CEO Yariv Peer: “I thank Council Chief Yisrael Gantz and his team for immediately lifting the gauntlet to bring a line to thousands of council residents who will move to using a fast Internet that will upgrade the quality of life in the fields of education, economy and of course leisure.”
Talran Communications Group CEO Shai Aslan: “We are delighted at the Binyamin Council's decision to connect with a powerful high-speed Internet infrastructure and I am confident that thanks to the group's extensive experience, we will be able to provide residents with just as fast internet as in the center of the country.”
Ex-Faber CEO Yisrael Elitzur: “The construction of communication infrastructure in Binyamin is the Zionism of 2021, X-Faber is proud to take part in the construction of the latest infrastructure in the biblical areas of Benjamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with the areas of Jerusalem in general and Binyamin in particular, we will meet every engineering challenge in order to bring the high-speed Internet to every home throughout the council.”
We checked: What do the side effects after the coronavirus vaccine say?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weakness, fever, and fatigue after receiving the injection, while others feel nothing •
Could this indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these effects, or is it a fundamentally deprived rumor?
While more and more people get vaccinated, the lack of information about the side effects continues to confuse and generate rumors, most of which are not true.
Is the immune system of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies responded less harshly to the vaccine, which could perhaps prove that their system fails to struggle with a foreign body entering the body?
“There are several levels of responses to the vaccine,” says Dr. David Dvir, head of the Division of Primary Medicine at UNITED and a member of the advisory board for the CET (epidemic treatment team), reassuringly: “Headaches, fatigue, pain in place, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body reacts to the entry of a foreign body into the system”.
Is there a relationship between the levels of antibodies you develop and the side effects?
“There is no correlation between sensations and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 60— 50% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
It was not found that people who developed strong reactions were more protected.”
“In the medical literature, there is no correlation between immediate response and immune level.
In some of the trials where people were also given placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It is also a mental component - how the person perceives the vaccine, if he expects there to be side effects.
A lot of the effects that happen could have happened normally as well, but because the public has been vaccinated, it attributes the response to the vaccine itself, and this is the bias you see regarding vaccines in general — attribution of phenomena that happen next to the vaccine and are attributed to it.”
According to Dr. Dvir, the causes of the reported reported phenomena, such as weakness and headache, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis (myocarditis), opinions are divided.
“There are all kinds of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One of the theories is that it is a strong response of the immune system.”
Is there even a possibility to assess the strength of an immune system?
“When students were exposed to the flu virus, they showed that those who did not sleep or who were under higher stress were more vulnerable to infection.
Apart from this, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there is a decrease in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like anyone walks around with a weak immune system and isn't aware of it.
These are people who come to inquiries due to repeated events of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we don't want an immune system that's too strong either, because it can cause autoimmune diseases.”
Soon mRNA vaccines will appear in more contexts, thanks to the vast knowledge that has accumulated about them in recent times.
“There is no doubt that an opening for other vaccines of this kind will be paved.
This technology has been tested for many, many uses beyond vaccines — for treatment of oncological diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance stays very little time in the body - enters, does its action, and then breaks down.
This technology isn't new, but it's gotten a serious boost following the very big need for a fast vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week interval between dose and dose is too small, and some vaccine experts argue that it may be that after a third dose we won't need another vaccine in the near term, so it's unclear whether we go to vaccination every six months or if the third dose will give a larger margin.”
Thousands hurt: Severe privacy default on Route 6
Route 6 customers?
Your private information, including full name, addresses, payment amounts, and full details of your travel, may have been revealed.
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, the Land Road company violated the Privacy Protection Act and its regulations.
After a report passed by the Derech Eretz company, the operator of Route 6 in Israel, about a security incident that occurred at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement process.
As part of the incident, security weaknesses were discovered on its payments website, which allowed the disclosure of a lot of information from the invoices of the member's customers, which were exposed in plain sight.
Among other things, customers' payment invoices were disclosed over a short period of time and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates and at what times.
In addition, since the Land Road Company did not properly record access to its systems, it is not possible to know precisely for what period of time non-authorized entities could access the company's systems.
In the breach letter provided by the Privacy Protection Authority to the company, the Authority stressed that most of the largest companies and organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that with the development of threats and risks, the organization has a duty to rigorously review the updated risks and act in accordance with the current security measures in accordance with the nature and nature of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations have the obligation to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and intrusion tests, to examine and prepare for changing risks.
In addition, it is mandatory for companies and organizations to use an automated documentation mechanism and trainings must be conducted for employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Protection (Information Security) Regulations.
In accordance with the Inspectorate's findings, the Authority determined that the Company violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Act and its regulations and also required the Company to carry out a number of corrective actions.
From the Land Way Notebook, operator of Route 6 reportedly: “The issue has been dealt with in accordance with the strictest requirements”
Journey warning to Istanbul: Surprising row for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change destination or date for their flight
The line for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the journey warning: Airlines will allow the flight dates to be changed.
Reminder: Earlier this week the Counter Terrorism Headquarters raised to rank four the severity of the journey warning to Istanbul.
This is the highest level and means “high threat level: this country should not be reached and in case of stay leave the country as soon as possible”.
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus said they would allow Israelis who booked their flight before the departure of the journey warning, that is, before the date of 13.6.22, to replace their destination or flight date.
This is by calling the airline.
Tourism Minister Razvozov said: “The citizens of Israel should not pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
I am glad that large airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have complied with our request and I hope that other companies will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey because of the severe travel warning.”

Saudi Skies Approach: Israeli Companies Are Preparing to Overcome Lines to the East
The summary that is forming for expanded freedom of flight over Saudi Arabia: the airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe
Israel's largest airline is planning major changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we published in “Israel Hayom”, it is estimated Biden will announce permission for El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to other destinations besides the UAE.
The significance of the agreement being formulated is that Ask About will be able to fly shorter routes to Far East destinations and to Australia.
To do this, the company will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, in order to clear planes in favor of new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled from this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations where there is a fairly small Jewish population, but at this point they are less profitable for society.
The new destinations in El Al, on the other hand, are Tokyo, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
Here's how the move will take place: the Drimliner planes flying to Canada will be released in favour of long-haul flights to the East.
The Boeing 737 aircraft flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which El Al operates flights using the Dremliner aircraft.
So basically the company could release large aircraft to fly to more destinations in the east.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines can return to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Exempted from isolation for vaccinated and recovering from non-red countries, the foreign tourists return.
Those landed in Israel have received notices from the Ministry of Health that they are exempt from the isolation obligation upon receipt of a negative response to the coronavirus test.
Only after that, the Ministry issued an official statement stating that only those were passengers from orange countries, although even returnees from red states reported receiving the message •
In addition: Tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and the removal of many red destinations from the list is expected.
At the height of a pandemic - the end to isolation for returnees from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent messages to Israel on Monday morning, saying they were exempt from isolation upon receiving a negative response to the coronavirus test they carried out after landing in Israel.
These are also Red States captors.
Some of the messages sent informed returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative answer or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative answer.
Only after that did official announcements from the Ministry of Health stating that starting at midnight, 4 January 2022, vaccinated or recovering, those who return from orange countries will perform a PCR test at the NPA and go into isolation for 24 hours or until receiving a negative result (whichever comes first).
The decision will be enshrined in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be approved by the Knesset Health Committee.
The Ministry clarified that vaccinators or convalescents who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they carried out at the entrance to Israel, will finish their isolation tonight at midnight and are not obliged to conduct a second test.
Despite this, travelers from red states reported that they, too, received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and returned from an orange state will enter home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening isolation with a negative result in a pcr test performed starting from the 7th day of landing in Israel (landing day is the first day).
The decision to remove most restrictions on flying and especially the vaccinated comes a day before the High Court hearing submitted by the Association of Travel Offices, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association.
At the hearing tomorrow, petitioners are expected to demand that all other Red States be removed from the list, with the one who backs them in his opinion being Professor Itamar Grotto.
Foreigners will also be able to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transport concluded that from Sunday January 9, 2022, immunised/recovering foreigners (according to the definition of the Ministry of Health) will be allowed from Orange countries - subject to filling out an online form ahead of time, performing a PCR or antigen test before boarding, conducting a PCR test at entry into Israel, followed by entering isolation for 24 hours or receiving a negative answer in the test (earliest of them).
Unvaccinated/non-convalescing foreigners (by the definition of the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red states, except for those whose entry was approved by the Committee of Exceptions, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The outline of the teams will not be renewed at this time.
And what about red states?
The Committee for Classification of States in the Ministry of Health recommends that the government be removed from the list of red countries and transfer to the Orange List the countries: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain at this point in the list of red countries: UAE, USA, Ethiopia, United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option examined by the Ministry of Health is to exempt from isolation those vaccinated who return from red states.
At the moment, it is unclear whether there is a connection between the messages they received this morning returning to Israel and the instructions that may be received by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
The Department of Health has not yet received a response.
The sky begins to open: the Ministry of Health changes restrictions on the gates of the country
Vaccinated returning from orange countries will be charged 24 hours solitary confinement •
The countries USA, Turkey, UK and UAE will be set red.
After many weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which to fly without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were committed to solitary confinement, along with the ban on entry of tourists to Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on the NDP.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend cancelling the duty of isolation for three days for Israelis returning from orange countries.
Until now, any vaccinated or recovering according to the definitions of the Ministry of Health who returned from an orange state - has been charged with isolation for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Now, the isolation that vaccinators and recuperators returning from orange countries will have to enter is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of coronavirus tests performed after landing at the airport (whichever comes first).
Those who are not defined as vaccinated or recovering will nevertheless be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two coronavirus tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if returned from an orange state and if returned from a red state.
A vaccinated or recuperator returning from a red state must also be in complete isolation.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, and which still need to pass government approval, includes the U.S., Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, except Turkey, the average of positives entering the country in the last two weeks is more than 5% of total arrivals, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase in patients from Turkey is rapid, the rate of positive recidivism is just over 4%, so it was decided to put it on the list of red countries as well.
The most prominent countries to be removed from the list of red states: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
As of January 9, tourists vaccinated under the requirements of the Ministry of Health will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, and similar to the conditions of Israelis returning from an orange country.
In this case, too, the decision is subject to approval by the government, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases where the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
The purists are against the restrictions.
The Travel Office Association, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association submitted a petition to the High Court to overturn the restrictions on flying.
The state lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but as stated left eight significant states on the list of red states.
At a hearing to be held in Jerusalem this morning, petitioners are expected to demand that the state revoke the list of red states.
The one who will support the petitioners' position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razvozov, who in recent weeks supported easing in everything related to the introduction of foreign tourists to Israel, said yesterday: “Eliminating isolation for vaccinated people returning from abroad and the return of tourism to the vaccinated are the right and just thing during this period.
I thank my friends in government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the harm outweighed the benefit.
Vaccination is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to conduct an enabling routine alongside the coronavirus.”
With an investment of 200 million shekels: the new resort that will open near Arad
The desert is booming: Another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years •
Chef restaurants, private pools and 110 rooms are just a fraction of what the hotel will offer •
All the details in the article
The 7MINDS company from Fattal and the White City Buildings real estate company jointly purchased a plot covering a 20-dunams stal in the Judean Desert, where they will establish a luxurious resort with an investment of about 200 million shekels. The hotel will be built on the same territory where Masada Hotel was built, which was demolished a year ago.
The Resort will only open in about three years and will have 110 rooms with some private pools.
The hotel will also have three shared pools, a spa, chef restaurants, a recreation complex, a gym and more.
The one who will be in charge of the culinary side of the hotel is chef Ran Shmueli from the Claro restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one to build the menu that is expected to have a unique desert concept for the resort.
The mayor of Arad, Adv. Nissan Ben Hamo, welcomed the project: “The decision to build a new and prestigious hotel near Arad gives the official stamp to the incredible appeal that Arad has made in tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the entrepreneurs' choice and convinced that it will be a joint success since it is a huge tourist potential.”

Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Budapest, Berlin, Amsterdam and other destinations for less than $100 for round-trip flights
.
Israel's largest airline is reporting an increase in demand for flights abroad since yesterday's announcement of the significant easing for flights.

The offer is valid for bookings made today and tomorrow and for flights that will take off until January 31, 2022.
Starting at midnight tonight, France, Spain, Portugal and other countries will be removed from the list of red states.
The United States, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and five other countries are still on the Red List and there is a ban on flying to them without the approval of the Exceptions Committee.

Israel Mail must not be privatized
The question is how many packages arrived and how many were distributed?
Because some have disappeared to them
Order packages, and they disappear in the sorting center in Modiin...
There should be a 5 NIS package tax that won't just order any nonsense and load the mail
This is mainly indicative of the cost of living in the country.
Thank King Paks for making it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to approach the mail and hope that no letters will come from them and the hatred of mail has led us to give up anything belonging to the possibility of mail.
Good week.
Lay off all postal workers, and start re-establishing the post office - by a private company.

It is seen that there are professionals in Maccabi- Blatt and Katash.
Perhaps personal abilities are still comparable to a Scot but a team player, and especially game intelligence are much higher
So sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis warm the bench
By the way Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners and therefore wouldn't make it with all the stars scraped from around the world
Who is this interesting???
If you already watch a game in which 6 American players and 3 Israelis for decoration, isn't it better to watch a Golden State game???
Puzzle until he gets connected. League is over
Good luck
Good column.
Loved.
About the Israelis, he's totally right!!
And a comment about Ziv - we saw last season that this is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he may not be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost confidence (which is no wonder after the attitude he received after 2 bad games in the EuroLeague, as if foreigners did not have such games) and his use may also be incorrect, and is the result of the coach's fixations and stencils.
Blazer didn't get scored with all due respect...
Yiftah Ziv doesn't have to be in Maccabi Tel Aviv. He's putting it down too much.
There used to be no good acting but Sorkin and Blazer Doody and also Cohen today well done.
Ido Eshd idolized a Holon fan who gave him 500 shekls so he writes nonsense.
Pictured not Federman.
Blazer, Sorkin and Gek Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor, in Europe, playing about 20 minutes and unable to score a basket, who needs foreigners at nothing and nothing, much better the Israelis play.
It's good to have a good spirit for everyone. Coach players and management at the Hammontum
Depends on increasing internal carving...
and Disciplinary and Required Strengthening of the Vagarde Coordinator
And that's the management part.
Not true.
Unmediated human interaction is important from many, many aspects.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is a bad thing both from the professional aspect and the truth, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the camera with zoom and the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom and therefore their creativity was not enough for this solution?
How do you know what will be in 30 years
Someone missed an important detail here
The scientists are not interested in warming nor rainwater
Only interesting is the rate of population growth
They're working on more and more vaccines and bastardized methods to decimate the world's population so they tell us pogee stories about warming and more crap they make up
There is no problem to desalinate water, in unlimited quantities
They said that 50 years ago.
In the meantime, there are more people.
The solution is to limit birth, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the rest of the leftists are against their states, and in all religions that believe in gods - in the stupid, the ignorant, the kassailim, the blind, or in short - in the herds
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living beings (also sesamolans) consume oxygen and emit report carbon.
The solution: smolens, kill yourself!
It's green.
Good for the world.
May you be better off, and sure the Earth and all of us.
Who are the scientists and how they carried out the research
I don't believe any study that talks about climate warming because this thing doesn't exist
He is in order to control us to usurp our liberty and freedom.
It's all part of the New World Order.
And reporters like Asaf Golan are on their side like he did during the coronavirus.
I've never heard a show of facts from him on either side always he brings the side that serves the globalists.
Banting us.
Just burning money on academic “engraving” studies.
As usual, another quip from the land of psychopathic smolens.
Things are getting better. Human knowledge is expanding and with it new technologies and improvements.
For centuries now, the world's population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, launched a huge war project in the Gobi desert, with incredible success.
The Saudis do the same and do well too (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It is precisely the stupid “climate crisis” of the Sesmolans (CO2 emissions, necessary for plants) that is the cause of the Sahara getting greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the Sesmolan agenda, so you won't read about it in the papers...
Lefties don't worry.
In them, the urine goes straight to the head and so they do not dry out.
Does proper management of water reserves mean a cut of at least 70% of the world's population?
It is surprising that COVID comes and it is surprising that the majority of the population is injected with experimental material whose consequences for a range of 5-25 years on the injected are not at all known.
Also surprising that Agenda 2030 is getting underway and now this?
Really puzzling the whole story!!!
Hahahaha what bullshitting.
Thousand and night stories, everything scares and of course nonsense of the left trying to control the world through control of the media, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rainfall for two years.
They said that there was no more rain in the country, and the drought is constant and here there is rain.
They also said that Rebin did not murder Jews in Altlana and Peres did not know that Tamanim children were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan obviously did not rob antiquities and Azar Weizmann did not mess with his soldiering.
It's obvious you're promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Nasty drivel.
They will also take care of the reception in the hinges, the treatment of the power outages and voltage drops and we are on the wave
“This is true Zionism” as the opening of the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
In the wake of crook Bennett, the rest of the lacken politicians will sing a line in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I don't come close to a supergod, more correctly “shoe on”
It was very pleasant peace and no goodbye.
You won't see us in dreams either.
One more big shame, we in Israel are captivated by Alal Company. All direct flights in its hands are cutting prices Better go bankrupt, it's time for a truly open sky.
Some focus on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows Al-Al to fly over its territory, then it won't add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big game changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, acquisition of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia Qatar and the Emirates, tourism allowing Israeli Shatian companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
That's a lot more interesting than 30 planes a week that would save an hour each.
It is more important that they let the air force squadrons settle in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran and organize the Egyptian and Moroccan emirates of Bahrain to drop armaments on Iran without stopping for a month until the complete destruction of all its military forces.
And for another Air Force squadron to settle in northern Saudi Arabia and strike Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from the east from a less crowded area.
After we're done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait-Djibouti and the Comoros Islands into a peace treaty with Israel and get a majority of Arab League countries joining peace.
After the regime's replacement with Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and Erdogan's replacement also allowed Saudi Arabia to overthrow power in Qatar and finally eliminate the subversion of this country, and its support for the Muslim others and Hamas.
When all these common interests are over, it will be possible to talk about a few more flights of al-'el if any al-'al survives until then.
El Al should be shut down.
They sell tickets for flights that don't take place.
The worst is that there is no way to get a representative
“There is no customer service.”
Anyone who buys a ticket in El Al and wants to change or cancel forget about it, a sure loss.
Be warned.
Air Canada is better off
In any case prefer to fly in foreign
Arcacaqo has turned from a society shit into a society hell
El Al have also gone down a level.
Best call a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you sued by train to field
40 euros Briefcase Brianair much cheaper than Wiz.
A backpack weighing 8 kg can be raised.
Why are you misleading?
Air whizz on luggage and seating take a lot more significantly!!!
One big ramble
Just for example, I just got back if you had an Ahaiad
The permissible weight is 30 Kg
And Trulli 7 Kg
And each extra 1 Kg $30
Go keep up to date
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices but at the end it is a bag the size of a school bag.
Trolley already costs money and a suitcase costs very very expensive.
Good thing the companies don't ask that we come on a flight with underwear and a singlet so there's no weight on the plane.
At El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% cost when booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, using the Succeed method.
A land eats its inhabitants and eats.
To this must be added genetic stinginess.
Also a shame for our country that lets foreign airlines market the Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does as he pleases
So what have you learned today that it is not enough that you have paid for an expensive ticket.
Make us all a surprise.
You'll pay extra on the wheels of the plane, the windows, the luggage that doesn't come, for the food, the drinks, and you'll probably add up on the toilets
In short, you will leave at home and prices will drop..
Or big go out in ships
Journey will take a few days
You'll throw up, and then you'll probably come too.
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and hurt Israel, while still winning the support of his new fans.
Open now?
This is no accident.
It is precisely when the mess begins to be excused, it is simply delusional what is happening here...
This is not the peak of the pandemic
Simon, not right for you
Number of verified rises does not mean the number of patients is rising
Stop getting tested for any nonsense, sit at home if you don't feel well
The story is over
A government of nutjobs
The government and Bennett mostly bankrupted.
Loss of control.
And especially idiocy
and public confusion score 0
Only more harm than action
Suggests you to open a new corner: “The number of deceased daily and accumulated from the beginning of the fifth wave.
The face and images behind the default”.
Your ratings will sop.
You don't understand the Secretary of Finance for not paying compensation to tourist workers
Maveem More Contagion
They do not interest them from the people
8500 have died by now
Anything talking about that?
burying us, especially the elderly
We've become Russia/North Korea.
If not to talk about it - it does not exist!!
The main thing is that citizens put money into the state coffers to raise for ministers the ruck and buttocks!
Apparently Doberman and Abbas are the Prime Minister!!
Very well, the omicron delay was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to single out half a people, and there is no point in trying to stop the omicron - which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange state, they are statistically less dangerous than anyone who is already here.
This is the first time I have seen sensible steps by the Israeli government in combating coronavirus.
As if someone actually sat and calculated numbers, and not like Bebe - did what seemed to him to look better in the paper (and failed on all counts).
The Government of the Halam at its best:
A finance minister telling the road teachers to find a new profession two weeks ago, washes to open the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education is beeping at the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and setting her own policy that puts all schools into complete chaos!
Foreign Minister, a clown who arrives sick in Corona for a cabinet meeting.
And the most buffoonish prime minister we've ever had in the country, not controlling the situation and losing his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government without leadership, without direction, that all the people of Israel have lost faith in
Go home and beautiful one hour earlier!!!
My opinion, maybe it comes from a bad place but from a place of loss of control
Now prices for apartments there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Where are all the forecasters?
Building a bus station and believe it will affect all homes.
By the way except for sponsorship fees after.
To find out Arad's exorbitant property taxes, the hotel will return to being a white elephant like its predecessor
Looks awesome.
Lots of success.
Fancy me.
What about the art of being photographed completely naked?
Giving up the garbage
Feit serious to field Breer
From the Mushasheh Harabant Why they do not give benefits to girls in the occupied Galilee by the Muslim Brotherhood of Mishash Harabant
All for the Lackens
In the current reality, the South is still ours?
Need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
MKnesset members will probably be there too!!
What about a folk melon for a folk person?
Well done for investments in the [blooming] south
Arad is developing and thriving and well done to the mayor who since the beginning of his term has had an explosion for the good and the glory of the city of Arad
Cultural life, society, education and more about the height
Just a great mayor who improved the city!
Well done
I wonder how much sponsorship fees for Bedouins will pay the resort owner.
Have you prepared money for sponsorship fees?
Wow, sounds good
Those who can only afford to have a company with service and security, the best in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai something know????
Don't about a tin company.
Neither sociable nor economic.
In recent weeks, she canceled return flights from abroad, you see, sent messages to Israelis telling them that the flight was canceled, ruined the entire trip on the place, informed passengers leave a message on W.App and O in Messenger and we will return, return after two or even three days.
The trip was ruined.
Besides is it better to ground planes on the ground, rather than make the flights back to the country, and prevent economic damage as well?
Any other suckers flying Alal?
Free doesn't fly with them either.
Have you brought back the millions of customers they took captive yet?
EasyJet to Geneva round trip 70 euros.
El One Direction $560.
From the deceitful religious who controls the company along with his fucked up son I don't even buy for $10, non-stop scammers...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be supplemented by the price change.
Whoever purchases tickets put their money on the wing of the plane.
Tin Company.
Low Cost Company Exercises.
No luggage, no seat choice, certainly no taxes and no food.
Vacation and flights to Corona...
To all the members of the “gooalizia”... about me!
Nature dilutes fools!!
