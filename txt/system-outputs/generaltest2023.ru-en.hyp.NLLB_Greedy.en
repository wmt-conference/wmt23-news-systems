The July issue is traditionally sold out during the Moscow Film Festival, and it's certainly very sad: to read the strips when the soul is torn for Shabroul.
However, we will talk about the MMFF next time (until then, I will only complain that this year the inexplicable idea that happy ticket holders are more important for the festival than accredited guests has finally been consolidated in the minds of the organizers, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world is guilty of), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and on "CinemaView".
The cover of the July issue features another nice face - the title character of Robert Rodriguez's "The Predators", and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story of "The Beginning" by Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman"...), the most anticipated movie of the summer.
And this time we publish the first part of a rather detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here there is certainly no need to advertise anything special, and it is clear that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshcheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolyn, Tamara Donduryeva, Nikolay Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kushnikov, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mezenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozov, Nev Pears, Alexey Prostsyakov, Seraphim Syk, Adam Smith, Mleba Soliva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelnikov, Richard Streisley, Richard Olshanov, Elegant Tiuchkov, and Olegant Solov, who has decided to serve in the Russian spy list, and who has become a suspect in favor of the former Soviet spy, Boris Shavitz.
She'll be cornered, she'll be painted in our usual black, and she'll go off on her own to find the truth.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fateful boy-woman promises to further consolidate the position of the actress in the action genre.
She'll be setting up one car crash after another, running around the walls like a Matrix, and throwing strong men in the same tight suits like children.
That's kind of how beauty is supposed to save the world.
Here he is, the native who blew up and fixed the world with the Fifth Element and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy ever, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of evil.
And yet, all in all, it turned out to be not a boring American-style blockbuster about saving humanity, but a living carnival.
What Besson did for 13 years between The Element and Adele... I don't want to remember.
He's been busy, to say the least, but all that script-production fuss and the rare, tortured directorial gigs will be forgotten.
And Adele... I'm not sure she is.
When you watch this movie, it's like 13 years ago, there was no Besson, but a double.
And he, the real one, lived in a small apartment on Montmartre, drank wine in the café across the street and wrote a story about the most charming adventurer.
To retell the plot (even in its most basic features), heating up expectations, in this case is more sinful than usual.
The whole incredible drive here is that behind every turn or line, there's a surprise waiting for you.
And all of them are nice.
Is it a girl or a vision?
The court's unusual involvement
The worst adventure movie of the decade to hint that "Adel's Extraordinary Adventures" will start as "Ameli", sweep into "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy's comic strip about journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgeois only appeared in three films before Adele.
She was nominated for the César Award for her role in The Girl from Monaco.
The director doesn't run after the audience with his hand out, begging them to appreciate special effects, sets or tricks, but he takes them along, like an old-fashioned novelist, who exclaims before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: "Come on, my reader, great things are waiting for us!"
Besson treats the genre cinema he knows everything about as if it were a child who has seen old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating the mundane, not denying the cynical, not being afraid to take risks.
♪ I'm the one who's gonna make you ♪
The film is based on the novel by the same name by the French writer Jean-Luc Godard.
SUMMARY: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city has been overrun by an ancient monster, brought to life by an old psychic.
The excavated creature is being pursued by the police, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Natural History Museum, and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much to the beast itself, but to the medium  she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl is smuggling a real mummy out of Egypt.
I'm not going to be able to do it.
Adel...  the case where the parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it in a new way.
So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino's gangster fighters, the aforementioned Indiana Jones (who was both adored and ridiculed), and finally, the same Fifth Element.
Besson's style in this film is one of verbal trickery, actor's clown and plot equilibria (circus terms are quite appropriate - the union of the two arts here is organic and strong as ever).
A few words about Adele herself.
She embodies the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality as the purest courage and courage.
In the movies, they usually put a macho on duty or a romantic on duty.
I'm not going to let you go.
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical exhaler, which only spins under the feet (only its knowledge in zoology is useful).
So the energetic girl doesn't waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun spending time in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained in numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely out of shape, Luc Besson showed an unexpected creative frenzy, reminding that the boundary between the preferences of bored visitors to mega-malls and the high-voiced regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for the cheerful madmen.
A game of adventure cinema without sadness, fear or blame
The death chamber.
A tightly-packed horror with a claim to psychology and political context, Jonathan Libesman's 2002 horror debut was panned by critics, but was well received by audiences and made a good profit at the box office, and most importantly, caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director got into the factory, forging new horrors in the old ways: Bay set out to remake all the classics of horror and commissioned Libesman to direct "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
Critics again squeezed, but the audience again liked  Libesman worked in the spirit of  new scary, emphasizing the excessive physiology of violence.
In fact, you can see the whole genre convulsing in his case, trying to invent new ways to influence the saturated audience: the naturalistic blood of the splatters merges with the catching up of the slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the "Pila" franchise, but without the liters of blood.
The prototype is Vincenzo Natali's debut film Kub, which was made by Michael Bay.
So in "Death Room", Libesman was forced to take a different path: a dull slaughter or a monotonous run from a maniac, he preferred a more intelligent option - almost without the notorious bloodshed, but with psychological games and puzzles.
The evil doctors here are playing cat and mouse with the subjects.
And three men in a locked room trying to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and take orders from outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only are they being tested, but so is an ambitious young intelligence operative being tested for ruthlessness by a seasoned professor who has been trained in wild experiments.
SUMMARY: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They're put in a locked room and given a bunch of papers with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat walks into the room, poses as a doctor, and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, with government agents closely watching behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror film, but not enough for an arthouse.
He can have a social conversation and a fire extinguisher in his face, but he can't get a skirt out of his hair.
Charming Nastya, on the other hand, is careful and unyielding in her sympathies.
She is wounded by her father's courtly lifestyle and frankly watches as he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's "Showguard", dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her younger brother from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not the difference between generations or the choice of profession, it is, in one way or another, already predetermined, but the unsuccessful attempts of the girl to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Mger Mkrtchan, along with Pavel Bardin, filmed a melodramatic comedy with Ivan Urgant "Troy and the Snowman".
DePardieu has done a convincing portrayal of a teenage daughter's father in a comedy.
The plot of the film revolves around the love affairs of the characters, who are constantly discussing psychology, and themselves, apparently by a witty director's discovery, emphasize the language of looks and gestures.
Secondary plot branches (the girl maimed in an auto accident, whom Alexey wants to marry, the sportsman-alkas in the performance of Sergei Gorobchenko), unfortunately, are only punctuated.
Especially the line about the football player-buying business, and the one that got left behind.
SUMMARY: The biggest concern of a football salesman is his teenage daughter, Nasty.
The heartbroken dad changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she's bound to marry a guy with a "stern".
What a disappointment for a businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in the peak of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential catchphrase for the film's audience, the author came in at number nine: "Don't look for a problem where there isn't one".
Their resemblance is uncanny.
Both films feature a squad of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who set them up, and each company is led by a beautiful girl.
The characters are dropping in almost the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploiting the same stunning footage - and there and there something explodes filled with dollar bills and a whirlwind of dollars descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are difficult to distinguish from each other (played by both Patrick  Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Previously on Avatar, Zoe Saldana played Neytiri.
Sylvain White used to do a dance battle movie called "The Brotherhood of Dance".
Chris Evans was recently asked to play a character from another comic book: he's going to be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that ran in the '70s and was rebooted in the 2000s, and Joe Carnahan was inspired by a comedy series from the '80s.
It's just amazing how they, without agreeing, brought different material to an absolutely identical, thunderous denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary fights that evoke a lot of memories of paintings with Willis and Schwarzenegger (the comparisons invariably turn out to favor Bruce and Arnold).
If you choose between these two films, Losers looks a little bit more cute and clearly wins from the point of view of the CPD (although the budget is three and a half times less).
At least we have Zoe Saldana here, who's a great bazooka.
The film is based on the novel of the same name by John Green, and stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, and Columbus Short.
SUMMARY: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of CIA commando mothers betray their own bosses: the helicopter with the children they were trying to save is blown up, and the soldiers themselves are presumed dead.
But they're alive and they're determined to get revenge on the dark-voiced scoundrel who set this whole thing up.
That's all very nice, but to be honest, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting is only worth it if you have no other options.
Made from recycled materials, a conditionally edible action figure.
A simple story about a Romanian escapee
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
Basically, with just this data in hand, you can visualize both the hypothetical content of the painting and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, cinema promises to be highly social.
It will certainly be realistic, yet tough.
There's a high probability of non-professional actors.
Also, there will be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from film to film,  poor especially).
Also, without knowing the year of release, it is easy to mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who in the early 80s were lectured about Bresson
The film won the Grand Prix of the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andreea Valean, whose work is in particular demand among the directors of the Romanian "New Wave".
Marius Panduru, the cameraman, often works with Cornelius Porumboy.
All of this is true of Florin Serban's debut work, and - don't get us wrong - it is not insulting, but rather a recommendation: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when the faith of its representatives in the methods
I'm not sure I've ever wavered in my work.
And this moment must be captured: only with this faith can you endure the spectacle of a Romanian colony for minors for an hour and a half and give yourself to the charisma of the most talented Pistrean (whose history, despite the chasm separating the two cultures, can be easily
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter)
The film is based on the novel of the same name by the writer and director, John Green.
SUMMARY: After being shot four years, 18-year-old Zack Sylvio (Pistero) is about to be released when he unexpectedly learns that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the young man's behavior becomes inappropriate.
The affair with the social worker Anna further incites the boy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the painting.
What a load of crap!
You want to watch, watch.
A good debut, and a glimmer of hope that the Romanian art house will one day grow into a decent direction.
A cartoon about the joys of crime and family life.
The directorial debut of the man named Grob (Sop) and his co-writer Reno is made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all the Ice Age, Horton and Robots.
"Ugly Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch in the zoo, especially if you like when different objects are tempted to jump from the screen into the hall), it is well written, and, most importantly, there is not a single low-beat joke, because of which in the "Ice Age" one had to shamefully squeeze into a chair and cover children's ears with hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the sense of measure of the authors, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the reluctance to touch the topic of pedophilia in any way.
The "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, is a rather harsh black humor (which, I would like to think, we owe to the director Coffin).
Overall, it's a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it's even too perfect and right.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought through every detail to make the film appealing to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see cartoon characters eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic blast.
Storyline: The villainous bear Gru, whose childhood dreams of space travel have been transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to enlist the help of children to execute his grand plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In some advanced shelter, he adopts three orphaned female children - Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, whose killing prowess is comparable only to that of the cat from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children are quick to overturn adult plans.
The main character is drawn with Christopher Meldren - both are bald, nosey and prone to black humor.
The original cast included Steve Carell and Jason Siegel.
In the final, Grew dances the part of Travolta.
A van pulls up to an abandoned trailer in the middle of a deserted wilderness, and three pairs of the world's best tits emerge.
That's the way it is.
The bearers of this gift are not so important in themselves.
The camera is firmly focused on this part of the body.
For the fans, the good news is that the whole movie is in the same vein.
Rick Jacobson understands the right things about female beauty, and he's casting in such a way that what happens on screen is secondary.
And there's a lot of fun stuff going on.
The Broker, the Killer, and the Stripper dig in the sand, get watered (don't ask why), carry some kind of purge, and occasionally fight very fiercely.
The creators think a mothering calf with generous shapes, smeared in mud, a broken nose and shiny whitish teeth is cool.
"Bitchy Stuff" is primarily focused on classic sexploitation films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of Xena: Warrior Queen and The Amazing Adventures of Hercules.
A film close in spirit in the Moscow box office   A Stone for Jennifer.
It's even cooler when the bitch beauty is turning eggs to the bandit, the punk asshole is fighting a couple with the Japanese schoolgirl, the samurai sword and lesbian sex are added to it; and the intrigue is unleashed through an endless number of flashbacks.
So for a movie fetishist, this is a real Klondike of pleasure.
Now, of course, Jacobson and his gang had a lot of fun making this thrash parody, but the task itself seems pretty strange.
If it wasn't for the actress's physical gifts, it would have been boring by the middle.
You can assume that this game came to us from the adult night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on the serial episodes)
♪ I'm the one who's gonna make you ♪
Three dangerous beauties lead a mafia boss into the desert, who has a fortune in diamonds hidden somewhere in the desert.
After shooting the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to fight and fight with each other and the regularly arriving bastards, as well as kiss and squeeze regularly.
As the case progresses, it becomes clear that all three are not who they were initially thought to be.
I guess the author thinks it's more fun that way.
A product for the narrow circle of monstrously bad taste lovers.
Yes, with his latest painting, "Judgment Day", stripped down to "Mad Max" for the poor, Marshall has made a serious dent.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum restores the director's shaken confidence.
The new, unpolitically correct and grim magnum opus is not shy of a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and a fierce cinema aesthetic of the category B.
There's the hooligan courage of the Dog Warriors and the beastly brutality of the Descent.
Marshall's plan to rid the Pepper of the post-gladiator filth has largely worked.
In 2011, Kevin Macdonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among them the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough men trying to marry their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
The murder and the spicy details of the natural needs of the ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening distribution in the German forests of the now-standard "Gladiator" Sir Ridley Scott, but trying to accuse Marshall of plagiarism for some reason absolutely does not want to: he works honestly and without complaints.
The film is based on the novel of the same name by John le Carré.
COVER: The lands of modern Scotland occupied by the Holy Roman Empire
The remote outpost where the centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) is serving is ruthlessly crushed by the Picts' scouting force.
Miraculously saved, Dias is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, attempt to escape from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadistic Itein (Kurilenko).
The delicate art house artist has only managed to win back the sharp secondary roles in Hollywood so far, but I really want to believe that after "Centurion" the situation will change.
Peplum - edition corrected and supplemented.
Almost like Gladiator, only more modest and harsh.
The continuation of the story of schoolgirl Belle (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young men - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-cultivator Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans were holding their breath.

Bringing an iconic character from the '80s back to the big screen.
Consider George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn for a very curious existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from the public in a small Italian town and slowly coming to terms with human nature.
"A visionary artist on the scale of Corbyn and the magnificent George Clooney are a cinematic union made in heaven", boasts the studio's press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love affair in Clooney's life - with Italy: the filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel The Very Stealthy Gentleman, Rowan Joffe made some changes to his script: the English narrator was replaced by the American in the title, and the gun-runner turned into a simple murderer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to sort out his latest case and finally quit his lucrative craft, his icy heart melts under the charm of the local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Rutten), with whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
"Jack is tempting fate", says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is closing in on him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may not be who she says she is.
Judging by the trailer, Korbain's visual experiments, spiced with Cluny's ash-chevel (the film is similar to the long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the lead in the film adaptation of On the Western Front Without Change.
Can I shoot you with my camera gun?
Johnny Depp was in two places at once this season.
First, in Venice on the set of the thriller The Tourist by Florian Henkel von Donnersmarck.
There he plays the tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Second, in Puerto Rico, on the set of The Roma Diary, the film adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The film was directed and written by Bruce Robinson (Whittle and I), whose last directorial effort was the 1992 thriller Jennifer 8 (Jennifer 8).
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the domestic prison drama, one can even doubt what inspired them.
But you can't take the idea literally!
However, it's good that the heroine of the Russian film is foreign, but not bald.
Director Dennis Dugan specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have four collaborations to their credit: "Lucky Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: A Fire Wedding", and "Don't Mess with Gohan!"
In July, the fifth comedy, Classmates, is released, and the sixth, The Pretender, with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The seventh film is also scheduled, a romantic comedy, where Sandler will play both Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who is best remembered for this year's feisty action film "Pipet", will be in charge of the X-Men reboot.

The script is being adapted by the author.
Cary Mulligan has been cast as the female lead.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of practical Major George Smiley - the protagonist of a series of novels by John le Carré - in the screen adaptation of the thriller Spy, Get Out!
The first adaptation of the play was in 1979 with Alec Guinness.
The new version will be directed by Danish director Tomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer is adapting the fantasy best-selling novel Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell.
The director admits that this is not easy (the novel has six parallel plot lines), but it is extremely interesting work.
He has already proposed to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McEvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
In Crimea, the shooting of the international fighter Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of luck" is taking place.
It's about millionaires who went to war for their money, looking for adrenaline.

The film is scheduled to be released in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy Baby Jesus alongside English pop star Pixie Lott.
Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3.
The film company assures Ragatoip that the firing is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler.
However, the role of the main character and the new lover of the hero Shaya LaBaff will most likely be taken by English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley.
The girl has no experience in film, so she will have to take accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not frighten the experienced viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful re-qualification of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron (Monstro), Angelina Jolie (Stop the Life), Jessica Lang (Blue Sky, Tutsi), Kim Basinger (Secrets of Los Angeles), Jennifer Connelly (Games of the Mind), Gina Davis (Casual Tourist) and First Vice-Miss USA-86 Halle Berry (Ball of the Monsters) started out as model runners or modeling for fashion magazines, and eventually won an honorary Oscar.
Successful in acting (also the beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, which is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurilenko.
The rewards are clearly within reach.
In short, Rosie has a role model.
Valeria Guy Germanica, who won the Special Mention of the Cannes Jury in 2008 for her film "Everyone will die, but I will stay" and who filmed the scandalous TV series "School", was appointed creative director at the MTV television channel.
The channel believes that Valerie will bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germania has also begun casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" by director Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into "Screamers".
The main theme of the film remained the same  provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Habensky) hurries to Moscow to his bride, but is delayed to train the football team of the homeless.
The second plot line of the picture received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the bride of the capital will be played by Milla Iovovich.
As an added intrigue, a third, Nadia Dunn's ex-fiancé (Ivan Urgant) will appear.
So, in addition to the question of whether the home team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma as to who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays of The Hobbit and the availability of a mass of third-party projects, Guillermo del Toro has declined the position of director.
The studios are trying to persuade producer Peter Jackson to take matters into his own hands, but he's only willing to do so if it's absolutely necessary.
The possible successors are David Yeats, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
The official name of the new director will be announced at the next Soots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie is going to play Cleopatra.
Stunned by the tight schedule, critics and cinematographers were racing between the Winter Theater in Sochi, where the master classes were held, and the "Pearl" hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held, barely managing to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved like this - almost everyone ran somewhere: confused Asians from "Gastarbeiter" Yusup Razykov and "Other Heaven" Dmitry Mamoulia searched for the missing grandson and wife, the fugitive bandit from the picture of Yuri Bykov "To live"
The same cops were happily surrounded by the finger of the detective Klim Shipenko's character "Who am I?"  who, however, was remembered by the audience rather by the presence in the frame of the totally naked Jeanne Friske.
Heroes of the domestic show business appeared in a couple of competition pictures - in the film "Elephant" Sergei Shnurov played a truck driver who was taking a circus animal to the slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets discussed favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the two-person film "Satisfaction", where business partners called each other to an alkoduel because of a lady.
However, the business events at the "Cinema Theatre" also had a noticeable imprint on the show - it was not boring at any of them.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian arthouse, the chairman of the fund for support of domestic cinema, Sergei Tolstykov, had a picturesque quarrel with critics: "Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?" he asked the gathered menacingly.
"I write them", said the president of YERVEZS, Andrei Plakhov, confused.
The scandals did not end there: near the end of the festival, the film of Alexei Fedorchenko "Oвсянки" was suddenly removed from the competition program - he will go to Venice: the selectors of the Mostra decided that the excessive Russian show would interfere with them.
Previously, the "Kinotavr" did not interfere with the giants - in Sochi, films of large festivals were shown more than once: this time, for example, the film by Sergei Loznitsa "My happiness" participated in the competition, which competed with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun on the Azure Beret in the spring.
Nikita Sergeyevich at the "Kinotavr" visited the film of the former Cannes competitor and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury Karen Shahnazarov did not like the picture of the Loznica, on the contrary, but under pressure from colleagues he was forced to give her a prize for directing.
The award for best debut   Missing   went to her daughter
A chilling film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive, humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked into monstrous acts without any visible purpose.
A carefully staged, purifying film experience shot by a misanthrope with a math education that calls for only one thing: start thinking.
A philosophical debutante, Mamulya calls the films quotes from Mamarashvili, avoids any events in the script, and claims that the joy of the viewer is in the effort to comprehend his little-known meditative films.
The most difficult picture of the "Cinema Tour" has already been selected for the competition of the Karlovy Vary "A director's star is born".
The immaculately dressed and trimmed computer programmer Leonid reacts to the world with a restrained disdain, hiding in the den of a neat bachelor life.
But the iron woman descends on the house, the unjust hand of the punitive organs on the hero's head, and he begins a meaningless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's useful to work with more than just debutants", producer Sabina Yeremeeva said from the stage as she accepted the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull an "internal debutante" out of the corridor of domestic art cinema.
And it's symptomatic that in our cinema today, the geeks are going after the youth.
Not the other way around.
A documentary shot in a way that's more mind-boggling than a similar art film.
The author is interested in a screwdriver that examines an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter floating on a cast-iron pan, all of which turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover and her criminal brother into a real oil-on-canvas docking station.
Short-meter winner Nikolai Sokolov is trying out the black-and-white French new wave style in the world of sleeping areas.
Although the story of two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, may seem strange, but for a rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality, thank you.
Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the type An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 are raised to the sky, equipped for the time of work with meteorological equipment and technical means of impacting the clouds and loaded with special ecologically clean chemical substances - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide (dry ice), meteorological pyropatrons with iodized silver and powdery reagents.
The process is as follows: airplanes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break" with these reagents the clouds that go to the city.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned and exactly where the clouds were impacted.
For ten years, work has been underway on a remake of the sci-fi film starring Michael York.
Recently, Karl Rinsh was appointed director (he already has a remake of "The Creature from the Black Lagoon" in the schedule), who became famous for his advertising clips.
Previously, the project has been associated with the names of Brian Singer (X People), James McTig (V means vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
The plot follows a thirty-year-old man who is forced to escape from a death sentence because the society of the future executes all citizens after reaching that age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a rotoscopic fantasy cartoon from the '80s and plans to make it into a major motion picture.
The original was a collaboration between director Ralph Bakshi (m/f The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of painted boobs.
In it, warrior Larn saves Princess Tigre and the entire nation from the evil Ice Lord Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to be careful about creating Inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero is going to be putting his zombies on vacation soon, as he plans to remake Dario Argento's classic Jallo movie.
Bringing the heroes back to the big screen is none other than Michael Bay, master of action, explosion and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damien Chen, who will adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on Day of the Dead and had previously worked together on Two Evil Eyes in 1990.
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will be joining Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy Arthur.
"I wanted to bring more power to the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China", Chen says.
Chinese women are now running big businesses and winning Olympic gold.
Gong Li is the embodiment of that power.
This is the second time in a row you've played a fictional character.
Is that a coincidence?
The pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I represented here (at the "Cinematheque" and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE) two paintings.
And I play the dream woman in both.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he introduced me, and I think a lot of people think that's how I am in real life.
The dream girl.
Your partner in the film, Alexander Yatsenko, is nothing like his hero.
How did you find common ground?
He's not at all what he seems at first glance.
I saw him at first and I thought, "Yeah... it's not just me who has to".
I guess without human contact, genuine and real, we wouldn't have made it.
And that contact happened literally within minutes of us meeting.
We're great, I'm not afraid of that word, we're friends.
I told him all my fears, all my worries, all my fears that I might not succeed, and I asked him for some advice and some help, and he was happy to give me that advice and that help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do that because I was so afraid of losing that connection, of losing our understanding.
And so at the premiere, we watched the whole movie holding hands.
How was the filming in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I first came to.
I've never toured there, never been there on vacation, never been there as a kid.
This city has a certain magic, a certain character, a certain charisma.
And it's a city that you want to come back to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everyone always arrives on time.
So it wasn't hard for you to play the city lover.
You're actually very organic on screen, which, frankly, a lot of people didn't expect.
How do you work with roles?
Do you find emotional scenes easy to handle?
You know, I'm not a professional actor.
And I'm a very trusting person by nature.
If I come and I agree to work with a director, I'm basically putting myself in his hands and I want to be the dough that he's going to make.
I know very well that the obvious side is, and I, again, ask for hints and talk to the director for a long time, not even talking to him, but he's having preliminary conversations with me and explaining very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then after many hours of rehearsing, we come to this organic thing you're talking about.
And how was working with the director Klim Shipenko?
I was excited about everyone, the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was willing to go without sleep, without food - and here was exactly the same situation.
No sleep, no food for days and days, no matter if it's thunder or hail.
And if something didn't work, it was a disaster, and you have to do something urgently to make it work.
It's very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And it seems to me that when people are so driven to a sick fanaticism about what they're doing, it can't fail because it takes too much energy.
What scenarios are you refusing?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want any nonsense, any stupid dialogue, any film that says nothing, that means nothing.
I don't want to work for the sake of just being on the screen one more time.
Do you have any suggestions, any projects that you're going to be working on in the near future?
There are no concrete proposals or plans at this time.
I'm not the kind of person who makes charts.
The script came in, it got me interested, and today was the premiere.

I'm not a social network.
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is first and foremost a story of paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools of the Internet, which connected the world, broke up five friends and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire in decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is as brilliant as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg started the site for a whole bunch of reasons: partly out of anger at the world around him, partly out of a sports interest, and partly just because it's "cool".
The idea and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of the "social network" are evident from the first shots, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) for less than five minutes: the loud, tough dialogue of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gains strength already here and does not soften until the very end.
The same with Fincher's direction: comparatively restrained (except for the Winklevoss Twins played by different actors.
One of the faces was computer-generated and then superimposed on the other.
Natalie Portman was a Harvard student at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara was cast in the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
♪ I'm the one who's gonna make you ♪
♪ I'm gonna be the one that you're gonna be ♪
SUMMARY: A sullen and reclusive Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg, is given a personal turn by the gate and embarks on an ambitious project to create a radically new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few of its friends-companions begin to unravel and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its part: warm, sunny in places, cozy even in the dark, it maneuvers between two entangled chains of events and two separate legal disputes.
There's not much going on outside the flow of the film's endless discussions: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal hassles are unlikely to stretch to an extra paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this not-so-generous story?
And after watching it, there's a persistent feeling that "Social Media" is a portrait of our time, and that the unspoken is an important artistic technique.
Just about 20 years ago, Wall Street was doing pretty much the same thing, only on a much larger scale, with cosmic egos and big business.
Now that the daily rate of payment has gone up even further, policy is no longer being conducted in board meetings or sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, wants to be the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
Winklevoss, meanwhile, is stomping on the ground: Who says rich, handsome, and athletic can't be smart?
(This line is especially amusing to Fincher.)
If you wanted to, you could make a black comedy out of "Social Network".
Zuckerberg is obsessed with popularity and leadership, but what's more in his business, positive or negative?
And what are the social implications of this invention?
Is he a con man?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin would never close a book if there was even the slightest hint of something like that.
But they won't even need to do that here, because in their version of history, it doesn't matter.
"What is it like to feel beautiful?" asks the song Tre VenaNez "Wabu Wac"te A Vsp Map", which precedes the title track.
The hero doesn't know.
The film gives us the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of a lost online generation that has little concept of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully crafted character drama about the high-profile courtroom trials of the Internet era.
In the early 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames of people of insignificant origin had not yet begun to appear.
We were called "that son, that son".
So there were patronymics going on, father's names.
But sometimes, for example in the case of father's remarriage, matronymic surnames were used.
Susanna is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna".
The serfs of the small landowners have really been without a surname for a long time - what's the point of it when you have 20 souls and everything is always in sight.
But the owners of the many-thousand estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
For example, the serfs of Prince Andrew of Cherkasy already had surnames all together at the beginning of the XVIII century.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep the man on the ground, but let him go on a rations - let him earn a craft and pay the master.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where the surname was to be entered.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released on hunger strike.
So they already had last names.
Criminologists from the capital have arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Central Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Investigation Center have arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the gas explosion at the house on Linear, 39, according to the NSS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbach and Yevgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Mejregiongaz", examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality parts, worked inefficiently, and overcharged for their services, the agency said, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Linear, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house 39, where the plates were being changed.
So, in one of the apartments, they put a water hose instead of a gas one.
Kavon, however, denies this.
He said it was impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed, one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, resulting in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, the sea flood was avoided
The arguments of the week.
Saint Petersburg → The company

The flooding was prevented by the closure of the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
The sea flooding was prevented by the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd on the list, according to the St. Petersburg edition of Neva.Today.
The water level was 184 centimeters, but the closure of the sluices in the Gulf of Finland kept the water at 168 centimeters, just seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
The weather conditions were complicated by a gusty wind, whose speed sometimes reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can again sail through the Gulf of Finland.
Ten weather stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland monitor the water level.
This prevents flooding that can follow strong winds.
Turkey: 8 arrested in case of building collapse
Eight people have been arrested in Turkey's Şanlıurfa province over construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
According to Armenpress, this is reported by Habertürk.
The earthquake that struck Turkey on February 6 killed more than 20,000 people.
The number of injured exceeds 80 thousand.
The earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7-magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of Iran and the President of the country
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has sent congratulatory messages to Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Seyed Ali Khamenei and President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ibrahim Raisi on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
This was reported to Armenpress by the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran Seyed Ali Khamenei reads:
"Your Highness,
I would like to extend my warmest congratulations on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions have special significance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing a stable and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations, which have been hardened in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will further have even greater achievements for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
I wish you good health and long life".
The congratulatory message addressed to Ebrahim Raisi, in particular, reads: "Your Excellency, accept my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The unbreakable Armenian-Iranian relations, based on centuries-old history and mutual respect, are of particular importance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of joint efforts, we will be able to bring interstate cooperation to a new level, the multisectoral agenda of which will be further expanded for the benefit of the welfare of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Stressing the importance of our vision for establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I reaffirm the official invitation to visit Armenia addressed to you during my visit to Tehran last year.
I take this opportunity to wish you new achievements and the friendly people of Iran a stable peace".

Subscription to video: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In Great Yarmouth, England, a World War II-era bomb exploded Friday as bomb-disposal crews tried to defuse it.
The powerful explosion was heard for tens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel who were defusing the bomb were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after the work on its decommissioning began.
Fortunately, all personnel are safe.
Authorities are assessing the damage", Norfolk Assistant Chief Constable Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents are writing on social media that the blast shook homes 15 miles away.
The photo was taken by Sky Revolutions.
Photo caption: The explosion occurred against the plans of the bomb squad, but there were no dead or injured
The 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea coast, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the bomb squad built a sand barrier around it, and a 200-meter-wide fence was erected to keep outsiders from entering.
The bomb technicians had originally planned to use the robot to cut the detonator off the bomb on Thursday, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to local press, to use the technique of "slow burning" of the explosives.
It was in the process of being burned that the explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
In the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from the autumn of 1940 to the spring of 1941, known as the Blitz, alone, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, said Alesya Solovey, a research fellow at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The proportion of women among science candidates and science doctors is also increasing: among science candidates, women make up 41.1%, among science doctors - 21%.
In all fields of science, except for technical, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical science, in which women account for 64.4%.
Only in the technical sciences are men predominant, with women making up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than in the republic as a whole, by 10.2%.
Among the candidates of science, the proportion of women is 46%, among the doctors of science - 20%.
More than half of the professors and lecturers in higher education institutions are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31,8%), among the deans - 38,7%, deputy deans - 44,6%, and department heads - 42,5%.
Women are the most numerous among senior teachers and teachers - over 60%.
The proportion of women among the professors is also high (55.2%).
According to a national public opinion survey conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, most Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
The gender stereotype of "science is a male field of activity" is not accepted by 63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) to some extent.
More than half of the country's population do not hold the opinion that women are less competent as scientists - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"Transforming gender perceptions of women's research competence in the mass consciousness is helping to attract young women to science, develop their creative potential, and form a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institute of mentorship", noted Alecia Solovey.
February 11 is the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to promote women and girls in science, encourage women to pursue scientific careers, and recognize women's achievements in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The probability of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina after the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have deteriorated markedly - the price of Russian oil has fallen.
On the other hand, the economy is doing better than October's forecast.
The shift in demand patterns continues: consumption remains subdued, private investment slows down, but budget spending is rising.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks have generally increased.
"So this year, the probability of raising the rate is greater than the probability of lowering it.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation", said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, a rapid upturn in consumption amid heightened inflation expectations, should the factors that restrain consumer activity ease.
Second, there is a growing labor shortage and productivity growth is lagging behind wage growth.
There are also risks of further tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the earlier noted strengthening of proinflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher key rate trajectory than was expected in October.
The updated forecast for this and next year shows the ranges for the average key rate increased by half a percentage point to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have diminished.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some rate hike may be needed to bring inflation to the target of 4% in 2024", the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved requirements for the procedure for creating special closed investment funds (CIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be excluded from the existing retail PIFs.
This will allow the management of the remaining liquid assets to be launched and investment-share operations to be resumed.
If more than 10% of the blocked securities are in the retail IFI, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed IFI by 1 September 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares in the new fund in an amount equal to the shares in the main fund.
There is also the option of changing the status of the retail fund to a closed fund.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10% the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets to a separate closed-end fund.
In addition, it is required to inform the shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special PIF.
In the future, in the case of the sale of such papers, management companies are obliged to pay owners of investment shares at least 90% of the proceeds every quarter, according to the Bank of Russia.
In addition to the industry's results, the experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Analytical and Expertise Center of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia, passenger traffic of air transport decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation - by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic was 95.2 million people, and the passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic was 17.2 million, down 26.7% from the previous year, while domestic traffic was 78.0 million (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by state support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in place, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could get a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
Also to ensure the availability of aviation transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc. with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to capitalize "Aeroflot" by 52,5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidies to the industry (so far allocated 25,3 billion rubles), in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (internal passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, to 103.0 million people", - share the forecasts of PSB analysts.
A 6-year-old child was killed in an attack in Jerusalem.
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were killed in a terrorist attack in Jerusalem when a speeding car crashed into a bus stop.
Six other people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
He was later identified as a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions have been classified as a terrorist attack by law enforcement, the terrorist's relatives have been detained, and the house has been sealed.
Meanwhile, Israeli media reports that the attacker had mental health issues and was only released from the hospital this week.
Austria is tightening controls on its border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people are staying in cars at the border waiting to cross it to the Austrian side.
This is a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already passed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Austria considers that migrants are obliged to stay in the country where the request was made, based on existing agreements.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those who want to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and end up between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That's why the police think we need to tighten up the surveillance.
Vienna's decision to tighten checks followed a promise by European Union leaders to spend more on cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the commonwealth's borders.
According to Frontex, last year the number of illegal migrants arriving in the EU and applying for refugee status exceeded the 2016 figure for the first time, to more than 330,000.
The Progress 83 cargo ship has successfully docked with the ISS.
The Progress 83 automated resupply ship successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 a.m. Greenwich, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred 269 statute miles above the South Pacific.
The collision was broadcast live from NASA's Flight Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Flight Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikin.
The Progress MS-22 delivered over 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported the release of the Progress MS-21 ready for undocking from the ISS and further flooding on February 18.
As specified in the press service of the company, the transitional hatch of the ship was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The cause of his decompression is being investigated".
Also, the CUP reported that the ISS crew is not threatened by anything: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal.
The crew is safe and sound and feeling fine".

How pregnant Russians are stuck in Argentina
Argentina's immigration service has begun suspending and revoking residence permits for Russians who have obtained them through childbirth but who have not stayed in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic refused entry to several pregnant Russians, who were suspected of having arrived for the purpose of "birth tourism".
On February 11, they were allowed to enter Argentina by court order.
More details can be found in the article "Gazette.Ru".
Argentina's migration service has begun suspending and revoking residence permits for Russians who have obtained them through childbirth but who have not stayed in the country.
This was reported by the director of the service, Florence Carignano, to C5N.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentine, but spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)", she explained.
According to her, when the Argentine citizenship for the Russian is considered in court, the migration service will file data that the residence permit was suspended because the man "spent a month in Argentina and never came back".
Carignano warned that Russians who get their residency permits after the birth of a child and leave may have their permits revoked.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at an airport in Argentina because of a refusal to enter the country.
According to Georgy Polina, head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, the diplomatic mission attributes the incident to the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls at the entrance to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more arrived on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women had flown to Argentina, but specifically these three had been issued with a precept not to be allowed into the country.
"They were denied entry under immigration law, where one of the grounds for denial of entry is that they provided incomplete, false, distorted information", Pauline said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine migration service allowed pregnant Russian citizens to enter the country by court order, lawyer Cristian Rubilar said.
"They were all allowed to enter Argentina an hour ago", he said, according to TASS.
Rubilar noted that the Migration Service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of children born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows short-term visits to 171 countries without visas, including EU states, the UK and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper reported on a "birth tourism boom" in Argentina among Russians.
According to Pauline, in 2022, from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are going to give birth there.
"In 2023, that number could grow to 10,000", he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that in 2022 about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how the prices for renting housing in Petersburg changed.
It's down 10%.
It is known that throughout the country, rent has become more expensive by 25%, reports the Patrol of St. Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
The one-room house cost 25 000 rubles a month, the studio - 22 000 rubles a month, the two-room - 36 000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
Argentina's immigration service denied entry to six pregnant Russian women, as the purpose of the visit they had indicated was false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the television channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours, the pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them confessed that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, the representatives of the country did not let the Russians into Argentina.
The publication states that the Migration Service has a procedure for dealing with "fake" travelers.
For example, if a woman is 33 weeks pregnant, has no return ticket to Russia, and cannot clearly say where she will go on vacation, she is immediately suspected by the immigration service.
Moreover, experts say that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".
The decision of the artist to leave the theater was planned.

Filippenko said that the management went to the meeting and prepared all the documents.
So he says, "I've never let anyone down".
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is going to a foreign country to undergo "long-term treatment".
As stated in the publication, at the moment the film actor works as a guest actor in the Moscow theater.

On Friday, February 10, the private sector in the Kalininskaya district of the city removed 340 thousand cubic meters of snow.
This information was shared by the city hall.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred private sector streets in the Kalinin district that need to be snowed off by spring.
The road cleaning will be done in two phases.
The first will end on February 15, and the second will run from March 1 to April 15.
114 special equipment units and 123 workers will be involved in the cleanup.

Kirkorov won the fisherman's case.
In the lawsuit, the man stated that the artist's construction was illegal, but he did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman sued the music performer Philip Kirkorov over allegedly illegally installed a pier on his Moscow dacha.
Channel 5 is reporting on it.
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman did not succeed in winning the case.
According to the lawyer, the court was presented with documents, design projects, which confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the territory of the house of the celebrity.
As the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinsky, explains, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff any chance to go fishing.
The application for the executor was filed on January 11.
The star lawyer joked that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky specified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He emphasized that from there, there's a chance to throw the spinning further.
Somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Sleep doctor Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
The expert noted that caffeine-containing foods are often the cause of sleep problems.
This includes tea, coffee, chocolate, and any dessert that contains cocoa.
They should be avoided before bedtime because they not only interfere with sleep but also cause sleep to be "broken", thus preventing the body from fully recovering.
According to the doctor, it is best to stop consuming caffeinated products six to eight hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, to difficulty falling asleep.
Alcohol also affects sleep.
The doctor says that small doses of alcohol help to relax and do not interfere with sleep.
However, amounts greater than 36 grams of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as shallow sleep and frequent night awakenings.
In addition, to prevent sleep problems, the somnologist recommends avoiding large portions of spicy food.
Eating large amounts of spicy food can raise your core body temperature, which can affect your ability to fall asleep.
For a healthy sleep, not only is it necessary to maintain a normal temperature - 18 to 20 degrees Celsius - but also to avoid a high body temperature.
Cherkasova believes that heavy meals should not be consumed before bedtime, since they will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to expend energy on digestion.
She also reminded that lack of healthy sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affect the quality of life and habitual activity, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.

Progress MS-21 has been decommissioned at the ISS: 12 February 2023, 00:12
Roscosmos has reported the release of the Progress MS-21 ready for undocking from the ISS, reports MIA "Kazinform" with reference to TASS.
"The contour of the transport cargo ship Progress MS-21, which is scheduled to sink on February 18, has been de-pressurized, confirmed by the telemetry data received by the CUP", the press service of Roscosmos reported.
It is noted that at the moment it is isolated from the total volume of the station.
The cause of the incident is being investigated, but it did not affect the docking of the cargo ship Progress MS-22 or the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented by the executive director of Roscosmos on manned space programs Sergey Krikalev.
"A cargo ship that has been docked at the station for several months has experienced a heat leak from its thermoregulation system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to our ship (Soyuz MS-22 - TASS) in mid-December", he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the Soyuz incident concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will run a full analysis to make sure there are no problems with the next launch.
"We need to do a thorough analysis to make sure that this reason doesn't extend to designs like this in future launches.
This is the most important task that will now face us", he said.
According to the executive director, there is an analysis to be done in terms of the preparation of the ship for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was performed in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 ship.
"The most important thing is to make sure it's not some kind of systematic mistake", Krikalev added.
The executive director said that a commission was set up on Saturday to analyze all possible causes.
"The ship was supposed to be disconnected and lowered from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz ship ("Soyuz MS-23" - TASS note), therefore serious consequences for the actions of the crew, for the work of the crew... From this point of view, it will not affect the program", - said Krikalev.
The Progress MS-21 truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it was docked to the small Search research module of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered over 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA has named the Progress release site
The cargo ship Progress MS-21 was de-pressurized on the International Space Station (ISS) by the thermoregulation system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Flight Control Center (CCO) during negotiations with the ISS crew, broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from the Progress has stopped.
NASA believes the refrigerant is completely out.
"This morning we had a coolant leak from the thermoregulation system into space, the coolant leak has stopped", a representative of the US CCP said (quoted by "Interfax").
Previously, due to de-pressurization, the Progress circuit was isolated.
Roscosmos has confirmed that the astronauts are safe.
Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11th, and will be removed from orbit as planned, February 18th.

Deputy Director of Russian Railways proposed to Governor of Irkutsk region to master new sales directions
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to explore alternative markets other than the Far East.
This is both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This was the proposal of RZD deputy director Alexey Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As the experience of last year has shown, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "companies" (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal price conditions for transporting their products according to new schemes, - emphasized Alexey Shilo.
The Governor noted the importance of the stability of the shipment of products, the Irkutsk region is one of the richest mineral resources of the regions of the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of stone and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are involved in coal mining in the region.
The instability of export shipments has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of wood materials and products of the metallurgical industry produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Recognizing the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to provide support in terms of transportation.
If additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market appear, we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction, - said Alexey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaysev held a meeting with the active citizens of the villages of Granovshchina and Homutovo
On the instructions of the head of the region Igor Kobzev, the Chairman of the Government of the Angara Region Konstantin Zaytsov worked today in the villages of Graonovshchina and Khomotovo of the Irkutsk district.

An important component of the major repair was the reconstruction of a water-heated heating point, instead of which dry heat was used.
The cost of all the works - more than 80 million rubles.
Final repairs, problems with the grid, need to increase capacity, working with the power company.
In addition, in the Granovskhin and in Khomotovo, Konstantin Zaytsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom the developers sold illegally connected to the electrical networks houses.

- Very often the question of a stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electricity for heating.
So sometimes, sellers will connect homes to nearby networks, which is a reason to cut off the power.
Therefore, network companies in areas where construction is active should pay special attention to this issue, - said Konstantin Zaytsev.

The farm is engaged in the breeding and fattening of dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received for the development of a family dairy farm for 60 head.
Today, the farm has 150 head of cattle.
Potatoes have also been grown here for many years.
The farm manager tries to create all the necessary conditions for the work and living for the collective.

So the government support must not only be maintained, but also increased and increased.
We, in turn, must be the guarantors of food security.
The district's agricultural producers are doing this with honor, - said Anatoly Prokopyev.
Armenian-Turkish border crossing opened for first time in decades for humanitarian aid delivery
The Margara-Alidjan border crossing on the Turkish-Armenian border has been opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
Turkish and Armenian media are reporting this.
The same passage was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating 1988 earthquake, Turkish news agency Anadolu reports.
Armenia sent five trucks carrying 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency aid packages to the southern Turkish city of Adiyaman on Saturday, Ankara's special representative to the Armenian-Turkish talks, Serdar Kılıç, said.
He expressed his gratitude to the Vice-Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinian and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-hit region", Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vaan Unanyan said that trucks carrying humanitarian aid had crossed the border via the Margara bridge and were heading to the earthquake-hit region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margar bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
Turkish news agency Anadolu cites other sources and writes that the Margara-Alidjan border crossing was last used to deliver humanitarian supplies to Armenia to repair the damage caused by the devastating 1988 earthquake.
Then, Turkish Red Crescent aid was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the earthquake-hit areas.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on February 11 that 21,848 people had died in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3553 dead.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are clouded mainly by Ankara's refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, as well as its support for Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss issues of normalization.
In February 2022, commercial air service between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for third-country nationals as soon as possible.

The club world cup match prediction for 11 February 2023.
The Sport Express
The forecast for the Real Madrid - Al-Hilal match of the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup is as follows:
On February 11, the final of the club world championship will be held at the "Prince Mullah Abdullah" stadium in Rabat, Morocco.
The match for the trophy will be between Real Madrid and Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia.
The game will start at 22:00 Moscow time, and the live broadcast at 21.55 Moscow time will be shown by the matchtv.ru website and the "Match! Football 2" TV channel.
Analysts at the BETSITI bookmaker company consider the "blancos" to be huge favorites: you can bet on the victory of "Real" in the main time with a coefficient of 1.28, the probability is about 77%.
Success for the nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even at a draw, the offer is markedly lower at 6.10 (15%).
You think teams can't pick a winner in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1000 rubles on the "peaceful" result in case of winning will bring 6100 rubles.
Bet on the Madrid triumph, with extra time and a series of penalties, for 1.14, this market for Al-Hilal is going for 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia on the way to the final overcame two rounds, beating Moroccan "Vidad" in a series of penalties and Brazilian "Flamengo" in the main time (3:2).
Bet the underdog won't lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes, you can bet 3.90.
Analysts anticipate a large number of goals: a total of more than 2.5 balls is available for 1.53, TM 2.5 - for 2.60.
The Blancos are clearly outclassed by their rivals, whose squad totals just €39.6 million according to statistics site Transfermarkt.
For comparison, the Real roster is valued at 849 million euros.
In addition, to the horror of Al-Hilal, the final will restore the Madrid's main striker and current owner of the "Golden Ball" Karim Benzema.
But even without the Frenchman, Real Madrid is performing well in this tournament: in the semi-finals, they defeated Egypt's Al-Ahly 4-1.
The matches of the Arabs also turned out to be quite bright: in the 1/4 final they drew 1:1 and won the penalty shootout series, and in the semi-final - dramatic 3:2.
The recommended bet: Real win and TB 2.5 for 1.76.
Guberniyev said that the midfielder Pavel Mamaev decided to end his playing career.
The famous TV commentator Dmitry Guberniyev spoke about the fact that the midfielder Pavel Mamaev decided to end his playing career.
"Now we can pour the bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake and for most people, he will be remembered not as a footballer, but as a football offender.
But he's still a long way from Cochorin.
Because no one has ever screwed up their potential like Kokorin.
Mamaev, for all his talents, was periodically noticed.
I can only wish him luck and to realize himself somewhere else", - quotes Guberniyev Metaratings.ru.
The 34-year-old midfielder's last club was Khimki.
The Moscow club did not renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamaev played for "Torpedo", CSKA, "Krasnodar" and "Rostov".
Mamaev is a Russian champion, three-time winner of the Russian Cup and two-time winner of the country's Super Cup as a member of CSKA.

The tanker with diesel from the previously Russian-flagged ship was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Tarragona Naval Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Spanish Ministry of Transport has banned the entry of the Maersk Magellan vessel to the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel, as the cargo comes from the Nobel ship, which until July 1, 2022 was flying the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Tarragona Naval Command of the Merchant Marine General Directorate under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has banned entry to the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the Singapore-flagged Maersk Magellan because the cargo it carries comes from the Cameroonian-flagged Nobel, which until July 1, 2022 was flying the Russian flag", the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with European Union legislation that bans access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag after 16 April 2022 or changing flag after 24 February 2022.
The ministry said the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed.
The ministry reminded that this is not the first time that ships have been denied entry to Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Maltese-flagged Black Star was denied access to the port of Barcelona, which was carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged ship.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, the US and the UK imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian oil products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.

Then the ceiling was set for Russian oil at $60/barrel.
Also, since December 5, the EU has imposed an embargo on the maritime supply of oil from Russia.
Pregnant Russian women have problems entering Argentina
The expert believes that the influx of people wanting to have a baby in Argentina has led the authorities to monitor the entry of foreigners to their country more closely.
The difficulties of pregnant Russian women entering Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in the mass influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and residence permits for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by "Lenta.ru" with reference to SPbSU professor Victor Heifetz, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transshipment point, not a destination.
This is for those who violate constitutional practice.
The expert explained that the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision to grant the parents an Argentine passport after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and left immediately, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, the expert pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Argentina grants citizenship by "right of the soil", that is, if a person is born on its territory.
An Argentine passport allows you to travel without a visa to 170 countries, including the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina has started to revoke the residency of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires has an interest in reducing these cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false data about the motives of the trip.
Russia to open hundreds of new fitness clubs
In Russia, citizens are regaining interest in fitness services, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mostly small-scale, could open across the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs could open in Russia, with their total number likely to increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
This is according to the National Fitness Association.
The president of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, Olga Kiseleva, said that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, there have been more club closures than openings every year.
In the last three years, their numbers have declined by 37 percent.
Independent analysts, however, cite other figures.
According to Contour.Focus, the number of organizations with the main activity of "working in a fitness center" has grown by 10.1 percent over the past three years, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but it started to recover in 2021.
According to 2GIS, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of millions.
Russians have become more physically active, as evidenced by an increase in fitness club attendance.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year over year.
As Silina noted, if the trend is maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The Kirov management company has had its license revoked
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov region has annulled the license for the implementation of entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings, issued by the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, the decision of the regional Arbitration Court annulled the license to carry out entrepreneurial activities in the management of multi-apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made in November 2022, but only came into force in February 2023.
The arbitration stripped the "manager" of her license for repeatedly ignoring the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all the objects that were in the "Care" management are excluded from the register of licenses for the implementation of entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64,800 square meters.
All the houses are in the regional center.
The fact that they lost their management company is known to the Kirov administration.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian law, the State Housing Inspectorate has informed the City Hall of the situation.
In January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set the task for the employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to liquidate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, as there are too many of them.
The legitimacy of the governor's demands caused doubts among the Kirov communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could be taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The antitrust officials also allegedly asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the region's leader's actions.
Wildberries will make the packages payable at the drop-off points.
The Wildberries Marketplace will make packages at pick-up points payable from February 13th.
They will cost from 6 to 15 rubles.
Now the packages are provided by the owners of the delivery points.
If they're not, there's a fine.
As of Monday, February 13, packages at Wildberries will no longer be free.
Marketplace users received a notice that buyers who want a package would have to pay between 6 and 15 rubles for it.
This amount will be debited from the card in your personal account.
The company said the move would help reduce plastic use and help conserve the environment.
As the annex to the offer on delivery services to individuals shows, the executor, i.e. the person who opened the delivery point, must provide the parcels free of charge at the request of the customer.
They must be designed in specific colors and have a specific image.
The packages are purchased at the expense of the owners of the air-conditioning plant, if this obligation is not fulfilled, they are fined in the amount of 10000 rubles for each violation.
Earlier, Wildberries customers had found the site charging money from cards whose data had previously been deleted from the personal account.
This, buyers fear, poses a major security risk.
The support team explained that this was in the user agreement.
It follows that the company has the right to withdraw money from deleted cards without notifying the customer if payment from others does not pass for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, said that the payments with customers are carried out with the permission of customers, and no leakage of bank card data can occur.
Photos from February 2023.
It's a beautiful place, especially in the summer, around the mammoth sculpture and the gazebo with the shelves.
It's not a big park to walk in with your family.
The big parking lot.
The store is on the first floor of the Universi City Mall.
The hours are from 10 to 22.
The shop offers coffee and freshly baked goods.
There's a small parking lot by the mall.
The friendly staff!
Great coffee, great selection of syrups and alternative milk.
The most delicious fresh baked goods.
I'm going to make some big sandwiches.
The convenient cafeteria area
We came with our daughter to arrange a pension.
We received them warmly, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, made the application, told how to book the next appointments.
When you enter, the administrator and security are greeted with civility, respect.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although a water cooler would not hurt to buy more.
We've been here twice, it's great!
I wish all workers peace, good luck and a decent salary, in this difficult time for all!!!
This place is great!
After a long walk on the beach, there's nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of glintwine, waiting for a salad with crayfish (which is delicious!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The nice cashier asked me to make a coffee with her or in the hall, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for 300 ml in the hall.
A couple of minutes later, they hand me a plastic cup.
I wanted to be in ceramics, so I was in the hall.
I got a little carried away.
I'm asking why in a cup and not in a cup.
The girl says, "They don't have a 300-ml cup".
Is that how it fits in a person's head?
Ask yourself or the audience, that is, define for yourself the technology: pour coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
To get the answer, in the hall, that is, in the cup.
I need to narrow it down.
I hear 300 mils.
To confront the fact that there are no cups of that size.
This is a paper cup, 300 ml.
Remarkably, this is the third such case in Green Gables that I can recall.
And what's even more remarkable is that I wasn't offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink the coffee the way I wanted to.
There are a number of questions.
Are the Green Eye cafeteria and the Green Eye the same medal or are they separate organizations?
If they're not connected, there's an understanding.
If they are related, why has a food and retail establishment known in the city for its service and quality been reduced to the rhetoric of a kiosk at Kazan station?
Rhetoric because this is the third time this has happened to me.
I can't rule out that it's not just me.
Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression she was acting on impulse.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please write down the actions for your employees in this case, if you're trying to service.
We love the circus, we've been going since we were kids.
I saw the numbers with Nikulin Yu himself.
And now with the kids, the nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, the programs.
The seating arrangement is very convenient.
You can see the arena from almost anywhere, and the backs of the front seats don't get in your way.
The circus is very intimate, family!
This time we went to the New Year's Eve program.
A little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I'd like a room with magic and lots of animals.
It's a shame you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby anymore.
But there must be a reason for that.
And overall, it's a very nice place!!
I wish you prosperity and to please us with your numbers!!!
The developer at the Department of Construction likes it, so he's picking good sites for housing developments.
They use quality materials, which is totally worth the price.
Before we bought, we were invited to see the complex when there were no walls, so we could see it in real life, even though we had looked at so many apartments and no developer had offered us that.
The favorite ski resort of Russia!
The most fun is the shallow shallow woods, especially when there's a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are boring and short.
The longest ones are in Sector E, and there are even fewer.
But the atmosphere is great, there are many different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
A very good master Perry!
I did it as quickly and as well as I could, and the cabin was clean and nice.
Good service, friendly staff, there's a dressing room and water.
This is a terrible service.
This is the second time I've come to pick up my order at the time of arrival, which is stated in the application, and I've been waiting for my order for more than 30 minutes at the window.
That's not acceptable in business today!
The answer from the Care Service is that we're trying.
At the box office, no apology, just, it's not our fault, it's the show.
No phone calls, no other technical means of contacting your previously loyal customers.
Impotent men are trying, and business must be done.
Thank you all, we're all leaving.
We won't be ordering from you again, and we certainly won't be recommending you.
A spoiled mood, waiting for guests, an apology from the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a Jeep Wrangler Sahara through the organization.
The car was expected to be received in 3-3,5 months (as was agreed), but the fact was 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania was executing).
In the end, I'm very happy with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thank you again!
We rented a cabin for four days for three people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary dishes.
There's detergent and a sponge.
The only drawback is that there's not enough room, and the shower is too small.
There's no storage for snowboards or skis, and there's no place to dry things, so we had to take a dryer from the owners and stick it in instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
It's a nice place to be, in a quiet place.
It's stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
The prices are reasonable.
There's wine and beer for those who want a drink.
The center of Moscow, I recommend
It's a great place with a very polite staff, and we'll definitely be back.
The grounds have all the necessary amenities, including parking and a billiard.
Well-appointed rooms with all the amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I loved it, and Russia in miniature, and the Lakes Park and the landscape.
In winter, there are many natural hills for the child-bird.
Very cool tobacco and hookah store.
We shop here all the time, the prices are low, the quality is top notch!
Very helpful staff, will give you tips and answer any questions)
I recommend this store to everyone! ❤️
The location is convenient.
I'm fine with that.
They serve fast, if any of the visitors don't stumble.
It's convenient on the record.
The staff is attentive, they'll give you tips, guidance, advice even if you're not in the office on a busy day.
It's pretty much normal.
You guys are great!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly, and the prices were reasonable compared to other services.
I thought it was a disposable remote, but they're so clever, they made everything for me.
A huge thank you to the young guys!
Ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with a two-hour delivery on March 8.
They arrived 6 hours later, the flowers were packed as if stolen (there is hardly enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were in the vase, I knew something was wrong.
I checked the website and the color is not what I ordered.
I decided to count it again and it turned out that the tulips were an even number of 20 pieces.
The support at WhatsApp responded to my outrage over the color and number of flowers by saying, "They must have got the wrong color".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
I think that's the ultimate in impudence and would probably fall under the definition of fraud.
I already filed a tax return for the check being denied.
It's Rospotrebnadzor and the court.
I wouldn't recommend anyone get involved with that organization.
I've been going to Samira's for over 10 years, for hair coloring and haircuts.
I want to cancel Samira's Master's Professionalism, she does her job perfectly, I'm always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I recommend this master to all my family and friends.
All her work is always done to the highest standard!!!
A great big thank you to Master Samira 😍
Welcome to the gaming club, I can tell you the prices are great, there are lots of gaming computers, there's drinks and food.
The downside is that some keyboards are broken, buttons fly off, and if you take the "normal gameplay" of the computer, it's not very drawn out.
So the score is 4
This place has become a family tradition.
My son goes to his band practice, and my mom goes to a boxing match.
The administrators are super-attentive, the coaches are professional.
They have themed parties for the kids, cleanliness and gyms.
It's nice to walk and exercise.
The 6-year-old is already holding a good punch, strong PFO.
Recommended for children, mothers and fathers)
The best of the best!
Irina is gold!
She's very professional, very careful, very precise.
Girls are always something to talk about!
The third time was!
I 'll never regret it!
I can finally grow my hair back after lightening it!!!
And Vita is studying color.
So she's the one who's gonna be able to combine the blon with the keratin!
And your hair will say thank you
The master receptionist Elena Polyanska is a very responsive master, she explained clearly everything that is included in the regulated TO.
She also helped me with the repairs on my car.
And also thanks to the master Valery Ushakov for the careful and professional work.
I was ready to answer any question.
The work is done well.
The only thing that was confusing when registering for the TO was not enough correct information on the work regulations, when coming to the TO the regulations were more clearly explained.
I want to express my deep gratitude to the administration staff.
It took a very rare, custodial certificate to get the real estate deal approved, and the staff was very friendly and helped to get the certificate, although they could have refused because it was not their job.
Thank you so much!
There are some very soulful people here.
A wonderful, warm, polite employee, I'm not sorry I came to this barbershop!👍
Nahida did a perfect cut, cut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it to everyone❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for the 800th anniversary, and the interior is stylish and clean.
There's also a cafe and toilets for tourists.
I went on a field trip, too.
And I would definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection.
We've known Ole for over three years, we use the services regularly.
During this time, we have seen Olya grow in her favorite job, constantly learning new things, and expanding the space for the four-legged, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our dog with a peace of mind.
Daily video reports, picked up by a zootax if necessary.
And they 'll bring you something clean and tasty.
It's a fairy tale.
Thank you for your care and attention to our pets 💜
The Saty Los restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They make delicious food.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to book your seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
It's a nice, well-kept zoo.
Less Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
There were 300 adults and 170 schoolchildren.
There were few people, but we enjoyed walking, watching the animals.
The ant's impressed.
Moscow, by the way, hasn't seen him.
There are a couple of cafes on the grounds with reasonable prices, a clean toilet is free, and we've also seen a phone charging station.
I recommend it.
The salon is top notch!!!
I'm very satisfied with the services of Natalia Kuznetsova's hairdresser, I only go to her.
I do a variety of facials, both hardware and mechanical.
I'm 100% pleased.
Master of his craft👍
It's all about skin, and I've chosen a skin care product that's perfect for my skin type.
I'm happy and beautiful now!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
A great club with a huge space, a pool, a sauna, a hammam and great coaches!
The downside is there's a lot of seniors in the pool and locker room.
It feels like they're coming to the club like a public bath!
Special emphasis on the women's section.
On weekdays, from 7:00 p.m. onwards, there's a lot of people!
I'm only giving you a C because of the first visit when I went to see a counselor, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be wrong.
He did everything quickly, he explained everything +/-, everything clearly, the son also decided to draw a map, and unfortunately the consultants are busy with their business, the clients are waiting, the son was approached by the consultant in the end, who was all about the light bulb, he looked at the meeting room several times, which was fun to discuss, in the end the son left, without drawing anything, the consultant said, well, whatever you want, as I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
New office, new layout, all the comforts and the attitude.
It's a pity that the first impression was overwritten, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude to the customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The selection is very large, the quality is good ((the fabric is resistant to the appearance of wrinkles), the staff knows its range, helps in choosing the styles.
You can dress a slim girl and a kid with a non-standard figure and height.
It's close to the subway, there's even a small parking lot.
I recommend it.
It was September, my birthday.
Basically, I liked the service and the quality of the food: the prices are low, the portions are medium, so you can eat or you can reorder.
The only complaint is the table reservation.
When I ordered, I gave the number and everything that was required, and then the bot immediately called to check the phone.
That's all there is to it.
When I arrived at the restaurant, I found that the table was not reserved.
We were lucky to have some seats available and to be able to get a place.
It's actually a very good restaurant with a great value for money.
I recommend it!
I went to the cleaners last weekend.
I have never seen such an organized staff who have responded to my many questions with the utmost care, giving me advice on how and what to do for the further treatment of the dental cavity.
I highly recommend it, the only clinic that doesn't want to make money off my memory.
It's a good mall.
There's everything in here!
A wide range of goods.
A variety of shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
Don't ever set foot in that store again.
We bought a washing machine, they said it was out of town, so we'll drive it ourselves.
The manager in the hall said where to go to the warehouse, to the question "loaded"? He said yes.
When the warehouse took out the box, they said, " Why? " They said, " Everybody does that. "
When I insisted, they slipped me two strips of Penoplex, like it was gonna fit!
They said it's not their job to load into the trailer, so they're loading it themselves.
When I said I'd refuse the order, they said, "Whatever you want, we don't care", and one of them finally got down to help his father push the car into the trailer.
I've never seen such a bad service.
Nice mall. Clean and tidy. Big selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There's a movie theater called Cosmic, a children's entertainment center called Invisible.
There's a big supermarket called Lenta downstairs.
Convenient, large parking lot, convenient location, and the location is perfect.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and household goods.
A wide variety, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
The counselors will help you with the choice, give you advice.
Everyone will find something for themselves.
It's a nice place to spend the evening.
The staff is very nice, the place is nice.
I advise you never to make a mistake. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be super.
I recommend you visit)
We would like to thank Marina Clock, who was our funeral planner.
She came to us on call, took care of all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always on call and kept us informed of how things were going.
It was a way to give our loved one a proper send-off.
Everything was done, organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, who was well aware of the plight of her loved ones, gave us advice on how to make things better and simply felt for us.
He's a very good expert in his field.
Thank you for everything.
After receiving many positive reviews, I applied to RemStirMash and was assigned a master by Alexander.
He began by saying that the next day he was free and available.
We've discussed it and set a time for 2:00.
The next day came - a call from the master in the morning and a statement that he could not come, a complex request (how is it? Where is "completely free?") and, if he can, instead of the appointed 14.00 will come after 18.00.
We'll do it again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another craftsman calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but in two hours.
What's with the tricks?
A day and a half of idle waiting, all scheduled business sidelined!
In short, the clever master Ivan came, fixed the malfunction, for which he thanks.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and waste your time.
The evening's observations have not lived up to expectations.
First, there was a little lecture with some unfamiliar material, then we looked into the telescope.
It was not very organized, children were coming in several times, adults were crowded and could not let others see.
The objects we looked at through the telescope were the size of ordinary stars, and without a telescope, they were free to look at.
The girl's answers were not very accessible, not realizing that ordinary people don't know many nuances.
I don't know why 600.
This amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
The atmosphere is very friendly, the service is always friendly.
The price is average.
Sit down, eat 2-3 meals for two (portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 r👌
There are some interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, like Macho Boracho, which I highly recommend you try.
The price is 420 for 0.5 liters.
And actually the restaurant itself has very delicious cuisine, I don't know how others, and I really liked it, I'll recommend to my friends to go there)
It's a great store, I've been buying stuff from them for a long time, since they opened.
Good quality goods.
I bought a blender, it's been five years, and it's working fine and in good condition.
So when we did the big renovation in the apartment, everything we needed was taken from here.
This is a great gas station!!!
Very conveniently located, there is a care center and side area, generally convenient)!
The quality of the gas is good, I fill up 2 times a week for more than 2 years, no problems, the price is great!!!
Orlat's not a card and cash, not a penny.
The store, I like it!
You can choose any model, at a democratic price, for any purpose!
The staff, always willing to help with the selection.
He took a laptop for his daughter to study because it was full.
They helped, picked up, gave a month's guarantee. Thank you!
The sommelier is working.
He helped with the wine selection, because it's hard to navigate such a large menu on your own.
The experience of working with the catfish is interesting, fascinating Vasily, such in Moscow is not enough.
Eating sudaka is magic, respect the cook.
The kids' menu is like everywhere else, macaroni, fries, chicken cutlets, and my pizza is on fire!
The adults had truffles, and the kids had ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate the smoked ribs, it's the bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
The staff is nice, everyone's smiling, friendly.
We liked it.
WB's brand-new order-supply point is conveniently located.
The work schedule is from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., excluding weekends and holidays.
There are dressing rooms inside the airlock.
It's a very good place.
We have real professionals here who are always willing to help.
There is also a group and chat on WhatsApp for informative communication.
It's a quick release.
It's nice to be able to see and try the product right away.
It's great to be close to home.
It's a great, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that's stated in the description is in stock.
Breakfast is included, a wide selection of dishes to suit every taste.
Easy access, private parking near the entrance.
Hard five.
It's a wonderful puppet theater.
We go to a lot of shows.
We were at the Frog Queen Show tonight.
This is the best of the children's shows so far.
It was very interesting, lots of dolls, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son, he went for the company, and he said it was a really good show.
I took a 10-day vacation with my husband in January of 2023.
The rest of the day went well, everyone loved it!
I 'll start with the order:
On the day of arrival, they called, told us what time to wait, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850p), arrived quickly, there was no traffic jam, we were allowed to pass the jam without any problems.
The administration building is nearby, they're clearing it quickly, 15 to 20 minutes.
All the buildings have elevators, which is a big plus!
The 2-room room is spacious, the floors in the room and in the bathroom are warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rotang furniture (a table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in 5 corpus).
The furniture is normal, there's a ladies' table with a big mirror, the fridge isn't too small, there's even a freezer.
There's a lot of green plants in Building 5.
Everything is clean, they change towels and linen as you wish, but if you don't ask for a change, they still change on the fourth day, good quality linen.
The grounds are well-kept, with shops, clean roads, and beautiful lighting at night.
There's a minibus to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
Public transport stop is five minutes away.
The dining room is full of friendly people, always wishing you a good day.
The food is decent, but here whoever comes for what, we all had a great time, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and sticks or something, vegetables on the side every day, baking is delicious, more than four drinks, coffee cereal, for breakfast always bake pancakes, only cheese and sausage not very.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were lucky with the weather, too, no rain, 11-16 degrees, sunny.
We really enjoyed it, we had a really good time.
There is a desire to come again and precisely in January, when there are few resting)).
Too bad the pool's not gonna be back in service and the gym.
Thank you to the entire staff of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and quality work!
We've been going to Flight since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She likes it, the coach praises it) that's the most important thing.
We're going to see Valeria Nikolaevna Pleschkova!
I never thought the dojo could be so flexible!
While wandering the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to visit this promising establishment - and we were right!
The prices are very reasonable, and the incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in a heartbeat, not even a crust left.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it.
It just so happens that I ended up in Tomrovsky Hospital with high blood pressure and a high heart rate.
And I was very surprised: cleanliness, order, twice wet cleaning, moreover, the windowsills, furniture, doors are wiped.
The food is dietary but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 in the morning they brought tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is very sensitive, they all give both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the I.V. is on, they'll come in, ask how you're doing...
I've had to do an ultrasound of the heart before, but this is the first time (unfortunately, I don't know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Klavdiya Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, literate, gave a comprehensive answer to any question; picked up the dosage and medications that normalized both pressure and heartbeat, which she could not achieve after consulting other doctors.
Thank you very much to the head doctor Mevshe Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the well-organized work of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the nurses, the orderlies, the porters!
When I went to customer service, I had a good impression.
I met the administrator in the lobby.
The competent and courteous staff are quick and patient in helping clients with all their questions.
The specialist assisted in filing the application and gave clarifications on my question.
For a small shop, it's a pretty good selection.
There's the semi-finished products, the milk, the vegetables, the household chemicals, the little things.
It's open 24 hours a day, which is very convenient, the staff is always friendly.
It's nice to have a place in town where you can go mountain biking.
The hoists are bagel and on weekends the final queue is going 40 seconds down and 5-10 minutes in line.
But overall, it's great, the atmosphere is positive and winter, even if the roads are dirty and wet.
I called the service to fix the iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the intricacies of the repair and immediately indicated the price range.
Thank you for the repairs, everything was done with quality.
The masters are very sociable, they show you everything and tell you everything.
However, when the parts were replaced, the camera was affected, the focus was off.
I reported the problem immediately and got a quick response.
The error was corrected in no time, everything is working properly.
The service has good professionals, with whom it is nice to talk.
The prices are reasonable compared to other services.
If you need to be repaired again, I'll be sure to call!
It's large, it's beautiful, it has atmosphere.
But like most historic sites, it's a condition that requires the careful, prompt and qualitative attention of restorers.
So 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the holders.
It's a great train.
Responsive concierges, garbage is cleaned, the grounds are clean and beautiful, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
They've opened a nice, cozy resort in our neighborhood.
There's all the necessary shops.
A killer food court with a variety of food.
The capitals are located in cozy zones.
There is no boredom.
Well, we went there, we tried it...
The interior has nothing to do with the Italian café...
The seats are very small, the tables are rectangular, like in the dining room.
Pizza... well, if you haven't had it before, you'll like it. It seemed kind of faceless to me.
I didn't like the fact that the waiter was always standing behind you and almost always looking at the person in front of you.
We were uncomfortable.
The connoisseurs are delicious.
We won't be coming here anymore and I won't be recommending it to my friends.
Lena Grosscope is the best hair and makeup artist I've ever had.
She's very careful and she does everything with quality, I like to go to her, I know that everything will be done perfectly.
I only take my daughter to Lena's.
The atmosphere in the cabin is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We broke down on the way from the bottom, and the good people at Cut Resource came quickly to help!
Respect to you and prosperity, more such good people!
And the server's clean and fine!
We came to a concert by Sergei Chigrakov.
Great venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We'll definitely be there for the concerts this year.
A quiet place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, on weekends and holidays, live music!
The staff is nice and helpful!
There's a nursery.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I love this place ❤
The park is in the center of town, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there's room for both children and adults.
But the playground has been empty for a long time, just dust.
There's also a fenced football pitch, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there's more to our park.
A spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are some things that can only be bought at the Intersection.
The staff is friendly.
I've never been on bad food.
Often, there are promotions and discounts.
Glad to be close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We've been to the bar twice, and we love it, the staff is polite, the food is delicious, and most importantly, the music is great, and the DJs know their stuff.
The only, second time disappointing the lead singer of the band "Hands up Band".
Not only does she sing softly, but she also reads the lyrics of most songs from her phone, especially when it was the songs of the band "Hands up".
It doesn't make sense. (Playing in a bar, in a band)
We were on vacation in early March.
It's a nice hotel, with nice rooms.
For his birthday, they gave him a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Cleaning the room every day.
Replenish water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change towels.
Breakfast was a blast.
There's a minibar with crazy prices.
If you want to order in from the restaurant, you'll pay 20% extra for the room service.
The restaurant is a little overpriced.
I like it three plus.
The water park was included in the price of the accommodation.
The water park itself is not the best in Russia.
The masseuse was a bomb.
Everything is fine, but leaving is a bit disappointing: no goodbye, no good journey.
The doorman didn't even help me open the door when he saw the women with their bags and suitcases.
You gotta work on that to keep the brand.
It's a great place to get together with friends and get laid.
It's a big, comfortable steam room, with a pool, an outdoor pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh.
The workshop is on level!
In a short time, I've repaired three pairs of shoes (2 husband and 1 wife).
It's all right.
The quality of the work is at its highest.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
What a great basketball school!
My son is five months old and he loves it, he looks forward to every workout.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and soulful atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I order online myself.
Great location for a store.
Plus there's always discounts and excise, which is good too.
A good AV store is conveniently located, a large hall, a good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their help!
There's a cafeteria for several tables.
I'm here all the time, so it's all good!
This is a nice pool!
I'm talking about the frog, our coach Anastasia Vitalyovna is very much like the child and professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are hay bales!
I love the cupcake shop, the service, the croissants, the breakfast and the coffee always on the top.
But unfortunately, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, and the girls at the counter didn't even make coffee until I reminded them that they had, and it was impossible to drink, and it smelled and tasted like spoiled milk, and I decided not to finish it, and I just walked away.
Last time I had coffee, I had a long black hair, replaced.
Please pay attention, as I am not a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
The fancy eyebrows are here!
Victoria is a great adjustment, considering all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which will remove all the fur, and the eyebrows will look neat for a long time.
The color is selected by hair and skin type, which makes the paint last longer.
Better not do the eyebrows!
Thank you so much for arranging my mom's move!
Moving is always stressful, but your company was very clear, fast, and efficient.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I'll recommend your company to everyone I know!
It's all top notch.
We've been treating our teeth in Novodent for years.
Recently, my 8-year-old son had dental work done, and it went really well, and he's calm and ready to come back.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because you have to make an appointment.
I think the best stew in Tambov is here, I'm not a stew guy, but when you want something bad, here and here.
Delicious, fresh meat with lots of fillings.
And I don't know why, but it never runs on me.
Often when you finish the shaurma you don't eat the ni's because there's a lot of sauce and water... but not here.
That's why you guys are the best 🙂
Good teaching staff.
The food in the dining room is always fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various activities during the school year
Nice shop, polite staff, good selection.
The big downside, though, is that the goods that are brought in seem to be destroyed right in the mall.
Sometimes there's not much room to move between the rows and it's not very pleasant when the goods are directly on the floor without the pallets, but it's more of a comment to the organization than to the specific store
A wonderful example of Soviet architecture.
A stern magnificence that is tended to with care.
I enjoyed the concert twice as much, thanks in large part to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
As we waited in the lobby for the show to start, I had a very strong sense that I had come to the event, that this was really an outing.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I just happened to be on this online auto parts store.
Called, gave the PIN, said wait)
Ten minutes later, they called back, offered several options.
Since the personal-working machine didn't save and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
Five minutes later, they called back and said they had good news for you.
If you take not the whole basket + disk + withdrawal, but take LUK set basket + disk and separately withdrawal LUK, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
I took the clutch to the garage.
When the gearbox was removed, it was discovered that a flywheel was still needed, and the sooner the better.
I knew where to turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by phone (the first time I paid the same when receiving).
The next day, the flying machine was in my hands.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I'm happy that everything came quickly, that we went to the meeting.
I would definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop.
The New Year's Eve party was a success, but with a twist.
I booked a double, got stuck with a four.
But not trouble.
It's just weird that we didn't get a heads-up.
The kitchen's on four, the fish didn't work at all.
Leading with contests made at the school-level checkpoint, not very, to be honest.
But the music is perfect.
The atmosphere was high.
Everything else seems like a gimmick.
Thank you for the event.
I leave my feedback with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity home number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This facility is staffed by people who know and love their jobs, doctors and nurses by God.
Both in the OB/GYN, the OB/GYN, and the post-op.
But I would like to express my special thanks to E.Y. Kotlyarova, the head of the maternity ward on the fifth floor, and N.V. Yarantseva, the midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help in the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
This is a great store.
Big assortment of balloons, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, with always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We went to the establishment on recommendation.
The food was amazing, the program was lame, the waiters were a little cheeky, but we were in a great group with the kids and celebrating a big event, and it was friendly.
There was no fire pitch, the kids were waiting.
Good food is a safe bet.
