The July issue is traditionally handed over during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to read the stripes when the soul is torn for Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will tell you about MIFF next time (for now I will only complain that this year in the minds of the organizers the inexplicable idea that happy owners of purchased tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world sins in), and in this issue we report for what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the title character of the film "Predators" produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about "Inception" by Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman ..."), the most - without fools - the expected film of the summer.
And this time we publish the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here you certainly don't need to advertise anything specially, and it's a no brainer that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov,  Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant track record, was suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch her at all costs.
Cornered, she will repaint herself in the usual black and go to look for the truth herself.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal boy woman promises to further consolidate the position of the actress in the action genre.
She will arrange one accident after another, run along the walls a la "The Matrix" and scatter strong men in the same strict suits like children.
This is how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, dear, who blew up and repaired the world with the "Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And at the same time, all together turned out to be not a tedious American-type blockbuster about the salvation of mankind, but the cutest living carnival.
What did Besson do for 13 years between "Element ..." and "Adele..." I don't want to remember.
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this scriptwriting and producer fuss and rare, tortured directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." - hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that for 13 years in front of us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, a real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, sipped wine in a café opposite and composed a story about a charming adventurer.
To retell the plot (albeit in general terms), warming up expectations, in this case is more sinful than usual.
Here the whole incredible drive lies in the fact that surprises await you at every turn or replica.
And all as one pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADELE
The most dashing adventure movie of the decade hints that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele" will begin as "Amelie", rush towards <Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of comics by Jacques Tardy about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin before Adele starred in only three films.
The actress became famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for a César Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to evaluate special effects, scenery or tricks, but carries away, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: "Forward, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time, Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has seen enough of old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not denying oneself cynicism and not being embarrassed to take risks
DIRECTOR: Luc Besson
CAST: Louise Bourgousne, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Belle, Gilles Lelouch
PLOT: Strange things happened in Paris in 1912.
The city was disturbed by an ancient monster, which was awakened to life by an old medium.
The fossil creature is being chased by the police, as well as the famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much with the beast itself as with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
COMING JULY 22
"Adele..." is the case when parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it along a new path.
So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster action films, with the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (they made a bow to him here and ridiculed him), and finally, with the same "The Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film consists of verbal trickery, actor's clowning and plot balancing act (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is organic and stronger than ever).
A few words must be said about Adele herself.
It embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer, who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality as the purest courage and courage.
In the movies, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of macho or drag-eyed romantic
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer who only spins under his feet (only his knowledge of zoology is useful).
Therefore, an energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, completely sour, Luc Besson showed an unexpected creative dash, recalling that the border between the preferences of bored visitors to megamalls and highbrow regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Adventure movie game without sadness, fear and reproach
THE ROOM OF DEATH
A hermetic horror with a claim to psychologism and political context in 2002, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film was criticized, but the public liked it and made good money at the box office, and most importantly, caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director got into a factory forging new horrors according to old patterns: Bay set out to reshoot all the horror classics in the form of remakes and commissioned Liebesman with the prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
Criticism grimaced again, but the audience again liked it - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new scary", emphasizing the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, on his example, you can observe how the whole genre rushes about in convulsions, trying to invent new ways of influencing a jaded audience: the naturalistic blood of splatters merges with the catch-up of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without the liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut film "The Cube". The film was made by Michael Bay.
So in the "Death Room" Liebesman was forced to take a different path: a stupid massacre or monotonous running around from a maniac, he preferred a smarter option - almost without the notorious blood, but with a psychological game and riddles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with test subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to develop a survival strategy: unite in a team or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from the outside?
Or try to break your cage at all costs?
Not only they are tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is skilled in wild experiments.
SYNOPSIS: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given each a pile of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat comes into the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A survival game begins, with government agents closely watching behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for an outright arthouse
He can make small talk, and go with a fire extinguisher in the face, but he can't miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is circumspect and adamant in her sympathies.
She is wounded by her father's courtly lifestyle and openly peeps at how he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and her father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not at all the difference between generations or the choice of profession, it, one way or another, is already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan, together with Pavel Bardin, shot a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Three and a Snowflake".
The father of a maturing daughter in the comedy genre was convincingly portrayed by Depardieu
A fractional plot winds around the love affairs of the heroes, who talk about psychology all the time, and themselves, apparently, according to a witty director's find, focus on the language of sight and gesture.
Secondary plot branches (a girl crippled in a car accident, whom Alexei wants to marry, a drunk athlete performed by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are drawn only dotted.
I especially feel sorry for the line about the business of buying football players, which remained behind the scenes.
PLOT: More than anything else, the agent for the sale of football stars is worried about the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The compassionate dad himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy "with a core".
What is the disappointment of a businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the audience of the film, the author got "into the nine": "Do not look for a problem where there is none." You can't say more precisely.
Their similarity simply cannot fail to amaze.
In both tapes, there are detachments of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who framed them, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The characters jump to almost the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - and here and there something full of dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind of bucks descends on the scenery.
Even villains dressed in expensive costumes are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played in both cases by Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to shoot about dance battles - "The Brotherhood of Dance".
Chris Evans was recently invited to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that came out in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan was inspired by a comedy series of the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without saying a word, brought different material to an absolutely identical rumbling denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies that evoke a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out to be in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If we have to choose between these two tapes, then "Losers" look a little prettier and clearly more victorious in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who is very fond of the bazooka
CAST: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were framed by their own superiors: a helicopter with children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were considered dead from that second.
But they are alive - and intend at all costs to take revenge on the scoundrel with the languid voice that set it all up.
It's all cute, but honestly, it's worth spending an hour and a half of your life on White's painting only if you don't have any more interesting options at all.

A simple story about a runaway Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only these data in hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, the movie promises to be acutely social.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough.
There is a high probability of participation of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily take what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were lectured on Bresson in the early 80s
The film won the Grand Prix of the Jury at the Berlin IFF.
The script is based on the play by Andreea Valean, whose work is in great demand among the directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Cinematographer Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All of this is true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - don't get us wrong - it is not at all abusive, but recommendatory: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when the faith of its representatives in methods
of her work has not yet wavered.
And this moment must be seized: it is only thanks to this belief that one can endure an hour and a half spectacle of the Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pisteureanu (whose history, despite the abyss separating the two cultures, can easily be
convert into an exploration a la the 70s, with a cowboy who decided to take a walk from the prison, from where he will soon leave, to the nearest saloon).
CAST: Gheorg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: After trumpeting his four years, 18-year-old prisoner Silviu (Pistereanu) is soon to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the behavior of the young man becomes inadequate.
An affair with a social worker Anna further encourages the guy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the name of the picture.
What nonsense!
If you want to watch, look.
Not a bad debut, inspiring faint hope that a decent direction will someday grow out of the Romanian arthouse
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Coffin (Sop) and his co-author Renaud was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
"Despicable Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to look at the ZO), especially if you like it when different objects now and then strive to jump from the screen into the hall), tolerably written, and, most importantly, there is not a single lower-belt joke, because of which on the "Ice Ages" you had to shyly squeeze into a chair and cover children's ears with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the blatant asexuality of the protagonist, which in turn is dictated by the reluctance to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, a rather tough black humor is responsible (which, I would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
In general, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who have thought through every little thing so that all categories of citizens like the film.
Not that we want to see how the heroes of a children's cartoon will be eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion
PLOT: The big-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of astronautics over the years have been transformed into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to resort to the help of children to fulfill a great plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In some advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margot in glasses, Edith in a hat and Agnes, who is comparable only to the cat from "Shrek" in terms of lethal degree of affection.
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is copied from Christopher Meledandri - both of them are bald, nosed and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances the part of Travolta
A wheelbarrow rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a conditional desert, from which three pairs of the most solid boobs come out.
Quite so.
By themselves, the bearers of this gift are not so significant.
The camera confidently captures attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately inform you of the good news - the whole film is designed in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things in female beauty and the casting was carried out in such a way that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And there's a lot of funny stuff going on.
"Broker", "killer" and "stripper" dig in the sand, douse themselves with water (do not ask why), carry some kind of blizzard and periodically fight quite fiercely.
The creators believe that a motherly heifer with generous forms, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and teeth shining with whiteness is cool.
"Things" is primarily focused on classic sex plotting tapes.
Rick Jacobson filmed episodes of "Xena, the Warrior Queen" and "The Amazing Wanderings of Hercules."
A congenial film in the Moscow box office is "Trunk for Jennifer".
It's also cool when a beauty twists the balls of a bandit, a punk fights paired with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are attached to this; And the intrigue is unleashed through an infinite number of flashbacks.
In general, for a film fetishist, a real Klondike of pleasures is found here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang, filming this trash parody, had fun from the heart, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren't for the physical data of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from the night channel for adults (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
CAST: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hirst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring the leader of the mafia to the desert, who has diamonds hidden somewhere here for a substantial amount.
Having achieved nothing and shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to crumble, fight with each other and thugs periodically arriving from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and squeeze.
Along the way, it turns out that all three are not who they seemed to be at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even funnier.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest painting, "Judgment Day," the robbed "Mad Max" for the poor, Marshall misfired seriously
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shaken confidence.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus is not shy about a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious B-grade film aesthetics.
There is in the picture and hooligan courage of "Dogs-warriors", and bestial cruelty of "Descent".
The "Marshall Plan" to cleanse the "peplum" of the adhering post-gladiatorial film dirt, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His legionnaires covered with battle scars (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are stern men trying to marry their military duty with an irresistible desire to survive.
The murder and piquant details of the administration of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and thoroughness.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the introductory distribution in the German forests from the now reference "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason I absolutely do not want to try to convict Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
CAST: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost, where the centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) serves, is ruthlessly defeated by a reconnaissance company of the Picts.
Miraculously escaped, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, try to sneak away from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadist Itane (Kurylenko).
The thin arthouse actor has so far managed to win only sharply characteristic supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after "Centurion" the situation will change.
Peplum is a revised and supplemented edition.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and stern
Continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complex relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald boy-sorcerer, designed to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The lord of fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes an Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) knows how to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the dream of the object, it causes the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he will have to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there.
A picturesque lesson on managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds a young assistant in the hope of defeating an evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
With the help of destructive spells, they will arrange bedlam with dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
Bald as a billiard ball, the kitty has conceived the idea of taking over the whole world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second series of a furry family comedy.
Several inveterate thugs, led by the flimsy-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are hunted by stylish fanged aliens.
The return of the iconic character of the 80s to the big screen.
Look out for George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-now-director Anton Corbijn ("Control") for a very curious existential study of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly comprehending human nature.
"A visionary artist on the scale of Corbijn and a magnificent George Clooney is a film union made in heaven," the studio press release boasts.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney's life - with Italy: filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel "A Very Secretive Gentleman", Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the American in the title took the place of the English narrator, and the main character turned from an illegal gunsmith into a simple killer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack is trying to deal with his last case and finally quit the lucrative craft, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Ryten), with whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
"Jack tempts fate," reads the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be the one she claims to be.
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashen hair (the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will star in the film adaptation of Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front
Can I click you out of a photo gun!?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at the same time this season.
First, in Venice on the set of the thriller "The Tourist" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ("The Lives of Others").
There he plays a tourist in love with the heroine of Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico on the site of "The Rum Diary", an adaptation of the debut novel of the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson ("Withnail and Me"), whose last directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the domestic prison drama, there is no doubt about what inspired them.
But you can't approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, it's good at least that the heroine of the Russian picture, although a stranger, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects on their account: "Lucky Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't joke with Gohan!".
In July, the fifth comedy is released - "Classmates", in the work of the sixth - "The Pretender Wife" with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes the seventh film - the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will play Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughn, remembered by the viewer this year for the enchanting action movie "Kick-Ass", will reboot the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class," the director first of all called James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepathic Emma Frost, nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will be reincarnated as a blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While the shooting of the new James Bond series is postponed, its new director Sam Mendes does not have time to get bored.
On his to-do list is the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the film adaptation of Isan McUsene's novel "On the Shore".
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan is offered the main female role.
Gary Oldman examines the role of the practical Major George Smiley - the protagonist of John Le Caret's series of novels - in the film adaptation of the thriller Spy, Get Out!.
The first adaptation of this work in 1979 was played by Alec Guinness.
The new version will be shot by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer adapts David Mitchell's best-selling fantasy novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, this is not easy (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but extremely interesting work.
Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman have already received offers from him.
In the Crimea, the shooting of the international action movie Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune" is taking place.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went for their money to a real war in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The premiere of the film is scheduled for early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will play in the comedy "Baby Jesus" along with English pop star Pixie Lotg
Megan Fox fired from "Transformers 3"
According to Ragatoipe, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
Nevertheless, the place of the main character and the new lover of the hero Shia LaBeouf is likely to be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Wheatley.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she will have accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not frighten the sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful retraining of models as actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monstro"), Angelina Jolie ("Life Interrupted"), Jessica Lange ("Blue Sky", "Tootsie"), Kim Basinger ("Los Angeles Secrets"), Jennifer Connelly ("Mind Games"), Geena Davis ("The Accidental Tourist") and "First Runner-Up Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") began as models or starred for fashion magazines, eventually received a well-deserved Oscar.
Succeeded in acting (also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, what is especially nice, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
Their high awards are clearly at arm's length.
In short, Rosie has someone to take an example from.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who earned a Special Mention from the Cannes Jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone Will Die, but I Will Stay" and who directed the scandalous television series "School", received the position of creative director on the MT TV channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, it is already planned to shoot their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanika also began casting new presenters.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Freaks".
The main theme of the film remains the same - the provincial teacher of the Russian language Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to see the bride, but lingers to train the football team of street children.
The second storyline of the picture received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital's bride Nadia will be played by Milla Iovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third will appear - Nadia's ex-fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the yard team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in the filming of "The Hobbit" and the presence of a lot of side projects, Guillermo del Toro abandoned the position of director.
Studios are trying to persuade producer Peter Jackson to take matters completely into his own hands, but he is ready to agree to this step only in case of urgent need.
Possible successors include David Yeats, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose Jackson-produced film District 9 received an Oscar nomination.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Maddened by the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed at super speeds between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where press conferences and round tables flowed, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved to match - in almost everyone someone ran somewhere: confused Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Migrant Worker" and Dmitry Mamulia's "Another Sky" were looking for their missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "Live"
The same cops were happily circled around the finger by the hero of detective Klim Shipenko "Who am I?" - which, however, was remembered by the public rather for the presence in the frame of the totally naked Zhanna Friske.
There were heroes of domestic show business and in a couple of competitive films - in the film "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played a trucker carrying a circus animal for slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets speculated on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film production for two "Satisfaction", where business partners called each other to the alcoduel because of the lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr also bore a tangible imprint of the show - it was not boring at any of them.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian arthouse, Sergei Tolstikov, chairman of the Russian Cinema Support Fund, arranged a pictorial quarrel with critics: "Do you even read articles in the press that I read?" he menacingly asked the audience.
"I'm writing them," the president of ERVEZ replied confused! Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexei Fedorchenko's film "Oatmeal" was suddenly removed from the competition program - he would go to Venice: Mostra's selectors decided that the extra Russian screening was a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinotavr did not interfere with the giants - films from major festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film "My Happiness" participated in the competition, which competed with Mikhalkov and Weerasethakun on the Azure Beret in the spring.
Nikita Sergeevich at Kinotavr visited the film of the former Cannes competitor and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, did not like Loznitsa's picture at all - but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to give her a prize for directing.
The award for the best debut - "Missing" - was received by the daughter
A terrible film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naïve humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely choreographed, purifying film-experience, made by a misanthrope with a mathematical background, who calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls the films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the joy of the viewer is in the work of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult picture of "Kinotavr" has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - the director's star was born.
Impeccably dressed and tonsured programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the hole of a neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, an unfair hand of punitive bodies falls on the hero's head, and he begins a meaningless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's useful to work not only with debutants," producer Sabina Eremeeva triumphantly declared from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull the "inner debutant" out of the luminary of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - now in our cinema bison are moving after young people.
And not the other way around.
A documentary filmed in such a way that it blows your head cleaner than from a similar feature film.
The author is interested in a screwdriver that examines an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting through a cast-iron pan - all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover and her criminal brother into a real dock canvas with oil.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, tries on the black-and-white style of the French New Wave on the world of sleeping areas.
Let Godard's montage moves in the story of two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other of playing Bach backwards, look strange, but thank you for a rare attempt to poeticize the surrounding reality.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft such as An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24, equipped for the duration of the work with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological squibs with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process is as follows: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break" the clouds going to the city with these reagents. Particles of substances condense moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and exactly at the place where the impact on the cloud occurred.
For ten years, work has been underway on a remake of a science fiction film, in which Michael Iork played the main role.
Recently, Karl Rinsch was appointed director (he already has a remake of "Creatures from the Black Lagoon" in his schedule), famous for his commercials.
Previously, the names of Bryan Singer ("X-Men"), James McTeague (V stands for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski ("Tron: Legacy") were associated with the project.
In the story, the hero, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death penalty, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the rotoscopic fantasy cartoon of the 80s and plans to make a large-scale movie out of it.
The original was the fruit of the joint work of director Ralph Bakshi (film "The Lord of the Rings", 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of drawn tits.
In it, the warrior Larne saves Princess Tiger and all the people from the evil lord of the ice, Necron.
Rodriguez promises to pay attention to the creation of inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation soon, as 1 himself plans to do a remake of Dario Argento's classic giallo picture.
On the wide screens, the heroes will return none other than Michael Bay - the lord of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Daming Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and together filmed "Two Evil Looks" in 1990.
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing a script for it.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur"
"I wanted to bring more power to the female character to reflect the state of things in China," Chen says.
- Chinese women nowadays run big business and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies that power."
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
Is it an accident?
Regularity.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I was presenting two films here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE).
And in both I play a dream woman.
But... That's how the director saw me, that's how he introduced me, and many people probably think that I am like that in life.
Dream girl.
Your partner in the film, Alexander Yatsenko, is completely different from his hero.
How did you find a common language? What is he like on the court?
It is absolutely not what it seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, "Yes... It's not just that I'll have to."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded.
And we had this contact just a few minutes after we met.
We are great, I'm not afraid of this word, we became friends.
I told him about all my fears, about all my worries, about the fact that I was afraid that I would not succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and this help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere, we watched the whole film holding hands.
How was the shooting in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I never had a tour there, neither on vacation, nor as a child I did not come there.
This city has a special magic, some of its own character, its charisma.
And this is a city that you want to return to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always has time everywhere.
It turns out that it was easy for you to play love for this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which many, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you?
You know, I'm not a professional actor.
And I'm a very, by nature, gullible person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I, in fact, entrust myself in his hands and I want to be a dough from which they will sculpt.
I understand perfectly well that from the outside I know better, and I, again, ask for tips and talk with the director, for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and accurately what he needs.
And then, after long hours of rehearsals, we come to the organics that you are talking about.
And how did you work with the director of the film Klim Shipenko?
I got high from everyone, the cameraman, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because it's such a pleasure to work with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly such a situation.
Do not sleep, do not eat for days - and still, even thunder, even hail.
And if something didn't work out, it was a disaster, and something urgently needs to be done to make it happen.
In this atmosphere of madness, it is very easy to work.
And it seems to me that when people are so shifted to morbid fanaticism on what they are doing, it can't fail, because too much energy is expended.
What scenarios do you refuse?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you have to work with?
I don't want stupid things, stupid dialogues, films that don't say anything, don't carry anything.
I don't want to work for the sake of just appearing on the screen once again.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals and plans now.
I'm not the kind of person who paints charts.
The script came, I was interested in it, today this premiere happened.

GLASNOST BOOTH
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are almost continuously held in Moscow: American cinema - "Amfest", "2toggo", the other day "2-t-1" will begin, followed by the British Film Festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances constantly discuss that someone needs to be boycotted, and someone needs to be supported, for some - well, sorry - very vague reasons.
At the same time, when one of these festivals solemnly closes with a terrifying-looking Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The last thing you want to grumble about is this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall to look at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, then they will be shown to you.
And in the room, meanwhile, we have no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a continuation of the classic picture about virtual reality), "Let me in. The Saga (an American remake of a beautiful Swedish film), Uncontrollable (another of Tony Scott's approaches to trains) and a wildly detailed account of how the films of Conan, the barbarian, the destroyer and the governor were made.

A multi-part fairy tale about a cute bespectacled sorcerer is nearing completion.
And even though fans of the series have long read the book and know how it will end, and those to whom the word "Expelliarmus" does not mean anything, will remain at home, the title of the main blockbuster of November for Harry is actually booked.
By the way, the studios are also not fools: in order to stretch the audience's pleasure and finally squeeze the maximum out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the wizarding world of Hogwarts will stretch until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, embroiled five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
The starring Jesse Eisenberg is just as great as our conflicting genius, an emotionally isolated social exile with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of anger at the world around him, partly out of sporting interest, and partly simply because THIS is "cool".
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "The Social Network" become apparent from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) in less than five minutes: the sonorous, tough dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin are gaining momentum already here and do not soften until the very end.
It's the same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins, different actors played each other.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other with the help of computer graphics.
At the same time as Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara landed the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR: David Fincher
CAST: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ermy Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: Gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a turn from the gate on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few companion friends begin to deteriorate and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays a role: warm, sunny in places, even in the dark remaining cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate litigations.
Outside the flow of incessant discussions, there is not much going on in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to pull even an additional paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted the 49-year-old Sorkin and the 48-year-old Fincher to this story that is not too generous with details?
After viewing, there is a strong feeling that the "Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic device.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing about the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big things.
Now that the daily solvency has become even higher, the policy is no longer implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt by the fact that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevoss (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are stamping their feet: who said that the rich, beautiful and athletic can't be smart either?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, the "Social Network" could well turn out to be a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his business - positive or negative?
And what are the social consequences of its invention?
Is he a con artist?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of something like that.
But here it is not even required: in their version of history, it does not matter at all.
"How does it feel to feel beautiful?" asks Tre WeaNez's song "WaBu Uotz'te A Vsp Map", which precedes the credits.
The hero does not know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is part of a lost online generation that has little idea of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully made character drama about a high-profile internet era trial
At the beginning of the XVII century, when Ivan Susanin lived, the surnames of people of humble origin had not yet really begun to appear.
They managed with the naming "so-and-so, such-and-such a son."
That is, patronyms were in use - nicknames for his father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of remarriages of the father, they used the matronym - a nickname for the mother's name.
Susanin is just such a case: "Ivan, the son of Susanna."
The serfs of small landowners really did without surnames for a long time - why is it when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the XVIII century had surnames all without exception.
In the nineteenth century, even small landowners did not keep the peasant on the ground, but let him go on a dues - let him earn a craft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was supposed to have a passport, where he had to enter his surname.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released for rent.
So, they already had surnames.
Moscow forensic experts flew in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Forensic experts of the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the gas explosion in the house on Lineynaya, 39, the NGS reports.
According to investigators, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Yevgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictional organization Mezhregiongaz, examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked inaccurately, and the prices for their services, on the contrary, were overstated, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineinaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments of house No. 39, where they changed the hoses of the plates.
So, in one of the apartments, they put a water hose instead of a gas hose.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything has been certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a leak and explosion of the gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which killed 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, it was possible to avoid sea surge flooding
Arguments of the week.
St. Petersburg → Society

Specialists were able to prevent flooding thanks to the closure of the dam a day earlier.
On Friday in St. Petersburg, the threat of flooding increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
Sea surge flooding was prevented due to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd in a row, according to the St. Petersburg edition of Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but due to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water was kept at around 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters higher than the lower threshold of the level of dangerous flooding (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can again sail on the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that the situation with the water level is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This prevents flooding that may follow an increase in wind.
In Turkey, 8 people were arrested in the case of imperfections in collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with the discovery of construction defects in buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
As ARMENPRESS reports, Habertürk reports.
As a result of the earthquake recorded in Turkey on February 6, more than 20,000 people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7-magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks that were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, on Friday, an aerial bomb from the Second World War exploded, which sappers tried to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard tens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began on its neutralization.
Fortunately, all personnel are intact.
Agencies have begun to assess the damage," Norfolk Assistant Police Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

The explosion happened contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no dead or wounded
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the shores of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before trying to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective shaft of sand around it, and the cordon, inside which outsiders were not allowed, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
Explosives technicians at first, on Thursday, were going to cut off the fuse from the bomb with the help of a robot, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to the local press, to use the technique of "slow burning" of explosives.
In the process of this burning, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from the autumn of 1940 to the spring of 1941, known as the Blitz, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Women make up almost 40% of Belarusian researchers
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, BelTA learned from Alesya Solovey, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The proportion of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: women make up 41.1% of candidates of sciences and 21% of doctors of sciences.
In all fields of science, with the exception of technology, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized field of scientific knowledge is the medical sciences, in which 64.4 per cent are women.
Only in technical sciences are men predominant, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1%, which is 10.2% more than in the republic as a whole.
Among candidates of science, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of sciences - 20%.
More than half of the teaching staff in higher education institutions are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, one in three is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
Most of them are women among senior teachers and teachers - over 60%.
The proportion of women among associate professors in the departments is also high (55.2%).
According to the republican monitoring of public opinion conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree with the gender stereotype "science is a male sphere of activity" to one degree or another.
More than half of the country's inhabitants do not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation of gender ideas about women's research competence in the mass consciousness contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, and forming a successful role model of a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," said Alesya Solovey.
February 11 is the annual International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, encourage women to develop a scientific career and recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The probability of raising the key rate in the future is higher than lowering it
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have taken place recently.
On the one hand, the terms of foreign trade have deteriorated markedly - prices for Russian oil have decreased.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment slows down, but budget spending grows.
At the same time, proinflationary risks have generally increased.
"Therefore, this year the probability of raising the rate exceeds the probability of its reduction.
The expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," Nabiullina said.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, the rapid unwinding of consumption in the face of elevated inflation expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of workers and a lag in labor productivity growth from wage growth.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Governor of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not exclude the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its probability and scale have decreased.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some rate hike may be needed in order for inflation to meet the target of close to 4% in 2024," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual funds (mutual funds) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from the existing retail mutual funds.
This will make it possible to start the management of the remaining liquid assets and resume operations with investment shares.
If there are more than 10% of blocked securities in a retail mutual fund, then the management company must allocate them to a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be given shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets to a separate closed-end mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the case of the sale of such securities, management companies are required to pay at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment shares on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summing up the results of the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analytics and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia, passenger traffic in air transport decreased by 6.3%, and passenger traffic - by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and the passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the level of the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by state support programs.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by the Federal Tourism Agency.
Also, to ensure the availability of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and increase the capitalization of Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of subsidies to the industry by the state (25.3 billion rubles have been allocated so far) in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, to 103.0 million people," PSB analysts share their forecasts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Six more people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It was later revealed to be a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental problems, only this week he was discharged from the hospital.
Austria is again tightening controls on the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people remain at the border in cars waiting for it to cross to the Austrian side.
Thus, this becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already passed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
On the basis of existing arrangements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is required.
Vienna's decision to tighten inspections follows a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the commonwealth's borders.
According to Frontex, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status for the first time exceeded the figures for 2016 and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
Cargo "Progress 83" successfully docked to the ISS
The Progress 83 unmanned resupply spacecraft successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3.45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking took place at an altitude of 269 statutory miles above the South Pacific.
The docking was broadcast by NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Mission Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 was successfully launched from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported on the depressurization of Progress MS-21, prepared for undocking from the ISS and further flooding on February 18.
According to the press service of the company, the transfer hatch of the ship was immediately closed: Progress MS-21 is isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
Also, the MCC reported that the ISS crew is not in danger: "The temperature and pressure on board the station are normal.
Nothing threatens the life and health of the crew, they feel good."
"Cases of maternity tourism have become more frequent."
How pregnant Russian women are stuck in Argentina
The Argentine Migration Service began to suspend and cancel the residence permit of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not stay in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic refused entry into the country to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of arriving for the purpose of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were nevertheless allowed to enter Argentina by a court decision.
For more details, see the article "Newspapers. Ru".
The Argentine Migration Service began to suspend and cancel the residence permit (residence permit) of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not stay in the country.
This was told to the C5N TV channel by the director of the service, Florencia Carignano.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to obtain a residence permit because their child is Argentine, but at the same time spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the court considers the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came again."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left may have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to the refusal to enter the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polina, the diplomatic mission connects the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls at the entrance to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, two more on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three were issued an order to prevent them from entering the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the law on migration, where one of the grounds for non-admission to the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the migration service of Argentina, by a court decision, allowed pregnant citizens of the Russian Federation to enter the country, lawyer Christian Rubilar said.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quoted him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows you to make short-term trips to 171 countries without visas, including the EU, Great Britain and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about a "boom in maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russians who are going to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could rise to 10 thousand", he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that in 2022 about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how rental prices in St. Petersburg have changed.
It fell by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that throughout the country, rent has become more expensive by 25%, reports the Patrol of St. Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
Odnushka cost 25,000 rubles per month, studio - 22,000 rubles per month, two-room - 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country became known.
The Argentine Migration Service did not allow six pregnant Russian women into the country, as the purpose of the visit, which was indicated by them, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the Todo Noticias TV channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them confessed that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not let the Russians into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is 33 weeks pregnant, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly tell about where she will go on vacation, then suspicions from the migration service immediately fall on her.
Moreover, experts specify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions."
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
Laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation Alexander Filippenko said that the decision of the Mossovet Theater not to renew the contract with him was planned, in addition, everything was agreed in advance with the management.
He said this in an interview with the Interfax agency.

The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that back in 2022 his contract ended.
All the details have long been agreed with the representatives of the theater.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew the contract.
Filippenko noted that the authorities went to a meeting and prepared all the documents.
So, he assures that "he did not let anyone down."
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is going to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, at the moment the actor in the Moscow theater works as a guest actor.

On Friday, the tenth of February, 340 thousand cubic meters of snow were removed from the territories of the private sector in the Kalinin Autonomous Region.
This information was shared in the mayor's office.
At the moment, there are more than four hundred streets of the private sector in the Kalinin district, from which it is necessary to remove snow by spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first will end on the fifteenth of February, and the second will be held from the first of March to the fifteenth of April.
114 units of special equipment and 123 workers will take part in the cleaning.
Authorities reported that contractors are faced with the removal of snow on the roadway by residents of houses.
Kirkorov won the court against the fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man declared the illegality of the construction of the artist, but did not appear at the meeting.
The fisherman sued the musical performer Philip Kirkorov because of the allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha near Moscow.
Writes about it "Channel Five".
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, the court presented documents, design projects that confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's house.
As the head of the law firm Alexander Dobrovinskoy clarifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff a chance to go fishing.
The application for the contractor was submitted on January 11.
The star lawyer jokingly said that, probably, the man planned to fish exclusively from the artist's house.
Ironically, Dobrovinskoy clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He stressed that from that place there is an opportunity to spinning further.
The somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Somnologist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As noted by the specialist, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
First of all, we are talking about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, because they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "torn", which means that they do not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop using caffeinated products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they help to reduce the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, there are difficulties with falling asleep.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent nocturnal awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends abandoning spicy food in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy foods contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to comply with the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not necessary to abuse heavy food before going to bed, since it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also recalled that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and habitual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to sleep and rest and allow the body to recover.

Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, according to French media.

Depressurization of Progress MS-21 occurred on the ISS: 12 February 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos announced the depressurization of Progress MS-21, prepared for undocking from the ISS, Kazinform reports with reference to TASS.
"The contour of the Progress MS-21 cargo transport spacecraft, the sinking of which is scheduled for February 18, has been depressurized, the telemetry data received by the MCC was confirmed," the Roscosmos press service said.
As noted, at the moment it is isolated from the total volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, it did not affect either the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo spacecraft or the further ISS flight program.
The situation was commented on by the executive director of Roscosmos for manned space programs Sergey Krikalev.
"On the cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months, there was a leak of coolant from the thermal control system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to us with the ship (Soyuz MS-22 - approx. TASS) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission, which analyzed the incident with the Soyuz, came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to make sure there are no problems with the next launches.
"We need to conduct an in-depth analysis to make sure that this reason does not apply to similar designs on future launches.
This is the most important task that will now face us," he said.
According to the executive director, it is necessary to conduct an analysis from the point of view of preparing the ship for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," Krikalev added.
The executive director said that on Saturday the commission began its work, which will analyze all possible causes.
"The ship was supposed to be undocked and de-orbited two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz MS-23 - approx. TASS), therefore, serious consequences for the actions of the crew, for the work of the crew ... From this point of view, this will not affect the program," Krikalev said.
The Progress MS-21 truck was launched from Baikonur on the Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the Poisk small research module of the ISS Russian Segment.
The spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA called the place of depressurization of "Progress"
The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo spacecraft on the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was announced by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, the broadcast was conducted by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from the Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant is completely out.
"This morning we had a refrigerant leak from the thermoregulation system into space, the refrigerant leak stopped," said a representative of the American MCC (quoted by Interfax).
Previously, due to depressurization, the Progress circuit was isolated.
Roscosmos reported that nothing threatens the cosmonauts.
Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, and will be de-orbited, according to the plan, on February 18.
John Kirby, coordinator of strategic communications at the US National Security Council, refused to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.

The head of the city of Serpukhov Sergey Nikitenko made a working detour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the maintenance of apartment buildings and residential buildings.
The addresses from which the most appeals from residents came from were under the strictest control.
- Many of the comments are quite justified and concern, first of all, the cleaning of entrances and the maintenance of common areas.

Deputy Director General of Russian Railways invited the Governor of the Irkutsk region to develop new sales areas
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to develop alternative sales directions, except for the Far East.
This is both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by Deputy Director General of Russian Railways Alexei Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year showed, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "subcontractors" (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal price conditions for the transportation of their products according to new schemes, - said Alexey Shilo.
The Governor noted the importance of the stability of the shipment of products, the Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions of the Russian Federation in mineral resources and has significant reserves of coal and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of the shipment of products for export has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to provide support in terms of traffic volumes.
If there are additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market, then we are also ready to assist in this area," said Alexei Shilo.

Therefore, sellers sometimes arbitrarily connect houses to nearby networks, and this is the basis for turning off the power supply.
Therefore, now grid companies in those territories where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue," Konstantin Zaitsev emphasized.

The crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alijan border crossing point on the border of Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
This is written by the Turkish and Armenian media.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, the Turkish Anadolu Agency notes.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency packages to the city of Adıyaman in southern Turkey, Ankara's special representative for the Armenian-Turkish talks, Serdar Kılıç, said.
He expressed gratitude to the Deputy Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Foreign Minister of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the assistance sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-hit region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vahan Hunanyan, in turn, said that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border across the Margara bridge and are heading to the region affected by the earthquake.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu Agency cites other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border checkpoint was last used to deliver humanitarian supplies to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
At that time, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria in the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, more than 25,000 people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that struck on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on February 11 that 21,848 people were already known to have died in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are overshadowed mainly by Ankara's refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for third-country nationals as soon as possible.

A tanker with a diesel engine from a ship that previously sailed under the Russian flag was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Spanish Ministry of Transport has banned the Maersk Magellan vessel from entering the port of the city to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport said.
"The Maritime Command of Tarragona of the General Directorate of the Merchant Marine under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has banned entry into the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel on the Singapore-flagged Maersk Magellan, because the cargo it carries comes from the Cameroonian-flagged vessel Nobel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with EU law, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag since April 16, 2022 or changed flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which a ban was agreed.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships are prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Maltese-flagged Black Star vessel, which was carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel, was denied access in the port of Barcelona.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, the United States and the United Kingdom imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.

The problems that arose among pregnant Russian women with entry into Argentina were explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of an influx of people wishing to have a child in Argentina, the country's authorities began to more closely monitor the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
Reports about it "Lenta.ru" with reference to Professor of St. Petersburg State University Viktor Heifetz, editor-in-chief of the journal "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transit point, and not into a final one.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision to grant an Argentine passport to parents after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, citizenship may be refused.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by "right of soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens up the possibility for visa-free visits to 170 countries, including the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke the residence permit of Russians who received a document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the motives for the trip.
In Russia, predict the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs
In Russia, the interest of citizens in fitness services is recovering, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mostly small-format ones, may open in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, at the same time, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-format projects with a small initial investment and a quick payback.
Such data are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
Olga Kiseleva, President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, in an interview with the publication, noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, there have been more club closures than openings every year.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts cite other figures.
According to Kontur.Focus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main activity "fitness center work" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but back in 2021 it began to recover.
According to 2GIS, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over one million.
Russians began to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
At the end of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, then by the end of the year the industry will return to pre-crisis levels.
The license of the management company from Kirov was taken away
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region revoked the license to carry out entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, by decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license to carry out entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings, previously issued to the management company Zabota, was canceled.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but entered into force only in February 2023.
The arbitration deprived the "manager" of the license for the fact that the organization several times ignored the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all objects that were managed by Zabota have been excluded from the register of licenses for entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The fact that they were left without a management company, the Kirov administration knows.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor's office about the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set the task for the employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to liquidate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, since there are too many of them.
The legitimacy of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov Communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could be taken in the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The antimonopoly authorities allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.

Opening hours are from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
In the store you can drink coffee and have a snack with fresh pastries.
There is a small parking lot from the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a large selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh pastries😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Comfortable cafeteria area
We came with my daughter and applied for a pension.
They received cordially, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, issued an application, told how to make an appointment for subsequent appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and security are greeted culturally, respectfully.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although it would not hurt to buy a cooler with water.
We came 2 times, everything is fine!
I wish all employees peace, goodness, good luck and a decent salary, in this difficult time for everyone!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine waiting for a scallop salad (which tastes simply incomparable!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!)))
A nice cashier asked me to go with her or in the hall to make me coffee, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
After a couple of minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to be in ceramics, that's why I wanted to be in the hall.
They did it to me.
I ask why in a cup and not in a cup.
The girl answers, they say, they do not have 300 ml cups.
That's how it fits in a person's head?
Ask with yourself or in the hall, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
Get an answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Clarify the volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
Put a person in front of the fact that there are no cups of such a volume.
Here, they say, a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in the Green Outskirts in my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I wanted. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. The cafeteria of the Green Outskirts and the Green Outskirts - are the sides of the same coin or organization in no way connected with each other?
If not related, there is understanding.
If related, why did a food and trading enterprise, known in the city for its service and quality, condescend to the rhetoric of a stall at the Kazan railway station?
Rhetoric because such a case, I repeat, has happened to me for the third time.
I don't rule out that it's not just me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she was acting on a whim.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please describe the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to enter the service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw the numbers with Nikulin Y. himself.
And now with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, the programs too.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
From almost any point you can see the arena and the backs of those sitting in front of you do not interfere with you.
The circus is very intimate, family!
this time we went to the New Year's program.
A little upset.
A lot of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can't take pictures with animals in the foyer.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And in general, a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and delight us with your numbers!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to see the complex, when there were not even walls yet, so that you could see everything live, although how many apartments we considered and not a single developer offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The most thrill is the gentle sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks, as for me, are boring and short.
The longest are in sector e, there is even less.
But in general, a great atmosphere, many different cafes and bars, so a cheerful ski mood is guaranteed!
Excellent master Peri!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the cabin is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a wardrobe and water.
Disgusting service.
For the second time, I come for an order by the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application, and I wait at the windowsill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today, such a service is unacceptable in business!
The answer of the "care" service is that we are trying.
At the checkout, even without apology, just - we are not to blame, this is a program.
You did not find any other technical means of communication with regular previously loyal customers.
Impotent people are "trying", but business must work.
Thank you all, we all disagree.
We will not order more from you and even more recommend it.
Spoiled mood, waiting for guests, apologies from the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
I expected to receive the car in 3-3,5 months (as agreed), but in fact it turned out to be 4,5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania performed).
As a result, I am very pleased with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in contact, up-to-date information, professional advice and a normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge are available.
Of the shortcomings, one can single out too little space, there is a terribly small shower in the bathroom.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry things, I had to take a dryer from the owners and shove it instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
And so, in general, a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There are wines and beers for those wishing to drink.
The center of Moscow, I recommend
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
All the necessary amenities are available on site, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good repair and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I liked it very much, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov Park and landscape.
In winter, there are many slides that are natural for children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly buy here, the prices are low, and the quality is at the level!
Very responsive staff, will prompt and answer all your questions)
I recommend this store to everyone! ❤️
The location is as convenient as anyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They serve quickly, if one of the visitors is not stupid.
It is convenient by appointment.
The staff is attentive, prompted, directed, consulted, even if they did not come on reception days.
In principle, it is normal.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was quickly done, the prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought the remote control was thrown away, but they did everything to me.
Many thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery of 2 hours on March 8.
After 6 hours, they brought flowers in a package, as if they had stolen them (there is barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the site and the color turned out to be completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count and it turned out that there were an even number of tulips of 20 pieces.
Support in WhatsApp to my indignation about the color and the number of colors replied "apparently confused the color."
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of arrogance and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office about the fact that they refused to give me a check.
Next in line are Rospotrebnadzor and the court.
I do not recommend anyone to contact this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to the master Samira, for dyeing and cutting hair.
I want to cancel the professionalism of Master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always happy with her work.
She always listens carefully to the wishes of the client, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I boldly recommend this master to all relatives and friends.
All her works are always made at the highest level !!'
A huge thank you to Master Samira 😍
Greetings I was in this gaming club, I can say the prices are excellent, there are a lot of gaming computers, there are also drinks and food.
Of the minuses, some keyboards are broken, buttons fly off, if you take the "normal gameplay", then the computers do not pull well :(
Therefore, a score of 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
My son goes to study in his group, and my mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, the coaches are professional.
They arrange themed holidays for children, monitor cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and study.
A 6-year-old child already holds a blow well, a strong general physical condition.
Recommended for children, moms and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
The work is done qualitatively, caring, clarifies everything.
You can always talk to girls about something!
The third time was!
I will never regret it!
I can finally grow my hair back after lightening !!
Vita also studies coloristics.
Therefore, it is she who will soon be able to combine blon with keratin!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰 to you
Master receiver Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, she clearly explained everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
Also, during the repair of my car, she provided all kinds of assistance.
And also thanks to the master Valery Ushakov for the attentive and professional work.
I was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out qualitatively.
The only thing that confused me when recording for maintenance was insufficiently correct information on the work regulations, when appearing at the maintenance, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
It took a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve the real estate transaction, the employees were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, although they could refuse, since this is not part of their duties.
Thank you very much!
Very sincere people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, I did not regret that I came to this particular hairdresser! 👍
Master Nahida made an impeccable highlight, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend❤️ it to everyone
I really liked it in the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It has been restored for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on an excursion, it's also great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
We have known Olya for more than 3 years, we use the services regularly.
During this time, we saw how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged animals, which only causes admiration and trust.
We always leave our dog with peace of mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be picked up / taken away by zootaxi.
And they will also bring clean and tasty)
In general, a 🥰 fairy tale
Thank you for your care and attentive personal attitude to our pets 🐕💜
The Syty Elk restaurant is located next to the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
Delicious dishes are prepared.
The menu is varied.
Before visiting, it is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
Cute well-kept zoo.
Smaller than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
There were on weekdays - an adult entrance 300 rubles, a schoolboy 170.
There were few people, we walked with pleasure, looked at the animals.
The anteater impressed)
in Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
On the territory there are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, the toilet is clean and free, we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend 👍
The salon is at the highest level!!
I am very pleased with the services of cosmetologist Natalia Kuznetsova, I go only to her.
I do various facial cleansings - both hardware and mechanical.
100% satisfied.
A master of his craft👍
Everything tells in detail about the features of the skin, I picked up cosmetics that care for my skin type, just perfect.
Now I go happy and beautiful!!
Thank you Natalia!!
A great club with a huge space, a swimming pool, a sauna, a hammam and great trainers!
Of the minuses, there are a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club like a public bath!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting from 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I put a three, and then only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken Timur, but I could be wrong.
He arranged everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything was intelligible, the son also decided to issue a card, and alas, the consultants are busy with their own affairs, the clients are waiting, the consultant approached the son in the end, to whom everything is up to the light bulb, several times he opened 6 to the meeting room, discussing something cheerfully, as a result, the son left without issuing anything, the consultant said for forgiveness, well, you don't want it, as you want, since I was present at this meeting,  I was surprised.
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It is a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to the appearance of pellets), the staff knows its assortment, help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim girl and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are located near the metro, there is even a small parking lot.
Recommend!
I was in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I liked everything in terms of service and quality of food: the prices are low, the portions are medium-sized, so you can eat, or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of the table.
When I ordered, I indicated the number and everything that was required, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone.
Then nothing.
When I came to the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been booked.
We were lucky that there were free seats and we were able to accommodate.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
Recommend!
Went for a cleanse this recent weekend.
For the first time I see such an organized staff who treated many of my questions as reverently as possible, suggested how and what is best done for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I heartily recommend, the only clinic where they do not want to heat up with money in my memory.
Nice shopping center.
There is everything!
A large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
More in this store not a foot.
We bought a washing machine, they said that we were out of town, so we'll take it ourselves.
The manager in the hall said where to drive up to the warehouse, to the question "loaded"? He said yes. ))
they took it out in the warehouse without a box, to the question why? They replied that this is how everyone loads.
When I began to insist, they thrust two strips of foam, like it will do!
They refused to load it into the trailer, they say it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery)))
When I said that then I would refuse the order altogether, they said "yes, as you want, we don't care", as a result, one still condescended to go down the ramp and help my father stuff the car into the trailer.
This is the first time I have encountered such boorish service.
Nice shopping center Clean neat.large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic", an entertainment children's center "Nevidalia".
On the ground floor there is a large Hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking, convenient location.
A good supermarket of cosmetics, underwear and household goods.
A diverse assortment, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, advise.
Everyone will find something for themselves.
A good place to spend the evening.
The staff is very good, a nice place.
I advise everyone never make a mistake in choosing.The best institution in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be super.
I advise you to visit)
We express our gratitude to the Sentry Marina, who was our agent for the organization of the funeral.
Coming to us on call, she took care of all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was in touch all the time and informed how things were going.
Thanks to her, we saw off a loved one with dignity.
Everything was framed, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, well aware of the condition of her loved ones, gave advice on how it would be better and simply sympathized with us in a human way.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Flattered by the many good reviews, I turned to "RemStirMash" and I was appointed master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for service.
Everything was discussed and the time was set - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complex application (how's that? but where is "completely free?") and, if he can, then instead of the appointed 14.00 he will appear after 18.00.
We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander he can come, but after 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all the planned things on the side!
In short, the sensible master Ivan arrived, repaired the breakdown, for which he is thankful.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and don't waste your time.
Evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
At first there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then they looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, the children climbed to look several times, the adults crowded and could not let others look.
The objects we looked at through the telescope were the size of an ordinary star, and without a telescope you can see it for free.
The girl answered the questions not very accessible, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear for what 600r.
The stunning place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
Sit, eating 2-3 dishes for two (portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequila, for example, I highly recommend trying Macho Boracho.
The price is 420 rubles for 0.5 liters.
And in general, the restaurant itself has very tasty cuisine, I don't know about others, but I really liked it, I will advise my friends to definitely go there)
Excellent store, I have been buying goods from them for a long time, since the very opening.
Good quality products.
I bought a faucet, five years have passed, and it works properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when they made global repairs in the apartment, they took everything they needed here.
Excellent refueling!!
It is located very conveniently, there is also a guard of the center and the side of the region, in general it is convenient)!
The gas quality is good, I have been refueling 2 times a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is excellent!!
Eaglets on the card and for cash, on the displacement do not deceive.
Shop, I liked it!
You can choose any model, at a reasonable price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help in choosing.
I took a laptop for my daughter, for study, because her laptop was covered.
Helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! 👍
A sommelier works.
He helped with the choice of wine, because such a large menu is difficult to figure out on your own.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting, charming Vasily, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
I ate pike perch - magically, respect to the cook.
The children's menu is the same as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. Mine ate pizza, it's FIRE here!
Adults appreciated the truffle, and the children with ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling, friendly.
We liked it.
The brand-new WB pick-up point is conveniently located.
Working hours, from 10.00 to 21.00, seven days a week and holidays.
There are fitting rooms inside the pick-up point.
Very nice place.
It employs real professionals who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast issuance.
I am glad that the product can be immediately viewed and tried on.
It's great to be close to home.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that is stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient check-in, private parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
Wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different performances.
Today we were at the play "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, this is the best of children's performances.
It was very interesting, a lot of puppets, special effects.
Even the son of 14 years old, went just for the company, and said that it was a very good performance.
My husband and I rested for 10 days in January 2023.
The rest was a success on "5", I liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called, clarified at what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price is 850 rubles), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us go behind the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, it was issued quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator - this is a big plus!
The 2-bed room is spacious, the floors in the room and in the bathroom are warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two armchairs), panoramic windows (in the 5th building).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in the 5th building.
Everything is clean, change towels and linen at your request, but if you do not ask to change, you still change it on the 4th day, the linen is of good quality.
The territory is well-groomed, everywhere there are benches, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus takes you to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
The public transport stop is 5 minutes away.
In the dining room, friendly guys will always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but then whoever goes for what, everything suited us perfectly, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and meatballs or the like, vegetables for a side dish every day, the pastries are delicious, more than 4 drinks, coffee cereals, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, but cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 ° C, the sun.
We liked everything, really rested.
There is a desire to come again and it is in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the pool will not be put into operation and the training complex.
Thanks to the entire staff of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Flight" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She likes everything very much, the coach praises) this is the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I would never have thought that my daughter was so flexible!
Wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to look into this promising institution - and we did not lose!
Prices are very affordable, and incredibly delicious pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, not even a crust remains.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend :)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarov hospital with pressure and a high heartbeat.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
The food is childish, but excellent!!
I was surprised that at 7 in the morning they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, every single one of them gives both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!
While there is a dropper, they will come in, ask about their well-being ...
Previously, I had a chance to do an ultrasound of the heart, but for the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Claudia Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, competent, gives an exhaustive answer to any question; I picked up the dosage and medications, from which both blood pressure and heartbeat normalized, which I could not previously achieve after contacting other doctors.
Thank you very much to the head physician Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the well-coordinated work of the hospital!!
Thanks to the medical staff, nurses, and thieves!
When you visit the customer service, the impression was good.
In the lobby I met the administrator.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently help customers with all questions asked.
The specialist assisted in submitting the application and gave explanations on my question.
For a small store, a very good selection of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, chemicals for the home, various trifles.
It works around the clock, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It's cool when there is a place in the city where you can ride from the mountains.
The lifts are a rope tow and on weekends, of course, the queue gathers for 40 seconds descent and 5-10 minutes queue.
But in general, it's cool, immersion in an atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if there is dirt and dampness on the roads.
I turned to the service to repair the iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted directly with the master Alexander, who explained all the subtleties of the repair and immediately outlined the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done quality.
The masters are very pleasant in communication, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was touched, the focus was lost.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected in the shortest possible time, everything works properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to conduct a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are reasonable, have.
If you need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Scalable, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires close, prompt and high-quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the owners
Excellent w/c
Responsive concierges, garbage is cleaned, clean and beautiful on site, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We opened a good, cozy place to relax in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
A killer and varied food court.
Tables are located in cozy areas.
There is no crowding.
Well, we visited, tried ...
The interior has nothing to do with an Italian cozy café ...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in the dining room.
Pizza... Well, who has not tasted tastier, he will like it, it seemed to me some kind of faceless.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter is standing behind you all the time and your interlocutor opposite almost always looks in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We won't come here again and I won't recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best master I've ever cut my hair and dyeed.
She does everything very carefully and efficiently, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also take my daughter only to Lena.
The atmosphere of the cabin is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We are from Nizhny, we broke down on the way, kind people from KatResurs quickly responded and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, there would be more such good people!
And in the service there is clean and good!
We came to the concert of Sergei Chigrakov.
Great concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come this year for the planned concerts.
A quiet place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music plays on weekends and holidays!
The staff is nice and helpful!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I love this place ❤
The park is in the center of the city, very easy to reach.
The park is clean, there is a place for both children and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, understandable layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is welcoming.
I didn't get into bad products.
Often promotions and discounts.
I am glad that it is close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We were in the bar twice, I liked everything, polite staff, delicious dishes and most importantly - great music, DJs know their business.
The only thing that disappoints the second time is the soloist of the group "Hands Up Band".
Not only does he sing to put it mildly not very much, but he also reads the lyrics of most of the songs from the phone, it was especially striking when these were the songs of the group "Hands Up".
Somehow this is illogical (performing in the bar Hands Up, in the group Hands Up Band).
We rested in early March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of the birthday, they gave a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
Breakfasts are just a dump of the head.
There is a mini bar with insane prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant to the room, pay 20% service on top.
In the restaurant, prices are slightly overpriced.
To taste for three plus.
The water park was included in the price.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance did not even help open the door, seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
This needs to be worked on in order to keep the brand.
A great place to get together with friends for a steam bath.
A large and comfortable steam room, billiards, an open-air pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
The workshop is on the level!
In a short time, I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husband and 1 wife).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is at its best.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful basketball school!
My son has been walking for 5 months and he really likes it, he looks forward to every workout.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and sincere atmosphere.
The store is excellent, the staff will go, I order via the Internet myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
A good AB store is a convenient location, a large hall, a good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
Often I happen - everything suits me!
Nice pool!
I'm specifically talking about the "frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalievna really likes the child and is professional !!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are hair dryers!
I love the bakery cupcake, the service, the croissants, the breakfasts and the coffee are always on top.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout did not make coffee until I reminded them, they did, it is impossible to drink, it stinks and the aftertaste of spoiled milk remains, I decided not to finish drinking and just left.
Last time my coffee had long black hair, replaced.
Please be careful, after all, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria perfectly corrects, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of both hair and skin, so that the paint lasts a long time.
You can't make eyebrows better!
Thank you very much for the organized move of my mother!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is at the highest level.
For a long time we have been treating teeth with the whole family in Novodent.
Recently, the teeth of an 8-year-old son were treated, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because reception by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I'm not a fan of shawarma, BUT when you want something harmful only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat, lots of filling.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows with me.
Often, when you finish the shawarma, you don't eat the bottom, because there is a bunch of sauce, water, well, in short, fuuuu ...., but not here.
Therefore, you guys are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
In the dining room, they always feed fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held during the school year
Nice shop, polite staff, good assortment.
However, a big minus is that the goods that are brought, apparently, are destroyed right on the trading floor.
Sometimes there is little space to pass between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are directly on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a remark to the organization, and not to a specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict splendor, which is reverently cared for.
I got double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the house of culture.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that it was really going out.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
Quite by accident I got into this online auto parts store.
I called, indicated the vincode, they said wait)
After about 10 minutes, they called back and offered several options.
Since the car did not save personally-working and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
After another 5 minutes, they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you do not take the whole basket + disc + squeeze, but take the LUK set basket + disc and separately squeeze LUK, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
After picking up the clutch, I went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it was found that a flywheel was still needed and the faster, the better.
I already knew where I would turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by call (for the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The next day, the flywheel was on hand.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I am pleased that everything came quickly, that we went to a meeting.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a success, but with nuances.
I booked a double table, it turned out that they put me at a 4-seater.
But it doesn't matter.
It's just strange that they didn't warn.
The kitchen is four, the fish did not succeed at all.
The presenter with competitions made at the school-level power point, to be honest, not very much.
BUT when it comes to music, everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was top-notch.
Everything else seems to be nitpicking.
Thank you for the event
I leave my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This institution employs only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OPB department and in the maternity ward, and in the department after childbirth.
But I express special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Y., this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., this is a midwife in the maternity department, thank you very much for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Lovely shop.
A large assortment of balls, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, with always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the institution on the recommendation.
The food is amazing, there is no program, the waiters are a little cheeky, but we were in a great line-up with the children and celebrated an important event, we were friendly.
There was no fiery supply of the plateau, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for good cuisine.
