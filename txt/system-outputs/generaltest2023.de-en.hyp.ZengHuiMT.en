Geesthacht: New bed signs are intended to encourage replanting.
Franko Stein( FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe( Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blooms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is an action of Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, businesses and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth since 2015, with the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, businesses and institutions. Goal: In the Geesthachter city area, flowering islands are to be created over a wide area, on which insects can find food at any time. "When the weather is favourable, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food, " says Friedhelm Ringe of Nabu in Geesthacht, saying. He himself has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the undertaking does not remain only an action by nature conservationists and the city's environmental service, but also draws wide circles into private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed on the plants. So far, there are about 50 signs. Passers-by should be able to find out in this way what is blooming so beautifully here right now. The hope is that amateur gardeners will replant at home in a targeted manner.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started already at the start of the season.
More recent dates are shrubs such as winter scented hedge cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the bucket on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given further signs. "The winter scented hedge cherry is a very broad bushy shrub and can become between two meters high and three meters wide, " can be read there under further information, for example, about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that, however, it is not only the bedding plants that now show flowers that do not only show flowers. In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started already at the start of the season. It blooms particularly lushly on the Richtweg at the incline, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of them if he looked down from the sky at Munich's Ostbahnhof.

Wikipedia: The tap dance took place in the 19th century. Developed in the U.S. in the century and is now known everywhere in the world. With two metal plates each, more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing that fit the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is noisy tap dance and the French Claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.

Analogue in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital One.
As digitization progresses, the desire for analogue is growing again for some.
According to DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick, the speed with which our everyday lives became digital hardly gave us time to set up rules for dealing with them and to adapt our methods of communication and work accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden broke out with Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either one belonged to the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or one belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call the relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or they were looking for a phone booth or looking for a phone booth. Unforgettable the smell of the plastic piece and the click of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when I called  video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be like.
As in Moldova, so on. 14 days for a new government

The 48-year-old business expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president’ s advisors.

The president thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is a neighbor of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS ( Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular, with support from the Kremlin - becoming more popular.

The biathlon icon, which is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Cup gold medals.

Meanwhile, nothing ran together with Doll again. After the veteran had missed all chances of a medal at the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there had been only sixth place, things didn't go any better three days later, three days later.

Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will focus on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test, " Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington, D.C., saying. “ We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength.” Lula replied with a view to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: “ Brazil has isolated itself for four years”,
Left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. On the 1st In January, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by heavy riots. Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the U.S. Capitol just over two years ago, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently invaded parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much attention to international relations. ‘ His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening,’ said Lula, Lula. "I think I know, " Biden replied  an obvious reference to his predecessor in office, Trump.
Short note about the press- the Friday.
Someone still remembers the RAF wanted posters. It showed the members of the Red Army Faction released for denunciation and shooting down.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public sentiment was created against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. ( Nothing here about the really dangerous stuff in pinstripe suits and ties )
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more after Raudis in the S-Bahn or onanists in the park, is giving a new edition with the" war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world there are perhaps more "Russian friends" to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, but: In 1st to 5th place ( ) Ms. Wagenknecht stands, then Mrs. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I don't know anyone around me anymore who reads this paper. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the known level where nothing is below that.
And now at the latest, well dialectically, Ms. Wagenknecht should not yet be completely stupid the most popular politician of all, d. hm there we go Be a peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. ( And now no more differentiation is needed.) )

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against the high inflation rate "absolutely" necessary for "absolutely" further interest rate hikes in the fight against the high inflation rate. " Inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can easily rise again and China's opening up can also temporarily boost prices, Sewing told Welt am Sonntag, Sewing told Welt am Sonntag.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank( ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and added a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on the 16th. Looked forward to March. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. Higher lending rates can also lead to postponement of investments and thus weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. “ The consequences of sustained high inflation are far more serious than higher financing costs for some countries,” Sewing said. “ Of course we have to keep an eye on that, but a high level of debt must not stop the ECB from acting consistently.”
The ECB aims for price stability in the euro area in the medium term with an inflation rate of two percent. That target has been a long way off for months now. Although inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro less. Sharp increases in energy prices, which are a key driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption "will collapse sooner or later, " warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks ( BdB) . "I currently see this as the greatest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario” .
Bosch boss Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" in infrastructure projects proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz( SPD) . "There will need to be a political and social dialogue on this, " he said. And he may also be a bit more controversial, " he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes a set of rules will eventually emerge in the end, which will not necessarily need to be as fast as the LNG terminals that went into operation around the turn of the year, but also not as slow as before either.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas ( LNG) was opened. The aim was to close a gap in gas supplies due to a lack of Russian gas supplies. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz( SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany pace" on the occasion. In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it's very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, that should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will, " said Hartung, saying. Therefore, there must still be a process of negotiation as to what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, they tried and failed with the classic set of rules. ‘ We should think again, whether the previous approach was so correct.’ Maybe we overdid it with the set of rules and made it too complicated for ourselves."
In view of the many open tasks, such as the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung, but said Hartung. “ As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as it gets.”
The union warns of breaking up the Bayer group.
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a breakup of the group after an announced change of management at Bayer. "From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three pillars, is perfectly positioned to meet the challenges of the future, " said Francesco Grioli, union board member and Bayer supervisory board, of the "Rheinische Post" ( Saturday edition), the "Rheinische Post" ( Saturday edition) .
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health business with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business. “ The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability  not hedge fund activism.”
The background to this is the change of management at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. Controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The ex-pharmaceutical boss of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been the subject of criticism. The 2018 takeover of the US seed producer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars depends on the manager after the manager says. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes into the house about alleged cancer risks from the weed killer glyphosate. Bayer shares have been plummeting for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It had been known for some time that Baumann would not seek an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024 and, in fact, would not run until 2024. Pressure had been exerted by long-term strategic investors. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also participated. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for the group to be split up.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the value of the company, " said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the Rheinische Post. On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform.
Paris.
On Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are opposing a government project with the concentrated protest on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected across the country on Saturday to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, trade unions are mobilizing against the centre-right government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. Twice already, more than a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750 were honed. 1, 000 participants in protests counted. A turbulent debate has been going on in parliament for a week about the controversial reform.
Already, many people in France work longer than until the age of 62, if they have not yet paid in long enough for a deduction-free pension when they reach the age limit. In many strenuous professions, people could hardly work any longer, say the opponents of reform. In addition, employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not completely wear out their health on the job.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund.
Macron justifies the reform with an imminent deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the height of the pension to be kept stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics question the government's calculations, demanding that the state find other sources of funding to keep the pension system in balance - the pension system.
But it's not just the retirement age that the government wants to work on. The increase in the necessary payment period for a full pension, which was already decided years ago, is to be accelerated. Furthermore, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is expected to rise to around 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was stopped; even then, there were massive protests and strikes. Already several presidents before Macron tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protest and strikes were certainly all of them.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative republicans, who have announced support. However, some of the MEPs - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote, Macron's fear of crippling strikes is likely to be at the moment. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers to keep them calm and not to lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather is expected - lots of sunshine at high altitudes.
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. So, that means a lot of sunshine is to be expected everywhere.
Offenbach Offenbach.
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye, " explains meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. " Although this high will shift a little to the east in the course of the next week. But it continues to determine the weather in Germany"
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel, says. “ Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands dreary high fog gray for days, while there is pure sun in the high altitudes of the low mountains.”
Thus, Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it can also rain a little from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up as the day goes on and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or overcast in high fog. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, then the gradually getting stronger sun nibbles at the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more during the day, " says the meteorologist, saying. At the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia sun is expected all day, elsewhere it will only have to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine around 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, only around 3 degrees are expected in the south-east. In addition, weak winds blow from different directions.
On Tuesday there may again be only tough dissipation of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be clear after the fog has cleared. In high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps, the sun is forecast to shine all day all day. Depending on the sunshine, temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominatorin hadert: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia.
The defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia was very disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can, " said the Italian on ZDF after she had threaded at a gate and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the season's six races in this discipline so far. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline, but Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, will have to wait further. She was absent from her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
“ I was actually thinking I’ d be fine. It was a matter of hundredths of a second, " Goggia said after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel now. “ I’ m disappointed. I gave it all. But that's how life is" but that's the way life is. Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected and ultimately missed by all the experts: " But they aren't" but she said.

Zelensky and ministers oppose Russia's participation in the Olympics.
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Paris Olympics, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee ( IOC) .
They agreed on a joint conference call to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues, " said Minister Jurgita Rozugždinien retakenly.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of Great Britain. British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter that it was a very productive meeting. “ And I have made Britain's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus cannot be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this subject"
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. “ While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions,” Zelensky said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag was ultimately soaked in blood and not wearable because of the Russian war of aggression.
Ukraine threatens to boycott.
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelensky called on officials to work to protect Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee( IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty", which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The conference was prompted by the IOC's announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had also reaffirmed during the consultations that it would refuse the start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's effort to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way, "a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said in a dpa request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser( SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: " Sport should be clear in its condemnation of Putin's brutal war against Ukrainian civilians. Great sporting events do not take place in "air space" Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated from.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they are clearly committed to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition on discrimination.

According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its main battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the Russian army's main stockpile of tanks has been "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine, " said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander machte bei einer Online-Veranstaltung der Denkfabrik Center for a New American Security keine weiteren Angaben zur Zahl der nach US-Einschätzung beschlagnahmten und zerstörten Panzer, die nach US-Einschätzung beschlagnahmt und zerstört wurden.
Ukraine is poised to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has pledged to supply Kiev with Challenger 2 main battle tanks for March. Germany, in a coalition with other states, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, in all likelihood, their delivery will take much longer.
Russia will Nachlegen.
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging abroad for planes, missiles, tanks, " Medvedev, who is now vice-chief of the Russian Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk, during a visit to the country of Omsk. ‘ It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology  including modern tanks.’
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army. This means, for example, that individual sectors can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil over Army postings.
Because the post that the former director of the Museum of Military History ( HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klasius Tanner( ÖVP) defends the action.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is to a previously vacant position, the minister said, because the appointment is being made to a previously vacant position. She does not want to comment on "speculations by a liberal staff representative", which she does not want to comment on. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these are purged from Tanner's point of view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current security policy issues.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the" unusual ordering process" The decision was based on the "appearance of Postenschacher, " says SPÖ military spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is “ still up to its neck in the swamp of corruption”, said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense, said. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Karneval: First fools go to their knees before costs.
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are also difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total cost of the move.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades are cancelled. The "Train of Happy People" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, takes place for the first time after the pandemic. Also at the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht no removals were cancelled.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We're going through our event, " says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But here, too, financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors weren't found or the existing ones contributed even more, reserves would have to be touched - "that doesn't happen every year" - "that doesn't happen every year". The current deficit: about 200 for the time being. 000 euros.
And inflation: In the case of confectionery, there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. By luck, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. For the move, however, it is already certain that it will be more expensive. Security requires twice as much staff as it did in 2020.
If you stand by the side of the road at the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland, you could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have so much in them. Camel or not, the number of visitors is likely to be large: “ I think that if it doesn't rain from pots that day, then we can definitely expect an increased crowd,” says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that for two years there was no regular Rose Monday procession. Of course, the train can't be replaced by anything".
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail. However, the train is "generally" deficitary, that's no secret, that's not a secret.
Ukraine diary: Dreams and home-made vodka.
Ukrainians are not considered hard-drinking for nothing. There is domestic beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner or Warsteiner. I can't tell a big difference in taste. The same is true with vodka, which is widespread. They burn here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here as well how little you can believe the Russians. They say as tourists, you should be careful with it. But it is only when he goes on a mass sale that applies only when he goes on a mass sale. Then there will probably also be a patrol of people.

Biathlon-WM: The Federal President sees the favorite victory and praises Oberhof.
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot" Flocke" at the airport by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger.
Oberhof.. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Championship sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the VIP stand on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range were actually falling. “ I had to get the results on my phone,” Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, pointing to the clouds of fog that kept drifting into the stadium, which severely impaired the viewpoint on the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "I've been fascinated by biathlon since the Olympics in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, " he revealed, also praising Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The refurbished arena is great and offers ideal conditions, offering ideal conditions. That's what the athletes say - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the World Cup was awarded "all right now". In terms of sustainability, too, the site is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe" for the next few years and even decades."
In terms of sport, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again outpaced the competition. Despite a penalty loop after a shooting error, he secured himself in 23: 31 in the morning. 7 minutes - the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of winter - and thus his second world championship title at Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless brother Tar Kranken( 14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid( 1 penalty round/ 39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale( 1/ 43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
One day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph, the local ski hunters could not intervene in the battle for medals. Johannes Kühn finished with a 1:04 deficit after a shooting error and a 1:04 deficit. 8 minutes as the best German, eighth place. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth ( 1:14) . 6) Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedict Doll disappointed again. After its botched mixed deployment on Wednesday, the Black Forest left five discs this time and disappeared as 55 in the form of 55. deeply disappointed and without comment in the cabin.
Bö was 14 years ago. 300 spectators entered the race with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However: On his last two standing shots he had the luck of the brave; they each landed on the edge of the discs and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the victory together with his five-year older brother: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him, " said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes"
There is little doubt that Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's persecution, too. For women, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann- Wick. ‘ If you start with number one, the goal is not to come in tenth, but not to come in tenth. There's only full throttle and attack to defend the No. 1, sporting director Felix Bitterling took his “ locomotive” to task. The organizers expect for the double event( 13) . 25 and 15 respectively. 30m. / ZDF and Eurosport live) an almost sold-out arena.
Brych dislikes" swarm of bees" on the pitch.
Felix Brych referee Felix Brych decides on referee ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches. Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Germany's top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in cooperation on the field on the pitch. "I do think that there are new behaviors of the players who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area, " said the 47-year-old of the German Press Agency. “ We discussed that during the winter break. We have decided we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it."
Most recently, two coaches had also been considered with referrals. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup loss to FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "The trainer's behavior also falls into the realm of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has also increased in this area, that the behaviour towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive, in the case of referees. We also want to punish such unsportsmanlike conduct consistently,” Brych said.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out that coaches and referees work together in a fundamentally good way. "Overall, the ratio fits well. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. This will then require the person concerned to live. That should not be anything earth-moving, " said Fröhlich to the German Press Agency.
" Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if emotionality spills over into personal denigration, then you have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referees,” said Fröhlich. In recent cases, those involved would have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be important if a general rethinking process were to get underway that such behavior is simply not appropriate, " said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible implications at another level. "Of course, events from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviours,” said Fröhlich. “ Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful.”
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach.
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro in front of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.

Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile strikes. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile strikes is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants were damaged, the head of the Ukrenerho power plant, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The situation in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad for electricity supplies. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor unit had to be shut down at the Khmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant, and production at the Riwne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants was curtailed.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. However, in a video message, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bachmut.
It will be on the 24th. February will have been at war for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger of Russian missile strikes continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, an air alert was triggered late Friday evening for the fifth time for the day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones, " said the military administration of the Kiev region. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down across Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for grid company.
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, during the election campaign to spin them off failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, the compromise of an infrastructure company had been agreed, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. That is, it does not need to generate and transfer profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros.
The two consulting firms are intended to help the federal government accompany this process. The refurbishment backlog in the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very late in time. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this grievance with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to more recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023- Gold for Denise Herrmann- Wick: " Please can someone pinch me? “
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann- Wick at all. She would have slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", the pulse had not come down as soon as the run-in. "Such a race, " and that at home world championships, " you can't describe it in words, " she said. 11 3000 spectators cheered to booming pop music with German flags, caregivers and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoying biathlon", that's what she had planned.
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old was the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the seasons in the World Cup. Herrmann- Wick is the only German to win two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she is currently in fifth place. And even though the power density is significantly higher among women at the top than among men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, you had rather others on the list for this sprint victory as a result of that sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison.
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing leader. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018, with high levels of tensions since 2018.

Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiracy with the US government to overthrow him, along with the US government.
Bundeswehr: The armament industry is calling for more orders from special funds to come in.
The first armaments projects have therefore already been canceled, and further projects are threatened with the same thing, as the" Welt am Sonntag" reports. Which investments would be omitted in concrete terms, however, could not yet be said at present. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time, " reads a response from the federal government to a question from Member of the Bundestag Ingo Gädechens ( CDU) .
The reason for the falling investment sum is rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which was approved by the Bundestag in June 2022, must bear the interest burden on the loans itself. If these increase, less money is available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum decreases.

Stuttgart Palace Square commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster.
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria occupies the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people remembered the victims at Stuttgart's Schlossplatz and prayed for them.
Many parishioners followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach, young and old, women and men. They all listened earnestly and silently to the prayer of the Imam. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this disaster as well.

The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish Islamic Union( Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind over a period of several days in Glockenstraße, which are to be trucked to the earthquake areas by truck. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat inlay Ebersberg - Ebersberg.
‘ After eating, you shall rest, or take a thousand steps.’    The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it in practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because those who are not sitting in the middle of a rocky desert thanks to the home office, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now use the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or just as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least you could get that impression around Lake Egglburg, where between 12 and 2 p.m. not only dog owners cavort about themselves for a long time between 12 and 14 p.m.
One reason, of course, could also be that modern people can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things in the course of an optimal time slot use. Because why not on the occasion of a short march through nature, news from the settlement is heard by the neighbor who has not been seen for a long time. Or meet your girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema. Work and private life could also be combined in this way - who says that the appointment with the tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors. As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course, they are not close by.
What can also be done excellently is the acquisition of natural resources. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands on a table by the side of the road next to a cheese on the side of the road table. Or potatoes and meat. It's only stupid if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and taken appropriate precautions. Thus, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer with empty hands and regret in their voices. “ Sorry, we unfortunately forgot the money” .
The disappointment can be felt, as you have a companion with a wallet yourself, but not a transport container. What makes the sympathetic chance acquaintance known. To which the man replies: "But that is not true, but that is not true. You are very likely to have a bag with you. "In this case, he points to the hood of the jacket, which was quickly thrown over before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always puts everything in there, always pulling everything in her hand. “
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat inlay and on this midday short trip you have not only been enriched by a saddle of lamb, but also by a decidedly practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due that day - after dinner - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured.
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and, for reasons as yet unexplained, left the road in a left-hand curve, according to the police report, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a guide post, crashed sideways into a tree and stopped a few meters away. The collision trapped the driver in his car in the middle of the collision. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The emergency services took the seriously injured to a hospital. Because there was a suspicion of incapacity for driving, a blood sample was ordered. According to a police report, total damage in the amount of 1000 euros was incurred at Audi.
Donald Trumps Steuerunterlagen: Point for the rule of law.
The U.S. Department of Justice has ruled: The tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump in 2018, then still in office as president of the United States.
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the ministry's decision on Friday said.
Contrary to U.S. political custom, real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He defended himself all the way to the Supreme Court against a release. A prosecutor's office in New York has since received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There, the circle of authorized users is somewhat larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the Committee's investigation. In addition, confidential elements also repeatedly penetrate from parliament to the outside world.
The leader of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law" as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a national security issue, she wrote on Twitter. ‘ The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as president,’ Pelosi said, explaining to Pelosi.

Cabaret stories from the Big Apple.
Vince Ebert has a mission: The studied physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, by his own admission, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programmes. This is the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" that fits. Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic skepticism about science remains to be seen here. In any case, his humor suits Vienna very well.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York for a year in 2019 as a stand-up comedian. Now, however, he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can and, above all, what it cannot do. Corona, of course, also occurs, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question many postpone: What is really important is what is really important. It's all with a huge wink, unagitated and very ironically. And so they are not only well entertained, but can also learn something new.

1 General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/ Y monitor as well. This game illustrates the combat action from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level, there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is depicted by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which become increasingly difficult to hit as the game progresses. In addition, UFOs still appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five( 5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction process, the game initiation process, the game AB, the initial input to the highest scores, and the self-test process. The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4 isn’ t that amazing! Gameplay.
The game sequence is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is finished. The game starts with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by observing the displayed text in the upper left corner of the cockpit by displaying it in the upper left corner of the cockpit. An indication can, for example, be. B HEERE'Z A QWESHCHUN FER YA. In addition, on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, a dot is visible that represents the enemy's position.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is well targeted on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMY IN THE FIRE area is simultaneously displayed in the upper left hint display.
At times, UFO's will appear on screen flying over the battlefield. These are safe missiles that observe combat and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are designed to round out the combat and distract players, as they would usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. A shot by the player brings that 5 to him. 3000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are reached: 1 for a slow-moving tank: 3000 points, for a rocket 2 3000 points and 3 for a super tank. 3000 points. A super tank drives and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several options give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks. In addition, a bonus tank is released after reaching predetermined scores and the appearance of the rocket is varied for a further more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector for this setting option are shown in the figure.
5 Initial entry for maximum results.
If a player exceeds the minimum number of points in the table of maximum scores, HE or SHE can enter three( 3) personal initials in the table after the end of the game. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector PCB or interrupting the mains voltage will erase the table with the highest results. As you delete( RESET), the ten( 10) highest scores are obtained with their initials and re-enrolled on the screen to challenge more players. Every score in excess of 100 are scored. 1, 000 is lying, additionally marked with a tank icon, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically write strokes. After that, the device switches back to the attraction gameplay. ROIGHT, SO, I'Z FIXED ME 'EADACHES.
1 New parts.
The BATTLEZONE device has five( 5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI switchblade. It was strengthened by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering belt, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly puts the control lever in the middle position. The microswitches ter are now fixed with self-locking nuts for easier replacement, for the sake of easy replacement. B Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuit has been extended to two ( 2) interconnected boards, including two ( 2) interconnected boards. These are the analog vector generator boards and auxiliary boards. With the help of clef-switch technology k, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in an even and calm picture. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly engineered power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by expanding the circuit, depending on how the circuit is expanded. D The device house. Due to the new design, it was now possible to set up a new cash register with greater coinage capability. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, intended as a podium for smaller players, thus making it easier to play. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1 as shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2 Equipment inspection.
After removing the package, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should do some verification to finalize the quality controls, only to do so. In order to ensure that the device has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: A NOTICE: Do not yet connect the device to the 220 V network yet. A: Inspect the outside of the housing for damage. B Open the device's maintenance flap and check the components within the device as follows: ( 1) Check all wiring harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Eventuals were open or open, respectively. loose plugs linked to each other.
NOTE: Never forcibly make plug connections. The plugs are provided with a forced guide, so that a correct connection is established. A connector twisted 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
( 2) Check plug connections to the game PC board for correct and fixed-seat seats. ( 3) Note the manufacturing number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check that the punched-in production number matches that of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC Board, Auxiliary PC Board, Controller/Audio II PC Board and TV Monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the backboard side of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your dealer for more service information. ( 4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for proper assembly when assembly is not proper. ( 5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, it can be checked whether the radar screen is also in the bright, orange circled opening of the disguise. If the opening is not precisely centered, the lining, which is attached to the case with tape, must be loosened and re-oriented, and the lining must be re-oriented. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug is on the power supply 1( s) . bc of that i almost cried🙏 im so happy bro. 3) matching the local mains voltage. Checking the cable color on the plug and checking the connection values as listed below:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT.
The desire to develop video games has been sparked in me by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a whole host of new possibilities, and it seemed to me to be a new means of expression with which to push the world to its limits. She represented a way for me to develop new horizons. ‘ I came to be like a caterpillar at the beginning of the 20th, I was like a caterpillar.’ Centuries ago: On the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technique, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything was still to be discovered - in particular a new language that had to be both narrative and visual - to be both. To be honest, I wasn’ t able to satisfy my hunger for the next ten years, to be honest. I had a vague sense that video games exploited a tiny fraction of their amazing creative power because they were too focused on "action" to forget a fundamental element of the human experience world: the sensations of the human experience world. Meanwhile, the technology continued to progress rapidly. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that conveys feelings. Although this could have taken place in a completely different form, of course, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here, and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can certainly create an interactive gaming experience based not only on fighting despicable monsters in dark corridors, but also on boxing for ammunition, but on far more demanding and profound content. It is evidence that both a story and a game content can be offered without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements because of it, without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements. I hope both fancy gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are more skeptical about video games, then I can hope that driving can help change your mindset of this. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspiration, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy, and offers a chance to discover everything first and only. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a great deal of our lives, representing an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we repeatedly saw ourselves as having been forced to question many of the principles previously deemed indestructible. I would be happy if driving  similar to books, movies and songs that have made a lasting impression on you  also isn't going to go smoothly on you, too. David Cage..
THE README FILE
A ReadMe file is included on the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM for viewing the license agreement and updated information about the game. We recommend checking this file so that you can take note of any changes that have been made since this manual has been printed. To view the file, double-click it in the Fahrenheit directory on your hard drive ( usually C:\Programms\Atari\ Fahrenheit) However, you can also access the ReadMe file by first clicking on the Start button on the Windows® taskbar and then selecting “ programs”, “ Atari”, “ Fahrenheit” and finally the ReadMe file.
SETUP AND INSTALLATION.
1 Start Windows® 2000/XP. 2 Put the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM into the DVD-ROM drive. 3 If the “ AutoPlay” option is enabled, the title screen should appear. If "AutoPlay" is not activated, or the installation does not start automatically, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar, and then click Run. Type D:\ Setup, and then click OK. Note: If your DVD-ROM drive is assigned to a letter other than "D", use it accordingly. 4 isn’ t that amazing!

SERVICE PROGRAM
Generally. For programming and testing, the 4 switches in the device, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display is used to select the language ( English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The "Sub-Test" switch can be used to set the languages. When the desired language appears green, press the" Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Deployment programming. This indicator can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, this can be used to discontinue a" maximum amount of credits" that may be before the start of the game" before the start of the game. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch ( appears green), the desired value to this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "sub-test" switch several times, the factory or factory can be used separately. Basic setting is achieved when the bottom line ( RESET lines) lights up green, "Up" button is pressed. Values are reset, the pointer( called the green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000] is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display until "high hit rate so far" This value determines the required number of points/focus scores a player needs so that his own initials ( names) and the hit points can be entered onto the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. When the border is crossed, - if a coin block is in place - the coin acceptance is closed - if a coin lock is in place - the coin acceptance is closed. This can set a limited number of games for a player to play. This value is 1-69 for each other. It should not be so tightly tuned to 99, so by throwing a coin in it, the loans cannot become zero if over 99 is added. An example mode can be selected by setting "maximum loan" on O. Other programming: “ number of games” : Number of markers per credit.
" Threshold": Level of the % number that must be reached in order to switch to the next passage.
" Time limit": Release for additional Sparx.
"Difficulty": Game Sequence Difficulty.
"Pull-on tone": at "0" no sound during standby mode during standby mode.
at" 1" sound also at stand mode( animated sound) " table model": at "0" stand model at" 0".
at" 1" tabletop unit.
The loans per coin are discontinued on the" insert slot programming" ad. High-score program display ( highest hit rate so far") . The scoring points and initials of the player appear, including the next 10 scores, as well as the next 10 scores. Values are used to set to high score selected on the previous display ( set from "Back"), which was selected on the previous display. Press the "Up" switch to discontinue the initials QIX Standard by pressing the "Up" switch. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The" Overall Evaluation" By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. If 1 had to do so. lmao its just me nvm 000 is achieved, the count starts over again. The total number can only appear at 0 when the battery or connector W1 is removed, when the device is switched off, if the battery or connector is removed. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Medium Coins: ( not available) right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Paid credits: Number of credits given for purchased ( revalued coins) . Secured credits: Number of credits given by the device. % Free Spiele: Granted credits( paid+ Granted credits per 100) Played minutes: Number of minutes played. Won minutes: Number of minutes, in extended or won game. % Leisure: Won minutes/played minutes per 100. Average playing time in sec. : minutes played / paid + provided loans.
High Score ( Trefferquote) : Number of times a player had hit rates high enough to oust other players from the high score list. By pressing the" Up" switch, the values are set to 0". By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Insertion slot programming/ normal money setting. Using this display, a standard coin setting can be selected by the operator, or another setting can be programmed.
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. Size values change as the digit changes. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the" Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting that does not correspond to the standard setting is desired, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower scores are unchanged the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that captures his desired scores and changing only the scores which are not appropriate. As soon as the setting has been made, any newly set size can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. When pressed unintentionally, the default setting will appear when pressed. The "Up" and "Down" switches can increase or decrease the values. By pressing the" Test" switch, the process is finished. The coin multiplier (“ coin unit”) says how many coin units are given for every coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin units “ credit” shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the units required before a bonus loan is issued. “ Min, thank you” he said. A " coin" is a value that accumulates loans until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value will not find use of "0" 0". CMOS MEMORY ( memory) AUSFALL.
If "Memory Failure- Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This condition probably shows failure or failure of the battery.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS.
Beginning of the test method. Press the" Sub- Test" switch or the" Self Test" button( SW 1 near the LED display) . All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the" Test" switch the next program is displayed each time. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test begins in auto-test mode. For this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off until it is turned off. If the "Open Coin Door to Test" ad appears, the program plug J 19, 1-2 must be inserted, 1-2 must be inserted. When the J19 plug is removed, the memory ( memory) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off/ I = a / X = test results.
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device will stop and the value of the ROM with the wrong checking sum will appear on the LED's. If the check sum ROM is error-proof, U 10 is displayed first U 10 is displayed. If this test does not succeed, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks ( series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder plug ( 26- 00002- 016 for 2716 or 26- 00002- 032 for 2732) . Communications RAM from the Video Board.
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM, then checking whether the memory was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the box with the o is now in place. a Holding a display, an error was discovered. If the communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by defective wiring ( RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: Fault in the U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM.
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test was passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED- Value: 00 0011 If the device with the o is, if it is the unit. a If the display is held, there is an error in front of it. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or circuits, respectively. decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers will be checked for correctness when reading back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, an error is present. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video-Board ( Anzeige RAM) The display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these descriptions are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy will halt the program, and the LEDs will show the faulty RAM on to it. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not show a RAM failure( 00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next test will be started( Data Hardware) . The data processor must be connected, and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed.
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics on it. So that's also the reason for star #1. The 2nd for getting the right jacket without any apparent seam defects arriving at it. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. Had oriented myself from the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she's supposed to be this tight, and I didn't want to fight her way into an S or M with my nails.    In the end, it would have fit from the length and at the hip, both.   the rest of it soo i could swim in it. In addition, the food material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere. It’ s just a shame.  It will be sent back: /
Fast delivery and good workmanship.
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well on both sides. We ordered her for our daughter, she is totally thrilled, she is totally thrilled. She wears the 158 otherwise and she fits the 36 quite well in this case and will certainly be worn next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality.
I opted for the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on my remote, and that's not optimal after that. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the edition doesn't quite fit. But what I am wrong is this Then I slightly changed it so that it would fit. The overlay looks very robust and you can no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the whole area. worked without any problems. There's nothing like this which will slide anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Too big for less than 1 year, unfortunately.
The product itself is okay for me, but not for a year. Since the area to chew is far too large for the small mouth after all, it is much too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use him because of his size. We take him back by 12 months now and he can use it again. Has also not yet been able to bite anything with his already few existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient/ Unfortunately goes back.
I have probably been blinded here by the partly exaggerated reviews. so basically for A's i notice im already using 2 of my irl buds ( back & forth sometimes) . A very large one ( to keep the equipment) and a pretty small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. So that's when I get the Sigma 70-2002 right now. I bought 8, the little Lowepro has finally gotten too small, and I need a replacement. On Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price ( just under 29 euros) and I was actually very happy about this purchase, but I had read through many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the sobering followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, that can not be said. But he ( as many reviews have written) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices    Man, this is just not true, people. I was really hoping that was the case, but there really can be no mention of that, but I don't know. The padded walls are much thinner and don’ t give the same protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more labby. Overall, the feel of this backpack can't be compared to that of my Lowepro. Also, the travel closures and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly of high quality. So I opted for the backpack to go back in. If I buy equipment of many thousands of euros, then I unfortunately also have to take the money into my hands for a reasonable backpack, then I also have to take the money for a reasonable backpack. Quality apparently has its price here. As somebody that doesn’ t want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me, And it's not like I found the decision difficult. When I was packing up the backpack, after 2 minutes I knew it was going back. What I really liked is the color inside. Here you will definitely find his things much faster than with a grey interior life. The backpack is definitely a great thing to do with someone who has different demands on a backpack, but for me I’ m going back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part.
So far, I’ ve had the electrical series of E. L. Todd liked it best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and had been really looking forward to the third part? The part is about Volt and Taylor's feelings all the time, and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admitting everything and is then like a small child in every argument and ripping off.  At the same time there were also discrepancies in my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt tried and didn't believe Taylor's ex and when he said Taylor was going for him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and that he heard it himself. But by the start of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is struggling with Taylor, saying Taylor. T got her hopes up, then its the last part of the series, and I think that this part is the weakest, and also quite unnecessary, but we do see the need. I will still read the fourth part and hope that will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. It would bring more tension back to history.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn to do so. First off, the movie's not as bad as many write now. Of course, of course, the story is totally constructed, and always designed according to the same scheme F, again and again. If you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like when you see the beginning. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and does not appreciate anything, and does not learn to do so. And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us. How many times have I just thought about this movie ( and that even though I know it’ s just a film, and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, there are often tears in your eyes ( often the tears in your eyes) . That's why the Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom has already been really neatly made. It's just a shame that people just don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film, it's still a bit of a reach. We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves in this regard. Out of greed and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance Empathy for the environment and living beings: misrepresentation. 4 stars because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema still.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't even want to be a Hollywood blockbuster. This film is above all "French" - it's also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic.
Taste like quench from the 90's, because of orange, but it doesn't matter either that. 5 days every morning a package: nothing moved, but nothing at all. I am 12 cm in my belly circumference. Flatulence like never before After that, diarrhea 5- 8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea remains for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size, only 2 stars were given( unfortunately only seen too late), with the larger full 5 This is very, very weird, this one.
terrible stench and low outcome. I dyed my blond hair a chocolate brown in October with an intense tint, and in February/March I used this hair color remover in February/March. I have used the product twice now. The first time I noticed directly that it smelled terrible. However, there was still a not too bad result, a chestnut brown ( somewhat darker) came out. Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions even if the result was not satisfied, another time. This time it was a waste of time. It didn’ t make a difference, my hair looked like it did the first time I tried it. Worst of all, it still stinked weeks after use.  No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn’ t go away.
Highly recommended.
I’ ve been taking the tablets for a long time now, and I always take one every 5 days. My vitamin balance had been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and even a prolonged additional illness. That's why I wanted to help my immune system not only through a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 a little on the jump. It also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable living. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also consider how long you can take the tablets. Highly recommended.
not working properly   After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following gross deficiencies which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems "connecting" to the phone over time: This means no longer charging even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and putting it back in solves the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new shortage. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinserting of the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times now. This is not a big deal my issue is, but I think that the battery enclosure should be perfect right now and I am very disappointed with the product for the 30€ worth, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months now.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing.
I don’ t know how all this good stuff comes up against me. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you get from every optician in a slightly smaller form gift. Cleanup effect is as good as a kitchen towel, and no better. I have promised myself a lot more of these scarves, it is also really very thin, it is also very thin. Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it. I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these towels is far exaggerated. You shouldn't give more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response.
I bought this speaker for a shower when, unfortunately, my smaller free speaker which I received as a giveaway broke which is not good enough. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof ( I got shcon in the shower), reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great, Bluetooth works great.   Of course, you have to water the suction, otherwise it will dissolve.  he can play sound very loudly   yes its not even just me nvm  What I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is played as bass and not made to a higher frequency, instead of being converted into a higher frequency. However, that causes one problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals hurt almost in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough to be heard. My old speaker didn't play bass well as a bass, but the frequencies were presented fairly naturally at volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with Onforu, which I think is a bit annoying. So I have to deduct one star from that and so on. I have now expected more from the frequency response.
very bad very much
The paint had chipped off in a few places and if you just went over it with your hand, the paint went off in some places as well. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore but unfortunately only at our expense but they would only replace the damaged parts as if both commode were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and transferred the money back to us. A LOB on Amazon.
Better to spend a little more money on them.
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in quality. Individual parts are provided which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I have not processed it because I desperately needed this product to work with. The supplied adhesive hardly holds, but sticks properly for it - like chewing gum, which, however, does not become hard. Already one day after gluing almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out ( at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to stick everything together. The templates are partially incompletely punched out, partly incomplete. Okay for a one-off, and as a joke for a party, but for a wedding, I’ d invest a little more money and get into a high-end product when I got into a wedding.
I’ m not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic clasps + beautiful look + stable when set up + shelf can be positioned any way you want.
- Doors slam through magnets ( maybe you can compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean places.
- supplied dowels are much too small and wobble ( had no others and have them since no cup was in the house, glued with craft glue) - the holders for the shelf wobble a bit ( I wrapped it with some paper and balanced it) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give less stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Also, I think that it is a bit too expensive for this purpose as well.
I like the coffee.    but
there are only 3 stars 4 The taste is subjectively good, but I think the original capsules are better ( but also much more expensive) . In that respect, I would have given 5* due. Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't flow evenly ( if at all) . ) Also the additional plastic waste ( individually packaged s. Photo) will mean for me a star deduction from the photo. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full marks soon.
I'm getting on my nerves.
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: natural sounds sound terrible, and super loud at that. I couldn't turn them down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed and get off the bed immediately. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up with my face in my face, because I thought it was already tomorrow, because I thought it would be tomorrow. However, when it comes back and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and also the color change, unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light. I also liked the battery it was designed to have, so if you don’ t have to, you don’ t have to re-enter the clock and chill once you get out, it’ s not overpowered. However, I went back for the reasons mentioned above.
Light super, workmanship insufficient.
I have replaced four lights in the house with these lights. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a version  instead, a circuit board is laughing at me at this point.   There was nothing in the box either. "6 payment 4 get" is not a good deal. I'm sure Amazon would have settled this quickly and accommodatingly, but I didn't find out until after the return period. So that's why I see this as my fault and live with it. Yet it's not a good indication of the quality of these lights - the only reason two-star deduction has so far been for the only reason for two-star deduction. The light itself is super light The rooms are now very brightly illuminated and evenly illuminated. The light color tends to go in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, study, laundry room, etc. For living spaces, I personally would go out with warmer lighting. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt pear. However, other lamps can do the same and I may also get intact copies there according to the order. If my grade is helpful, I would be happy to have a positive score. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great.
I’ ve gotten gestures and I’ d like to share my first look, then, I’ d like to share it. On a positive note, this would be useful. I've been thinking for a long time whether or not I will order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. ** The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang them** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on panels with coating. ** They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. ** They also do not pass the heat and can therefore be touched directly and thus can be touched directly. ** However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swipe, they'll be gone. Finally, I have to say I am very surprised and I can only recommend it.
B-goods sold as new goods.
Amazon Prime shipping is just top notch. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet, unpacked and all the parts checked, all of the parts checked. In doing so, we found that the part had already been installed before. We had to find considerable scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The hose fittings/connections were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink( unfortunately) . Only now did we see that scratch marks/streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably already been delivered and sent back. We keep this faucet in there and put it in the sink in the basement because that doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; Never again do we order such goods via Amazon, but rather spend a little more on the hardware store where we get orderly goods. I just think it’ s sad for customers to be fooled like that...
Product itself top, outdoor sensor unfortunately broken after only 6 months after only.
Basically, I am quite satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, with no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple, and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame like a small picture frame. the only thing that is annoying is after anyway which Is why the hell happened. For a six-year period of use, the device, which measures the values on the outside, seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be still intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of outdoor humidity are always displayed. This is a huge BUST, as the device has been placed in a shielded place on the outside, and also the reason why I give this product only two stars for this product.
Strong mower with a weak grass collector.
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery as of today is still happily driving through the Republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon’ s service was outstanding with the triggering of a replacement delivery as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression on me, making a good impression. The engine is strong and there is a nice clipper. The volume isn't exactly impressive, but ok, but it's okay I guess. Unfortunately, the big drawback is the catcher. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and in between fabric. If you just drop it off completely, then of course it will be compressed, and parts of the content will fall out of it. Worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator shows red even when the catch basket is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Always emptying the basket on a large lawn when it is only half full cannot be the solution now. So I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring.
I have two of these devices which are both. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The supplied plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built in a solid structure. Space temperature and humidity are displayed, but only once to three times a day ( adjustable) are displayed in the app to save battery power ( adjustable) . I am giving only 4 stars for the following reason: - The soft rear wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with fairly thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device itself does not reconnect, even if you place it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and re-position them after a short break, then it connects again. It should actually work without removing the battery and not with the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY.
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not been able to level the Hotbed properly until today. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there and the front right screw falls out, since it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low, although the hotbed is still too low. The bars that hold the car are straight, as well as the table also. Maybe someone knows what you can do, because that's how it's impossible to print anything. For construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you would have to lay them again several times, which is very exhausting, which is very exhausting. I have also already written to support but still haven't received a response after a week of waiting. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back. expected a little more.
robust and precise am positively surprised.
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be made. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can start right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it a full score for it and I think it will last at least as long as the old caliper goes. There is a clear purchase recommendation from mit and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, permanent smell.
Bought the bracelet and have not worn it for the time being because it emits a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell is not gone, although it has been constantly "aired", although it has been constantly "aired". Once it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. Rate from purchase.
Ok for the price
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks pretty massive. The larger balls are free to move, which in turn I think is quite nice. However, the chain is very simple overall, so I've already torn open the clasp twice now. So far I’ ve been able to repair him again and again, but I don’ t think that’ s going to last long. But for the low price, you simply can't expect anything really high quality either.
Very nice piece of jewelry.
A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually holds true. You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't open, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather conditioner, which makes it a little softer and more cuddly. Only: who has something magnetic on the arm: The clasp is made of steel.
Unfortunately, scrap metal. I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that these were used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after some gimmick.    if you stick to the instructions it doesn't work at all only after I removed a battery from the base station again and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about it didn't last long, because after only an hour the connection was gone again, even though the stations were next to the base station, although the stations were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three stations was very different. All in all, not to be used for me like that. The thing went all over the place :-( In any case, should advise against buying, will only bring trouble.
Transport damage.
Hello, I've had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off after 3.5 years. I bought it again for one reason only, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections for the gas pump as well as the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will do its job a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I was in desperate need of the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing didn't affect the pumping performance anymore.
You could have thought better. I often have to deal with a lot of different keys, so I thought that such an organizer would be more enjoyable than walking around all the time with a huge bunch of keys. At first everything went quite well too! However, the paint went off quite quickly and always the screws had to be tightened. It's nice that you can do that with a penny coin, but also only with a penny coin. I have not found a suitable slotted screwdriver which would not have ruined the whole screw immediately. Now to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: the attachment of the keys. It is nice that you can use the different parts, the screw at different sizes or sizes, respectively. Lengths can be set, but if you have screwed the whole thing together for the first time, you need pliers to disassemble the whole thing. Making the key in itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill, all about being a game of patience and balance. Finally, the third time I installed it, the screw in the thread broke, making the whole thing unusable. Conclusion: If at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the given dimensions.
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all that featherweight. Since I have no comparison ( my first organizer set), I will not be able to actually evaluate the goods until after the first use. In advance, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can't really think about it so much like there literally full up B packed for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before or so - as before. It should still be noted that not 8 but 10 parts were delivered as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/bags still inside. Not high-quality workmanship, I wanted to mention that anyway, I wanted to mention that. The fact that the cosmetic bag is a different color and is made of different material than the other bags doesn't really bother me personally cuz I personally feel like I'm not in the way of a cosmetic bag. Price-performance ratio I see as a trial price and it is fine.
So Fucking kill me.
So, ordered before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas also. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it wouldn't do it anymore. Battery. Exchanged But it still doesn’ t work. So, I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can, too.
Care is always good. The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound in my very high quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life is very long enough. Definitely fully adequate sound. I liked that the headset doesn't hurt even after wearing it for a long time, and so it's very comfortable being done by a lot of people. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommendation for purchase in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions.  The price-performance ratio is fully consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the flash offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller ( been recommended) . I just wished the neckline wasn't so deep and also the sleeves could use a little more fabric ( if you don't have a very narrow upper arm like the model in the picture) But all in all a chic dress for many opportunities.
Get your fingers off me. It doesn't get worse than that. I genuinely and seriously did not expect such a junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVDs usually go, Blu-rays are recognized as unreliably as much as possible, and Blu-rays are recognized as unreliably. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes Rödel sounds like the way people haven't heard them since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes, you can either restart the computer because nothing will work or the disc will finally be recognized. But then you can't press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language or anything during the movie or anything at all. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze that cannot be fixed. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. Additionally, if you purchase PowerDVD or the like for a fee, the price of this drive will double.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I really needed a second port and if I had just bought a decent extension I probably wouldn't have bought this shapeless lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably, And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick also does not simply dangle around in the area, as with a completely normal extension cord. So not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is narrow :-)
Small but sad. I purchased this product so that I could have an audio output on the iPad ( Pro) as well as a display to connect to it. With IOS 12, you can now also move data back and forth, too. so thats kinda neat imo Furthermore, the audio edition was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I had already had to send back could not send this back. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller on the tablet via BT and that of the HDMI on the TV. Being prepared at the same time is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. For what do I still use my PlayStation: P There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. So that doesn't fit the adapter with my case. Naja also holds so secure and has contact from there and from there on.   All in all, although a bit expensive, justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and made stable in one piece of aluminum. Price performance fits.
Lots of power.
Top device. Has been running for months with no problems. Is not exactly light or quiet, but brings decent performance. I think the middle position of the temperature ( emu setting) is a bit too cool, so I am always on leg 2 ( 2 level), so it will be on the waitlist. Has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived well. And I like the simple design too that. Competitive products like to look like spaceships.
Very good.
The workmanship of the brush head made a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can recommend them without reservation.
Great product with weak battery life.
We've had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode the location is accurate to what feels like 0.5m in live mode. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, it likes to jump a few meters at a time, which is not disturbing but is not annoying. I would buy it again anytime I wanted to. However, what would be great would be a battery which lasts longer. He currently lasts about 1.5 hours a day. Here's a great solution which would last 7-14 days. There is an XL version but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not have to last with us at all and we also find it impractical to change it every day. You shouldn't deal with the dog with his collar :-) The app also worked perfectly for the product.
Garbage after a few weeks garbage.
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They match well and seem to be comfortable too. However, life expectancy is increasingly decreasing. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education class, the sole breaks after only a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. So with the last couple, it was also in normal use that they didn't last long, but I was thinking for class it would be enough. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original, it fits perfectly. My last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these here are poorly processed at first glance at first glance. Comfortable though, they are just like the one I used to have before. There doesn't seem to be a difference at first glance either, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly made and the strap is quite loose on the heel, and it's very likely that they won't last five years like my previous one. I'm curious to see it go.
Surprisingly good.
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and I would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it with good luck. For delivery, the mattress and a car air pump were included. About the mattress: I put them in the car( Citroen Berthold) by testing them. Just kind of realized that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it off and hopefully it won’ t reappear. In the inflated state, a lying test was carried out directly in the inflated state. It's easy to lie on and fits great with the festival, which is great. Of course, this mattress can’ t replace your own bed, but the one for days at the event is the pure luxury it is. The mattress comes in great with my car in it. Before that, we took out the seats in the back. So it fits perfectly at the moment. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged in the car's cigarette lights. However, the plug was defective( something at the solder point) . Since my friend is skilled at it, he was able to repair it, and reassembled, the good part worked great and pumped up the mattress in zero comma Nix. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm then curious for the hardness test at the festival. I hope she doesn’ t lose air and lasts a long time. Just like he's not reappearing Schimmel again After the test I can definitely recommend it once. So, if I have any other experience, I will update the review accordingly ( if possible) .
Definitely not worth more than 10€   ‘ Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me.’ :( 1 For fast shipping. 2 Because of the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar has been torn open by the läppling processing directly on day 1 over several doors on days 1, unfortunately. It will be on 21st. There were no more doors to the door and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the rest of the parts accordingly, since they had already fallen towards him, quasi already fallen towards him. The parts often come out of a mess, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to attach the parts. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. ( Most of the time, the windshield will come with it.) This is also very difficult to bring back. ) In itself, I wouldn't buy this calendar anymore, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either, Eventually, the manufacturers are rethinking the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and making it better to do so, making it better for the next issue. :\
a real drone
I’ m so excited about the drone. My 7 year-old daughter flies with it. Inside, it flies very well and 5 minutes for flying very well. Flight time is usually sufficient at all. That hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly I didn't expect otherwise at the price, but falls from the ceiling onto the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, please contact us.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. I didn't see when I bought it that it wasn't a game CD, just a code to download the game. That would be fine so far, but you're forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, the computer has been constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails because of the battery life.
I had been really looking forward to the clock. Design and optics great, news etc were displayed without any problems. Service worked well.    and yet I'll send them back in. Drr big hook: the battery and its runtime Charged in the evening, placed only on drm cabinet overnight and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. I received a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already at the end of the day/early afternoon and then you can't even read the time again. Therefore, for not being usable of me. Sorry.
Noble case with limitations.
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, you should definitely get a case for yourself. I recently liked cases in which you can also insert your credit card. So that's what the shell is talking about here. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it will be too much, then the lid will be a bit high. One is enough for me to have. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well-made. She looks noble. In contrast to many other cases, the phone is embedded all around, only savings from the connections are made. Otherwise, you can operate on-off switches and volume controls on the sides well through the case. Disadvantage is that on some QI chargers, it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. Even with the leather-lined QI station of TORRO, it doesn't work even for TORRO. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged if the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well-made
high quality case with bulletproof glass film
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11 11. Fits very well and is easy to put on, too. The material is comfortable to hold on and does not cause dirt. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good value for money. This case gives the phone some grip. It's not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone, not too tightly. Overall a good buy.
