Diego Cocca becomes new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. Until a few days ago, the 50-year-old was not among the favorites for the post. He had only taken over as coach of Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach sparked anger at the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds in the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blossoms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blossoms up" is the name of a campaign by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the help of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been put into the ground since 2015. The aim: to create flowering islands over a wide area in the Geesthacht municipal area, where insects can find food at any time. "When the weather is favorable, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe of Geesthachter Nabu. He has beehives on the property himself.
In order to ensure that the project is not just an initiative of conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also has a wide impact on private gardens, explanatory signs are repeatedly placed next to the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. Passers-by should be able to inform themselves in this way about what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will specifically replant at home.
In the first week of January was already the start of the season at the wild hazel
More recent are shrubs such as winter-scented hedge cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the tubs on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, are leafless and are just showing their first delicate blossoms in white and pink, and have recently been given more signs. "The winter-scented hedge cherry is a very broad bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," it says among other information, for example, about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bedding plants that are now showing flowers, however. The first week of January saw the start of the wild hazel season. It blooms particularly luxuriantly at the Richtweg at the incline, in the Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young".
Munich - Dancing god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them when he looks down from the sky to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m. sharp for a lively tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) from the "Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap is my life, I can't imagine life without it".
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing their dancing legs with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today we would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "With dancing, acting and singing I spent my life".
At 79 years of age, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the circle of tap dancers. She says: "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the wooden soles used at first, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dance. Here the tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are one big family, big and small, old and young are welcome here".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Exercise keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol.
Analog in Dialog - The Limits of the Digital
With advancing digitalization, some people are once again turning to analog technology
The rapidity with which our everyday lives have become digital has left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our ways of communicating and working to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you were one of the lucky six percent who had a private line. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a phone call to your relatives for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic receiver and the clicking of the coins in the machine were unforgettable. My greatest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economist now has 14 days to do so. Until now, Recean has been one of the president's advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was opposed by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for their "enormous sacrifice."
Moldova is Ukraine's neighbor and is suffering the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, Veitshöchheim will once again be celebrating in style. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities did not let themselves be asked for long.
Bavaria's father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume would suggest. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side, wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister for the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, chose the children's hero Chase from Paw Patrol for his costume.
Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely off the beaten track: Minister for Science and the Arts Markus Blume is drawn to space.
State parliament president Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as the model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder aka Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She was wearing silver.
He even plays the sheriff at carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side, wife Gerswid.
On the road: Economics Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, District Administrator of Regensburg, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missing either.
All for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD parliamentary party leader's pleasure: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres.
Martin Hagen, head of the FDP parliamentary group, was a royal. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, Manfred Weber, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, was on the road as a pantomime. At his side wife Andrea.
If it doesn't work out with politics, at least he can do magic. Nuremberg's mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermione.
A bee on the move: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: BR's legal director Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR cultural program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side blow against the climate activists from the Franconian Tatort commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the first mayor of Veitshöchheim was not to be missed. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in world championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and won also the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Cup titles and continues to close the gap to his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partly heavy fog did not prevent permanent winner Bö to collect already his second gold at the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay team had already successfully defended its title.
Hardly anyone doubts that in the pursuit race number three will follow. In the pursuit Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding so that he can compensate shooting mistakes to a certain extent frighteningly easy.
For Doll, meanwhile, nothing went right again. After the veteran missed all chances for a medal in the mixed relay and finished only sixth, it didn't go any better three days later. Three penalties already in prone shooting and two more in standing were a big disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago he surprisingly won by a razor-thin margin of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career victories for Doll, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Beijing Olympic eighth-placed skier pulled away wordlessly after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the main topic is the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
U.S. President Joe Biden has insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit to his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula countered, referring to his right-wing predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, "Brazil has isolated itself for four years."
Lula, a left-wing politician, won a runoff election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1. The transfer of power was accompanied by heavy rioting. Bolsonaro's supporters had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the U.S. Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently invaded the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. He said his predecessor didn't pay much attention to international relations. "His world began and ended with Fake News, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "Sounds familiar," Biden countered - an obvious reference to his predecessor in office, Trump.
Short note about the press - the Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? You could see the members of the Red Army Faction on them, cleared for denunciation and firing.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, the public mood was created in this way against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Here nothing to the really dangerous in pinstripe suit and tie).
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually rather after Raudis in the suburban trains or onanists in the park, gives a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is badly informed, because there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that is not the point, but: On place 1 to 5 (!) is Ms. Wagenknecht, then follows Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone around me who reads this paper anymore. If they did, it would be high time now. We have reached the familiar level where there is nothing below.
And at the latest now, well dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely dumbed-down, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here now no more differentiation is necessary).
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this in the same wording to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL. It says: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for the dissolution of his civil partnership with the competent court via his family lawyer. I do not comment on details".
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, separation rumors had been around for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from the house they shared in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems in the RTL show.
SS massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane: last survivor dead
A memorial center was set up in 1999 in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins remain. France's President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended France's values, Macron said. He had also contributed to Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had promoted Franco-German youth encounters.
One curve location for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ series North Lippe hamlets: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, the residents find pure idyll. In the summer, 300 motorcycles a day roar along the winding road between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some back again.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing believes further interest rate hikes are "absolutely" necessary in the fight against high inflation. "Inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro zone for the fifth time in succession and held out the prospect of a further increase of 0.5 percentage points at its meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area now stands at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate, which commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB, is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can curb demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher interest rates on loans can lead to investments being postponed and thus to weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of sustained high inflation are much more serious than higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we have to keep that in mind, but high debt levels should not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area in the medium term at an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. Although inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area, which now comprises 20 countries, were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce consumers' purchasing power, because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharp increases in energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "sooner or later collapse," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks (BdB). "This is where I currently see the greatest danger for the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "German pace" for infrastructure projects proclaimed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialog on this. And it will perhaps also be a bit more controversial," he told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Stuttgart. He said he hoped that, in the end, a set of rules would emerge that, while not necessarily as fast as the LNG terminals that went into operation around the turn of the year, would not be as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supplies caused by a lack of Russian gas deliveries. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new "German pace" on the occasion. In addition, the German government had recently launched an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that shouldn't automatically mean that from now on we always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will," Hartung said. There must therefore still be a negotiation process as to what is right and wrong as a society, he added.
In the past, he said, they had tried and failed with the classic set of rules. "We should think again about whether the previous approach was right. Perhaps we overdid it with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves.
In view of the many unfinished tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the German government and the companies involved, however, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns of breakup of Bayer Group
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a breakup of the group after an announced change of chief executive at Bayer. "From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three pillars, is positioned exactly right for the challenges of the future," Francesco Grioli, a member of the union's executive board and a member of Bayer's supervisory board, told the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceuticals business with prescription medicines, the consumer health business with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "You can only manage the transformation of the industry with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism."
The background to this is the change of chief executive at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will leave his post this summer. The ex-pharmaceutical boss of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been criticized. The acquisition of the U.S. seed producer Monsanto for $63 billion, completed in 2018, hangs over the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen company had brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into the house. Bayer's stock had been on a downward slide for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to approve the actions of the CEO at the annual general meeting.
It had been known for some time that Baumann was not seeking to extend his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Pressure had been exerted by long-term strategic investors. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split-up of the Group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the "Rheinische Post" newspaper. By contrast, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop Science agricultural division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands plan to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing the government's plan with a concentrated protest in the streets. Hundreds of thousands plan to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are again expected to demonstrate across the country on Saturday against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the center government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, more than a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 people took part in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in parliament for the past week.
Many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid into the pension scheme long enough to receive a full pension by the time they reach that age. In many strenuous jobs, people could hardly work longer, opponents of the reform say. In addition, employees want to be able to enjoy their well-earned pensions and not wear out their health completely on the job.
Macron: Threat of deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older and older, employees will have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order to keep the pension level stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But it is not just the retirement age that the government wants to tighten. The increase in the period needed to pay into a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1,200 euros.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, and even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron had already tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were a certainty for all of them.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push the reform through with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced support. But some of the deputies - even from Macron's faction - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote at the moment may be Macron's concern about crippling strikes. Ahead of Saturday's renewed demonstrations, the president said he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility to keep them calm and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sunshine at high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that lots of sunshine can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explained meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "Admittedly, this high pressure shifts a little to the east in the course of the next week. However, it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, Übel says. "Such a high pressure can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands dreary high fog gray for days, while there is pure sun in the high altitudes of the low mountains."
Thus, Sunday will start foggy and cloudy in most regions. From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it may also rain a little, according to the DWD. Especially at the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover will clear up during the day and the sun will appear more and more often. In the rest of the country, it will remain cloudy or overcast with high fog. Temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine around 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually getting stronger, will nibble at the high fog again and will be able to clear it more and more during the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sunshine is expected throughout the day, while elsewhere it will first have to fight its way through the high fog cover. The highs will be 5 to 9 degrees, around 11 degrees in the Lower Rhine area, but only around 3 degrees in the permanent gray in the southeast. In addition, a weak wind will blow from different directions.
On Tuesday, there may again be only tenacious dissipation of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be clear after the fog has dissipated. In high areas, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and at the edge of the Alps, the sun will shine all day according to the forecast. Temperatures will rise to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominator struggles: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
Defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia has expressed serious disappointment after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't give the performance I'm capable of," the Italian said on ZDF after she threaded a gate and was eliminated. At least the 30-year-old was just able to avoid a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill racer in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six races in this discipline so far this season. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky skiing, will have to wait further for a World Cup medal in her parade discipline. She missed her home event in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second," Goggia said after the surprising victory of Switzerland's Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France, now. "I am disappointed. I gave everything I had. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for information about her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the public for help in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station at around 12:30 p.m. on February 10, 2023. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of the German language and the local area.

Selenskyj and ministers against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. Sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by calling for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be excluded from the 2024 Olympics in Paris.
It was agreed at a joint conference call to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Sports Ministry said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place at the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made the UK's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue."
Earlier, at an international video conference of sports ministers and other senior officials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Selenskyj said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of Russia's war of aggression, he said, ultimately even a neutral flag is soaked in blood and cannot be worn.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a warring party because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selensky called on officials to work to protect Olympic principles and prevent the admission of Russian athletes to competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), saying it has "unfortunately lost its honesty."
The conference was prompted by the IOC's announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott should the IOC allow the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, said afterwards that it had also reiterated during the consultations that it would refuse to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competition. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to have the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's effort to readmit Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way to go," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told dpa in response to a query.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be kept separate.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" would violate the ban on discrimination.

"Hey, hot ass!", whistling after the fool in the skimpy sexy costume and shouting lewd sayings: All this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind the term is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow's tank inventory severely depleted
Half of vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow's tank stock severely depleted
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the war began. There is talk of "half of the main stock".
The Russian Army has already lost half of its main battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to U.S. Defense Department estimates. "Probably half of the Russian army's main inventory of tanks" has been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary for international security affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide further details on the number of tanks the U.S. estimates have been seized and destroyed at an online event hosted by the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. The UK has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2 battle tanks in March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, their delivery will in all likelihood take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev held out the prospect of building and modernizing thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging abroad for aircraft, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now vice head of the Russian Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be geared more closely to the needs of the armed forces. This means, for example, that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil over appointment to Army post
The post, which will be held by the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM), Christian Ortner, was not advertised. Herwig Jedlaucnik, the academy's staff representative, suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
An advertisement was not necessary because the appointment was to a previously vacant position, she said. She did not want to comment on "speculations by a liberal staff representative." Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he faced serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these have been cleared up.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. Ortner is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision has the "appearance of a job scam," says SPÖ military spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos demand Tanner to take back the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go down before costs
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says carnival president Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total costs for the parade.
No carnival parades are cancelled in Brandenburg. The "Zug der fröhlichen Leute" (procession of merry people) in Cottbus, probably once again eastern Germany's largest, will take place for the first time since the pandemic. No parades have been canceled at the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to its traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We're going through with our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But here, too, financial worries are pressing: if no more sponsors were found or the previous ones contributed even more, reserves would have to be touched - "that's not possible every year." The current deficit is about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: some confectionery prices have risen by up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther from the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. By a stroke of luck, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. For the procession, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. Twice as many personnel will be needed for security as in 2020.
Anyone standing on the side of the road at the Rosenmontag parade in the Rhineland could get fewer Kamelle than in the past. Because sweets have become more expensive, some parade participants don't have as much with them. Candy or not, the number of visitors is likely to be high: "I think that if it doesn't rain cats and dogs on that day, we can definitely expect an increased number of people," says Holger Kirsch, the head of the Cologne procession. "That's due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Shrove Monday procession for two years. Of course, there is no substitute for the procession."
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. However, the train is generally "loss-making", that is no secret.
The Ukraine diary: dreams and home-made vodka
Ukrainians are not considered hard drinkers for nothing. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't detect a big difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely available. They distill it themselves here, especially in the villages. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a staggering 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here how little you can believe the Russians. They say that tourists should be careful with it. But that only applies when it goes on sale en masse. Then there is probably also adulterated.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards high effort: "Match luck on our side".
Food and drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer at the end of the day, you will find great places to do so in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work get-togethers or pre-glow for club parties. Where is the best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees favorite win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Cup sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to tell from the VIP stand on Saturday whether the targets on the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to get the results on my cell phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, referring to the fog that kept drifting into the stadium and greatly impaired the view of the spectators at the Rennsteig.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed attending the 10-km sprint race at the World Biathlon Championships in Oberhof, getting plenty of tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Ever since the Olympics in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, biathlon has fascinated me," he revealed, and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The rebuilt arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say that - with thanks to those who have lent a hand here since the World Championships were awarded." In terms of sustainability, too, the site is now "one step ahead of many others" and thus "safe for the years and even decades to come".
In terms of sport, Norway's Johannes Thingnes Bö once again outdistanced the competition. Despite a penalty loop after a shooting mistake he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Cup title in Oberhof. Behind him his brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds behind) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 miss/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting mistake and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. In contrast, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his failed mixed event on Wednesday, the Black Forest athlete missed five targets this time and disappeared into the dressing room in 55th place, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö had started the race with the number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However: He was lucky with his last two standing shots; they both landed on the edge of the targets and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year older brother: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In the women's race, however, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "When you start with the number one spot, the goal is not to come in tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one spot," sports director Felix Bitterling took his "locomotive" to task. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych rules on a dropped ball.
Aggressive players or grumbling coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the way players interact on the pitch. "I do think that there are new behaviors of players who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told Deutsche Presse-Agentur. "We discussed that during the winter break. We decided that we will not accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to that again - and will also sanction it."
Two coaches were also recently sent off. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat to FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "The coach's behavior also falls into the area of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsportsmanlike conduct consistently," Brych said.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a basically good cooperation between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. Then the person concerned has to live with that. That should be nothing earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
"Conflicts can certainly arise from emotionality in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referees," Fröhlich said. In recent cases, he said, the parties involved have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be important if a process of rethinking were to get underway that such behavior is simply not appropriate," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible repercussions at another level. "Of course, incidents from professional soccer always rub off. There's a role model effect, imitation results from that. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, referees have reacted consistently to negative behavior," Fröhlich said. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined athlete Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race by Jens Luraas Oftebro of Norway ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined athletes will not be at their best in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek will not be there. They are preparing with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will be held from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven lightly injured after rear-end collision on A5 motorway
Seven people were slightly injured, including two children, in a four-car accident on the Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhine-Neckar district). According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist crashed into a car from behind during a slight tailback, pushing it onto two other cars. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours, it said.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
Initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition ends at the Marler Skulpturenmuseum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage to the exhibition "Wallbound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarters of the Marler Skulpturenmuseum at Georg-Herwegh-Strasse 63-67. In each of three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalog documents the works created especially for the Marl Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-based art in the service of the community. On the basis of numerous pictorial examples, she will present the special features of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the lines of connection to this art genre in the Federal Republic with a focus on NRW from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who completed her doctorate on mural painting in the Weimar Republic in 2013. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the postwar period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on Kunst am Bau in NRW. The lecture will be followed by the final curatorial tour of the exhibition. The artists will be on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that contributed to the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in southern Turkey for possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued for 33 people, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported Saturday, citing law enforcement officials. The defendants are believed to be responsible for construction defects that may have contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the suspects was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He allegedly tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye, according to the report.
Early on Monday morning, a 7.7-magnitude quake hit the Turkish-Syrian border region, followed by another 7.6-magnitude quake at midday. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Last but one Minister President of the GDR Hans Modrow died
Hans Modrow is dead, according to the Left Party in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Parliamentary group chairman Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Linke politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," the left-wing parliamentary group in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party thus loses "an important personality," said Dietmar Bartsch, chairman of the parliamentary group, and Gregor Gysi, former parliamentary group leader.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As prime minister, he saw the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became chairman of the GDR's Council of Ministers - for about 150 days. In the Volkskammer elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded as the last prime minister of the GDR until reunification by CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
Dietmar Bartsch, the parliamentary group leader of the Left Party, described Modrow as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist" in a message on the short message service Twitter. Bartsch added:
"Until his old age, he was an important advisor in our party whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was precisely a special merit of his. That will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. They go on to say:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of also representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa), Modrow had taken a "thoroughly critical" view of the new state. German unity had been achieved too quickly, the GDR had gone down too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow had criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened during the night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's power grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, the head of the Ukrenerho power company, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television Friday evening. He said the power supply in the Kharkiv region was particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor unit had to be shut down at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant, and production was curtailed at the Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Selensky condemned Friday's Russian attack with some 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. In a video message, however, he told his countrymen how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to abandon the small town of Bachmut
February 24 will mark one year of war. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. Meanwhile, the threat of Russian missile attacks continued into Saturday night. An air alert was sounded in the capital Kiev late Friday night for the fifth time for the day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kiev region announced. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, during the election campaign to spin it off failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, a compromise was reached on an infrastructure company that would, however, be oriented toward the common good in the future. This means that it does not have to generate and transfer profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government accompany this process. The backlog of renovations to the rail network is a major reason why the railroads are currently running very unpunctually. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this deplorable state of affairs by completely refurbishing entire rail corridors. The investment required for this has so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, the figure is closer to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances had apparently not been in Herrmann-Wick's favor. She had slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited," and her pulse had not come down during the run-in. "Such a race", and that at the home World Championships, "cannot be described in words", she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to booming pop music with German flags, coaches and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", that's what she had set out to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Cup as Germany's biggest, if not only, medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. She is currently ranked fifth in the overall World Cup. And even if the performance density in the women's top is significantly higher than in the men's, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate at the moment, others were rather on the cards for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the leftist head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people had died in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the U.S. government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special assets
As a result, the first defense projects have already been canceled, and further projects are threatened with the same, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag. However, it is not yet possible to say which specific investments will be cancelled. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible savings requirement at this stage," reads a response from the German government to a question from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment amount is rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which the Bundestag approved in June 2022, has to bear the interest charges for the loans itself. If these rise, less money will be available for concrete acquisitions for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation is reducing the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 o'clock, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell freeway slip road in the direction of Heilbronn onto the freeway. At that time, a 21-year-old female VW driver was driving on the B19 in the direction of Künzelsau, according to police. When the BMW driver turned, the two vehicles collided.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic lights installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system did not reveal any objections. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident. They had to be admitted to hospital. The two cars were damaged to a total of around 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart commemorate the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria preoccupies the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people remembered the victims and prayed for them in Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many members of the community had responded to the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's supplication seriously and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction. The congregation also requested assistance and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib stands by the side of the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial service. The prayers of supplication were also translated into German at the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in kind over several days in Glockenstraße, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. For those who, thanks to their home office, are not sitting in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least, that's the impression you get around Lake Egglburg, where more than just dog owners can be found between 12 and 2 p.m.
One reason, of course, could be that modern man, in the course of an optimal use of time slots, can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things. After all, why not take a short walk through nature to hear news about the settlement from a neighbor you haven't seen in a long time? Or meet the friend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? This is also a good way to combine work and private life - who says that an appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor can't take place outdoors? Provided there are no foreign ears in the vicinity, of course.
What you can also do very well is to buy something in kind. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands on a table along the way, along with a small box. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid only if one did not consider the purchase already in the apron and made appropriate arrangements. Thus, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer with empty hands and regret in his voice. "Too bad, we have unfortunately forgotten the money".
You can understand the disappointment, since you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. You also let the friendly chance acquaintance know this. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! You very well have a bag with you!" Thereby he points to the hood of the jacket, which one has thrown on quickly before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional head covering superfluous. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one starts the way back with a meat insert and has become richer during this midday short excursion not only by a saddle of lamb, but also by a decidedly practical idea. It's quite possible that a second walk will be due that day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road towards Hailfingen and, for reasons as yet unexplained, left the road to the right in a left-hand bend, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a delineator, crashed into the side of a tree and came to a stop a few meters away. The collision trapped the driver in his car. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. The rescue service took the seriously injured man to a hospital. As there was a suspicion of impaired driving, a blood sample was taken. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has ruled: The Internal Revenue Service must turn over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
Trump in 2018, then still in office as president of the U.S.
The Treasury Department must direct the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to release the confidential records to the Finance and Revenue Committee, the decision Department said Friday.
In contradiction to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax returns public either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted disclosure all the way to the Supreme Court. A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public from them - unless it came to a trial.
The disclosure to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: There, the circle of those authorized to access the information is somewhat larger, and under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information from the parliament is also repeatedly leaked to the outside.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president," Pelosi declared.
Cabaret at the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which cell phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves to time, today's people rush from appointment to appointment, sometimes shoving people and hamburgers in between just like that. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting.
In a humorous and thoughtful way Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and crisply pointed cabaret songs, she gets to the heart of a lot of things - and one or two things are also written between the lines. It all starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30 p.m. in the Kirchheimer Club Bastion.
British felon caught in Thailand after long escape
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. According to the British Criminal Investigation Agency (NCA) on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police officers at a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "most wanted" list of criminals.
The leader of a criminal group had fled in early 2018 ahead of the start of a court trial in which he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros), according to authorities.
Meetings at the church table
Bielefeld
What is served remains a secret in advance. After all, people should come to the Vesperkirche first and foremost to meet others, not because there is something specific on the menu. This Sunday is the start, then the Marienkirche in Neustadt becomes a dining hall for two weeks.
Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, by his own admission, loves Viennese humor, takes up the cudgels for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits this. Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic skepticism about science here remains to be seen. In any case, his humor fits very well in Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's more recent life story, as he spent a year in New York in 2019 trying to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian. Now, however, he's back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but also explains what Wissenaft actually is and what it can and, above all, what it can't do. Of course, Corona is mentioned, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many put off: What is really important? He does all this with a huge wink, in an unagitated and very ironic way. And so we are not only well entertained, but can also learn something in the process.
Please go for typing... it doesn't take long, doesn't hurt and can save many people's lives.
My cell phone rings with an unknown number. I assume. This woman is the honest finder of her wallet.
Further the Nordcon team writes: "In contrast to our old location we have very few stairs.
MdB Pfeiffer calls climate protection a substitute religion. May even be true, because I love this planet and its civilization more than some abstract god.
Ten firefighters and two police officers were injured in the explosion, some of them seriously.
I can dismiss it all as harmless quirkiness. You don't do that to children.
It's a good thing that for decades the city's politicians have been aware of the advantages and have never questioned them.
Peace and Security at the Turn of the Times? On Monday, May 15 at 6:00 p.m., the Solidarische Kirche, the Friedensplenum and the ev. Stadtakademie invite you to a lecture and discussion event at the Ev. Hochschule on the topic "Peace and Security in the Turn of Times?"
I really don't understand why people don't do events like this on Sunday. Or not in the city.
What doesn't the #Bahn actually do to scare away customers and mess up the image even more!?
Brilliant how well #LuisaNeubauer sums it up. We need exactly such people. Thank you Luisa!
Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard gives details and prices of monetization <URL> #DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of various stripes will travel to Germany together (!) for the first time.
I am curious who I will meet there and who I will get to know there ;-)
Party colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer eleven, as well as the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, who is also a CDU minister.
This is really nothing new, it is the same with every electronic ticket. Checkin/checkout is a different story.
Certainly no reason to do anything about the tax evasion of 150 billion euros per year in Germany alone.
Does anyone play #wortify and found the word with all letters today? If so, please let me know, it's driving me crazy right now.
I haven't written anything for a long time, the search for a suitable job has taken up all my resources.

1. general
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle action from the tank driver's point of view. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and ashlars, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which, during the extended gameplay, are increasingly difficult to hit. Additionally, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction run, the game initiation run, the game abl on, the initial entry for high scores, and the self-test run. The latter mode is a special procedure for checking the controls and computer operation.
4. gameplay
The game sequence is triggered when the START pushbutton is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds become audible. When the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slowly moving tanks becoming visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of each enemy tank or missile by paying attention to the superimposed text in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. A hint may read, for example: ENEMY FROM RIGHT. In addition, a dot representing the enemy position becomes visible on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to aim at on the screen. Furthermore, ANYONE IN THE FIELD OF FIRE is simultaneously displayed in the upper left hint display.
At times, UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless flying objects that observe the battle and cannot eliminate the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. UFO's are meant to round out the combat action and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. One shot down by the player earns the player 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are scored: for a slow moving tank 1,000 points, for a missile 2,000 points and for a super tank 3,000 points. A super tank travels and turns twice as fast as the player tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several options give the player the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks in one game. Furthermore, a bonus tank can be released after reaching pre-set scores and the appearance of the missile can be varied for a more difficult game design. Details and the exact switch positions of the game sequence selector for this setting option can be seen in the figure.
5. initial input for highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of maximum scores, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials in the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that if a self-test is triggered, the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector-Generator PCB is pressed, or the mains power is interrupted, the table with the highest results will be cleared. When cleared (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores are preserved with their initials and reinscribed on the screen to challenge other players. Any score , above 100,000, will also be marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer automatically inscribes dashes. After this, the machine switches back to the attraction game sequence. SET-UP
1. new parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you have previous experience with ATARI video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI control lever. It has been strengthened by several additional ribs in the inner and outer case sections, making this assembly more stable and ensuring proper operation of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always returns the control lever to the center position. The microswitches are now fastened with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuitry has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator board and the Auxiliary board. Using this switching technique, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and steady image. C. Power Supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the expansion of the circuitry. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, which is intended as a platform for smaller players, in order to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum stability of the device at the installation site.
These new parts, as well as all other main assemblies of this device are shown on the figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should perform some inspection to round off the quality control. To be certain that the unit has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be made: NOTE: Do not connect the unit to the 220 V mains yet. A. Inspect exterior of housing for damage. B. Open unit maintenance door and inspect components inside unit as follows: (1) Check all harness connectors for proper and tight connection. Connect any open or loose connectors together.
NOTE: Never force plug connections. The plugs are provided with a positive guide so that a correct connection is made. A connector connection twisted by 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check plug connections to the game PC board for correct and tight fit. (3) Note the manufacturing number of the unit on the nameplate on the back of the unit. Check that the stamped manufacturing number matches those on the Battlezone Analog Vector-Generator PC board, Auxiliary PC board, Controller/Audio II PC board, and TV monitor. An illustration of where the manufacturing number is located is provided on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control panel and the TV monitor for proper installation. (5) Finally, the unit must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the viewing glass of the player, check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright opening of the casing, circled in orange. If the opening is not exactly centered, the fairing, which is attached to the housing with tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before connecting the instrument to the mains supply, make sure that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Check the system configuration
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. You can use the DirectX Diagnostic program to get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements. To access the DirectX Diagnostics program, please follow these steps: Click the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. Type "dxdiag" in the text box. Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphics and sound cards. Among other things, you can check if graphics and sound are working properly by clicking the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
It can happen that other programs hog the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are started automatically when the system boots. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. That is why we recommend you to close such background applications before you start the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, locate the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable" "Close", or similar). - Once you disable the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to stop all unnecessary background applications". Clean up the system
Before you install any software, you need to make sure that your hard disk is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Then chances are that current games will run mostly smoothly on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage of running much more efficiently, so other applications you use will run faster and more stably. Consult the Windows help files to learn about the ScanDisk or Error Check, Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. click on the "Start" button and select the "Help" option (or "Help and Support") to access the Windows Help. 2. now click in the search box and type the appropriate keyword, e.g. "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Check" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmenter" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive instructions explaining how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try downloading the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website. Below you can find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

Hold down the CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press DEL. Now the Windows Task Manager is displayed. 2. to end a background application, switch to the "applications" tab, click on the corresponding entry in the task list and then on the "end task" button. Before you call the hotline
If you want to call, you should sit down at your PC and have the following information ready (see section "Checking the system configuration"). Please also prepare note material. - PC make and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (working memory) - Information about graphics and sound card and drivers.
INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
The desire to create video games was sparked by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a host of new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression through which to push the world to its limits. It was a way for me to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be perfectly honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games were exploiting only a tiny fraction of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too focused on "action" and forgetting about a fundamental element of the human experience: sensation. Meanwhile, technology continued to advance rapidly. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that transmits sensations. Although this could have been done in a completely different way, of course, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that you can indeed create an interactive gaming experience that isn't just based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting boxes to get ammo, but has far more challenging and in-depth content. It's proof that you can both tell a story and offer gameplay content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements because of it. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help you change your attitude. May other developers also feel the desire to follow this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything yet. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, where we have been forced time and again to question many of the principles previously considered irrevocable. I would be happy if Fahrenheit - much like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also leaves a mark on you. David Cage

Gameplay
Pressing the corresponding start button starts the game for one or (with minimum credit 2) for 2 players. You must try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game flow is set so that a minimum prescribed area must be taken before the next area (round) can be tackled. At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. When an alarm is sounded, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, while you are trying to draw your area, your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross your own path, or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will be lit and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. If the drawing speed is slow, the points will be doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to check itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working properly. See "Service Program" for more information. The volume can be adjusted at the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing the - in the device - 4 switches, the Self-Test button and the LED's on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The "Sub-Test" switch can be used to set the languages. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to go to the next program display. Deployment Programming. This display can be used to set the difficulty factor for the game. It can also be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that may be before the game starts. The line to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the value desired for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. The factory or basic setting can be reached by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times, when the lowest line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the green appearing lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to transfer the High Score pointr to the next program display until "High Score so far". This value determines the required score/hit number for a player to enter their own initials (name) and hit points on the screen. The "Maximum number of credit" determines a coin acceptance limit for the machine. If the limit is exceeded, coin acceptance is disabled - if coin lock is present. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin the credits cannot become zero if added above 99. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum number of credits" to O. Other programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": level of the % number that must be reached to switch to the next pass.
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": degree of difficulty of the gameplay.
"Attract sound": at "0" no sound in standby mode
at "1" sound also at stand mode (animated sound) "table model": at "0" stand model
for "1" table device
Credits per coin are set on the "Insert Slot Programming" display. High Score Programming Display ("Highest Hit Rate So Far"). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set to high score selected on the previous display (set from "back"). Pressing the "Up" button sets the initials QIX standard. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "total evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of credits paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can appear at 0 only if the battery or the connector W1 are removed, with the power off. Left side coins: Number of coins inserted - in the left coin insertion slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-side coins: Number of coins inserted - in the right coin slot. Credits paid: number of credits given for coins inserted (revalued). Credits granted: number of credits given by the machine. % Free Spins: Credits awarded (Paid + credits awarded per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Won minutes: Number of minutes, in case of extended or won game. % Free Time: Minutes won/ minutes played per 100. Average Game Time in sec: Minutes played/ credits paid + credits granted.
High Score: Number of times a player has had a high enough hit rate to knock other players off the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears.
Insert slot programming/normal coin setting. Using this display, a default coin setting can be selected by the operator or another setting can be programmed
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches selects the programming while the top digit lights green on the screen. The size values change as the digit changes. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is accepted. If a setting other than the standard setting is desired, the values can be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and changing only those values that do not fit. Once the adjustment is made, any new value to be adjusted can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. If pressed inadvertently, the default setting will appear. The "Up" and "Down" switches can be used to increase or decrease the values. By pressing the "Test" switch the process is finished. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") tells how many coin units are given for each coin inserted - through an assigned slot. Coin units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a credit is given. "Bonus" coin units shows the units required before a bonus credit is issued. "Min coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM in which all programming is stored has failed. All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory default settings. This condition probably indicates battery failure or error.
MISSING SEARCHES AND SETTINGS
Start the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" button or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" switch, the next program is displayed in each case. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the auto-test mode. In this program, the unit will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" display appears, the program connector J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. If connector J 19 is disconnected, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is error high, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decode connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt holds with the above display, an error was detected. If the Communications RAM's fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by faulty wiring (RAM) or errors in the Data Board. To locate the fault, remove Data-Board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: error in U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test was passed, all memory locations are set to their former value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers follow are checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these writes are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancy will cause the program to stop and the LEDs will indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnostic does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LED's), it indicates that the next test is being started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without visible seam defects. BUT I have probably looked forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. Had oriented me on the basis of the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it is to sit so tight and I did not want to fight with my bust size in a S or M.... In the end, it would have fit from the length and at the hip...in the rest I could swim. In addition, the lining material came to one already when opening the package and spread everywhere. Just a shame.. It is sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it well from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and her fits the 36 in this case quite well and will certainly still worn the next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I opted for the gummiauflage c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the support does not quite fit. But that is my fault. Have then slightly changed something so that it fits. The support seems very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the whole surface. Has worked without problems. It slips nothing more. I would buy again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself I quite okay, but not under one year. Since the surface for chewing is much too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months and he could not use him because of the size. Now at 12 months we got him out again and he can use it. Has also not been able to bite anything yet with his teeth already a few. And when he was in the fridge, it calms him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately goes back
I have probably been blinded by the partly effusive reviews here. I would like to say in advance that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large (to store the equipment) and a fairly small for the most important, everyday things that you just take. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro is now finally too small and I need a replacement. At Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, I had read through many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can not say. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, this is simply not true! I really hoped that it would, but there is really no question of it. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. Oh the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more unstable. Overall, the feel of this backpack is nothing like my Lowepro. Also the zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small stuff are not exactly high quality. Therefore, I have decided for me that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment of many thousands of EUR, then I must unfortunately also take the money for a decent backpack in hand. Quality here apparently has its price. For someone who does not want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like I had a hard time deciding either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked is the color inside. You can definitely find your stuff much faster here than with a gray interior. For someone who has other demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
So far I had liked the Elektrik series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also recommendable and had really looked forward to the third part. This part is all about Volt and Taylor's feelings and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has had a crush on Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself, and then is like a little kid every time there's a fight, and she just goes away! At the same time there were inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and that he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that then finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is the ex of Volt. That would bring more tension into the story.
Man destroys everything, appreciates nothing and does not learn! First of all: Sooo bad the film is not now, as many write. Of course, the story is totally constructed, and again and again after the same scheme F konzepiert. If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and appreciates nothing, and does not learn! And this is exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often did I think during the film (and that although I know that it is only a film, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there often shoot one already the tears in the eyes. From there Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is already really neatly done. It's just a shame that people don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream movie. We are consistently destroying animals and the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. For greed and profit, and stupidity and arrogance ! Empathy for the environment and living creatures :missing. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always after the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be. This film is first and foremost "French" - it is also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you let yourself get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that does not matter. 5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, but purely nothing. My abdominal girth has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has remained for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller package size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, with the larger full 5 ? This is very very strange!
terrible smell and little result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint to a chocolate brown, in February / March I used this hair color remover. I have used the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out an in about chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it, as in the instructions even if not satisfied result, another time. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like it did the first time I tried it. What was the very worst, it still stunk weeks after application.... No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't go away.
Highly recommended
I take the tablets now for a long time and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a prolonged additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by healthy food but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 something on the jump. This works also in a very good way. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not quite flawless !!! After 3 months of use of the battery case I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very annoying: 1) The case has over time problems to "connect" with the phone. This means that it no longer charges even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and reinstalling it solves the problem in 70% of cases, but creates a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and re-installing the phone in the case, the cover has now become so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. These are not many major defects, but I think that a case with battery should work properly just in its function and therefore I am, for the cost of 30 €, very disappointed in the product, especially because I only use it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I do not know how all these good reviews come about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get at any optician in a slightly smaller form gift. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I have promised me much more of these cloths it is also really very very thin. Since I have used it I can unfortunately no longer exchange it I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far exaggerated more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (me shcon fallen into the shower), gives bass like bass again, Bluetooth works great ... Suction cup you have to water of course, otherwise it loosens... he can play sound very loud.... yes... what I see critical is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of vocals almost hurt the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. My old speaker didn't reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were presented fairly naturally in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to deduct one star. I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
In a few places, the paint was chipped and if you just went over it with your hand, the paint went right off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up free of charge because we no longer wanted to have them, but unfortunately only at our expense. they would only replace the damaged parts but how if both chest of drawers was damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon has done it all for us and transferred us the money back. A LOB to Amazon
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Delivered are individual parts which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the letter carrier has stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I did not complain about it, because I needed this product urgently. The supplied adhesive hardly holds, but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which, however, does not become hard. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least this 5 days after gluing was still not dry), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. The templates are partially incomplete punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high-quality product.
Am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + magnetic closures + nice look + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired.
- Doors bang due to magnets (might be possible to compensate with rubber studs) - some unclean spots
- Supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no other and have them since no cup was in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (habs with some paper wrapped and balanced) Conclusion: If he would not look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. In addition, I find him then also a little too expensive.
The coffee tastes me....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have awarded 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly through (if at all!). Also, the additional plastic waste (individually packaged s.Photo) means for me a star deduction. I hope the manufacturer changes this and cashes soon full score.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds are terrible, and exceedingly loud at that. I could not turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned to face the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. The colors and also the color change I found beautiful, unfortunately you can not dim the colored light. I also found it good that it has a battery, so that in the event of a power failure, the clock and the alarm time must not be re-entered. Went back but for the reasons mentioned.
Light super, processing insufficient
I have replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - receive 4" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled this accommodatingly and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. Thus, I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two stars deduction. The light itself is super. The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated. The light color goes rather in the direction of cold white. For hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc perfect. For living rooms I would personally reach for warmer light. Quite comparable with a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also and evtl I get there also intact copies according to the order. If my evaluation should be a help, I am pleased about a positive evaluation. Questions I try to answer quickly.
Great
I have received gestures and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I have long thought about whether I order this set, or not. ** The material is sturdy and it feels good in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang them **The soft silicone will not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially handy to use on pans with coatings. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. **They also do not pass on the heat and thus can be touched directly. **The dishwasher, however, sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone. But shortly after wipe and they are gone. Finally I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-goods sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping simply top. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked.dabei we found that the part has already been installed. At all assembly parts, we have significant scratches, abrasions have to determine. The screw connections / connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that also on the chrome faucet itself is scratch marks / streaks to see. This part was probably already delivered and sent back again. We keep this faucet and install in the sink in the basement because there it does not matter how it looks. Our conclusion; Never again we order such goods through Amazon but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we get Ordentliche goods. Find it just sad that customers are so screwed!!!
Product itself top, outdoor sensor unfortunately already broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device which measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be still intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably broken, because it always displays completely astronomical outdoor humidity values. This is a pity, since the device was installed outside in a protected place and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak catcher bag
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery As of today, still blithely drives with Hermes through the republic without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service of Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly to me and made a quality impression. The engine is strong and it gives a nice cutting pattern. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but ok. Big drawback is unfortunately the catcher bag. For one thing, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you put it down full just briefly, then of course it gets compressed and parts of the contents fall out. But what's worse is that the actually practical fill level indicator already shows red when the catcher bag is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Emptying the basket every time it is half full on a large lawn cannot be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the catch basket makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate via the app. Very good is the supplied plug-in sensor cable, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to save battery only once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. I give only 4 stars for the following reasons. - The soft back panel of the device, which also closes the battery compartment can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses its connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed correctly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high and the front right screw falls out, because it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the trolley are straight as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what can be done, because it is impossible to print anything. To the construction: The construction was quite problem-free one could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to lay them several times again, which is very exhausting. Support I have also written but after a week of waiting still no answer. Send back is unfortunately no longer possible. Had expected something more.
robust and precise am positively surprised
My old caliper has unfortunately given up the ghost after many years, so had to get a new one. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Included are two batteries, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but completely fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods. I can only give full marks for it and believe it lasts at least as long as the old caliper. From me there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor
Bought the bracelet and have not worn for the time being, because it exudes a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell is not gone, although it was constantly "aired". After return no longer possible, I have disposed of it. Advise against purchase
For the price ok
The stars and spheres on this necklace are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks quite massive. The larger ball are freely movable, which I find again quite nice. However, the chain is processed overall very simple, so that I have already torn open the closure twice. So far I could always repair him again, but I think that will not go well / hold for a long time. But for the low price you can expect simply also nothing really high quality.
Very beautiful jewel
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't come undone, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, this makes it a little softer and more supple. Only: who has something magnetic on the arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after some playing.... If you follow the instructions, it does not work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station again and inserted a new one, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because already after an hour the connection was gone again, and that although the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all for me so not to use! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase in any case, brings only trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump once before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off. I bought it again for only one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line as well as the discharge line would fit. I hope the shaft on the previous pump had a manufacturing defect and the current pump will do its job a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had shipping damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the vents broken. The box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future rather than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance.
Could have been thought through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than running around all the time with a huge bunch of keys. At the beginning everything went quite well. However, the paint came off pretty quickly and the screws always had to be retightened. It's nice that this can be done with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. A suitable slotted screwdriver I have not found, which would not have immediately ruined the whole screw. Now to come to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. Nice is that through the different parts, the screw can be set to different sizes or lengths, but if you have the whole thing screwed together, you need a pair of pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. The attachment of the key itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. Ultimately, the third time I mount the screw in the thread is broken off and thus the entire thing unusable. Conclusion: If at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the specified dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material seems sturdy and all in featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will be able to actually judge the goods only after the first use. In advance I can already say that the height is lower than specified. At the moment I can not really imagine to pack everything there, for example, for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really big parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, because in the round cosmetic bag still two smaller bags / sachets were included. Not high quality processing, I wanted to mention that anyway. That the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags, I personally do not mind. The price-performance ratio I see as a trial price and that's ok.
So lala
So, ordered before Christmas and also worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't. Battery? Exchanged. But he still does not work. So the money I could have thrown directly into the trash can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush approach not to damage the needle. An improvement in the sound I could not hear out of my very high-quality record player.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Included were two black cables. The battery life is very long. Definitely perfectly adequate sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Purchase recommendation in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is well wearable for a variety of occasions.... Price-performance is fully in line here, especially since I bought it even in the lightning offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I did not order it smaller (was recommended). I would have wished only that the neckline would not be so deep, and also the sleeves could use a little more fabric (if you do not have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It doesn't get any worse than this. I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports supply enough power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD normally goes, Blu-rays are recognized unreliably at most. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes roaring noises like you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because nothing happens or the disc is finally recognized. But then you can't press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything else. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. On top of that, of course, there is no Blu-ray software included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar additionally for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there to charge any devices and is thus relatively useless. I did not know that when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a plain extension, I certainly would not have bought this bulky lump with gold plugs. But looks and my misjudgment aside, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters which I already had to send back could not do this unfortunately. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. For what I still use my PlayStation :P There was a small adapter which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my sleeve does not fit with the adapter. Well holds even so secure and has contact from therefore ... All in all, although a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, very small the whole and made in an aluminum piece stable. Price performance fits.
Lots of power
Top device. Runs for months without problems. Is not exactly light or quiet but brings decent performance. I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2. Has also fallen several times on the tile floor and has survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competitor products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the location is accurate to 0.5m felt. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, he jumps but like once a few meters which is not disturbing. Would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently, he keeps about 1.5h days through. Here would be a solution super which would create 7-14 days. There is an XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not have to hold out with us and change daily we also find impractical. You should deal with the dog not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the life span is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in sports lessons, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair it was in normal use also so that they did not last very long, but I thought for the lessons it will be enough. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs is unfortunately broken after 5 years, so I have ordered me with pleasure new. These are unfortunately poorly made at first glance. Comfortable they are just like the ones I owned before. At first glance, no difference seems to be noticeable, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the retaining strap at the heel sits quite loose and very likely will not last five years like my previous ones. I am curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was only very skeptical. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it then but times on good luck. The mattress and a car air pump were included in the delivery. About the mattress: I have test laid out in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it off and hope that it will not reappear. In the inflated state, a lie down test was carried out directly. It can lie well on it and fits super to the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace your own bed, but the for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully in my car. Previously, we took out the seats in the back. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: the air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump plugs into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the solder joint). Since my friend is handy, he was able to fix it and reassembled the good part worked great and pumped up the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very excited about the mattress. I am then curious about the endurance test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and also lasts a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not reappear. After the test I can recommend it in any case already times. If I should make other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar gets only two stars from me. :( 1. for the fast shipping. 2. for the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the läppische processing directly on day 1 over several Türchen. On 21. Türchen were no more doors on it and I had to more or less allow my son that he may accordingly take out the remaining parts because they came to him quasi already fallen. The parts often come out mixed up which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to put the parts on. After the car is completely assembled parts fall off while playing. (Mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach). In itself, I would no longer buy this calendar and also recommend no one. Maybe the manufacturers rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7 year old daughter flies with it. Indoors flies the very good and the 5 min. flight time is usually quite enough. The hair is jammed in it and the drone is broken very quickly I have not expected otherwise at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. For questions nice contact.
Game ok but only playable with forcing to Steam. Did not see when buying that it is not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine as far as it goes, but you are forced to install Steam to play it at all, which is an outrage. Since then, the computer hangs constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery runtime
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and optics great, messages etc were displayed without problems. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. Drr big hook: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, just lay on drm cabinet overnight and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. Came during the day many messages, the battery was already at noon / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time. Therefore, for me not usable. Very sad.
Noble casing with limitations
You should definitely get a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+. I have recently liked cases in which you can also insert the credit card. This is what the case here offers. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid stands a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks classy. The phone is embedded all around, unlike many other cases, there are only cutouts at the ports. Otherwise, you can operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides well through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even the leather QI charging station from TORRO does not work. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is removed. Otherwise, really chic and well made!
high quality case with bulletproof glass film
Robust case mt a real bulletproof glass to protect the screen in a classic design provides all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and fits tightly to the phone. Overall a good buy.
