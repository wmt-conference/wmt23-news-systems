Criteria for admission of children to preschool education do Kindergarten, Prague 8, U Kindergarten 8 - for the academic year 2022/2023
The actual place of residence of the enrolled applicant, in the case of foreigners - the place of residence, in the corresponding school district of the Ministry of Health, at the time of application for preschool education in the Kindergarten, Prague 8, in the School Garden 8.
Another evaluation criterion is the age of the child.
Children are admitted in stages according to the following criteria to fill the capacity of the kindergarten.
And if you can, pray for us, mentioning all the Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names"...
Letter from the occupation.
The Kherson.
Natasha, we're holding on as best we can.
You can tell that they're afraid.
They're very scared.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat over and over again that they are great, that they are strong and that we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and the head swirls... How can you be afraid if you, for your size, need someone to repeat it to you?
Like you're not sure of yourself.
It's like, sex with an impotent person, who has to be told over and over again that he's strong, that he can do it, and for a really long time, that he has to be very hard working and thinking about when this painful abuse is going to stop.
We're doing this to save all of us.
Because it's very difficult for an unarmed man to fight against a brainless man with a machine gun.
Because then, after this evil has been driven from our land, we will have to clean up the city.
Everyone we talk to right now, they all have the same words.
Word is the town smells of rot.
We probably need a lot of cleaning materials just to wash the sidewalks, the houses, and even the trees for a long time. Because everything these imbeciles touch smells rotten.
Yesterday, a woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were large.
Three healthy men stripped her naked and left her in the street, forbidding anyone to come near her to help.
For three hours she stood naked in the street and only said out loud:
Keep away from me, my brothers.
Do not put yourself in danger.
Please!
We have a lot to do with you...
Then!
And then some.
They steal.
They steal everything.
I'm finding it hard to believe that they don't steal.
We've never seen a theft on this scale.
From children's toys to a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because postcards are always posted in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We're waiting for the U.S.S.
And when they are near, the Hersons will play with filth with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they hurry.
And we will wait.
We wait.
We clench our teeth, clench our fists to the numbness in our fingers and wait.
Because we have something to wait for.
Once and for all.
And none of this filth is left.
And then we'll clean up the city.
For a long time.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And if you can, pray for us, mentioning all the Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names"...
For obvious reasons, the author is not mentioned.
I know a lot of people don't want to be with people who are sour, but still I don't give up hope.
How satisfied are you with your accommodation?
Do you need any help?
Do you work in the same job as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar questions are now reflected by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The results can help you to better understand their situation and plan the most effective treatment.
The data collection is done through an online questionnaire.
Invitations to the research will be sent to all who provided a functional email when asking for humanitarian aid (from invitation@click4survey.cz).
The questionnaire is filled in only once!
Completing the questionnaire will help to map out the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
The use of the "techniques of violence"
Mechanics of the Force.
We make electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics or modern medicine -- none of this would be possible without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues to join our production team, who want to work in a unique environment, not afraid of technology and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities to both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I want to say a few words about that.
A great desire to meet with the inhabitants to discuss important issues, but the meeting is forbidden by law, because the country is at war.
I'd appreciate the advice and any help in my quest to do as much as I can for the residents.
Together we are a force.
Together, we can overcome any adversity.
Together we will win.
So turn around.
I'll listen to everyone.
I would be immensely happy and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the terms of payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all Ukrainian refugees who arrive are entitled to a first aid payment of Ks 5,000 without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
To receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove their poor financial situation  be considered unemployed, not to have property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labour decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è The first benefit payment will no longer be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily reusable food, and sanitary facilities, he cannot claim a benefit of CHF 5,000.
The government will start to believe that basic aid was provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene), meaning that the purpose of the humanitarian assistance has been fulfilled and there is no need to pay cash.
This event is designed to solve the problem of Roma refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for financial help.
2Ô∏è The right to a cash payment of second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth aid will still be given to only those refugees who can prove immediate need (lack of employment, etc.).
However, there are two other conditions:
üìå as in the first point, assistance in the form of money will be able to receive only those Ukrainians who were not provided with free housing, daily reusable food and hygiene equipment;
üìå the applicant must actually reside in the territory of the Czech Republic.
This is needed to end the practice of "aid tourism" when a refugee lives in one country and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days purely for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about a change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address in the aid application does not match the address provided in the database of the Ministry of the Interior, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that he actually lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the allowance will be denied.
To date, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion crowns on humanitarian aid payments.
And I spent the whole day digging defence works, and the whole city is being digged, which is not a very good forecast for the near future.
To be honest, I'm tired. It's very difficult to organize that kind of process.
We are helping the army dig trenches and trenches, but it takes someone to organize the equipment and the people and I am the mayor of the village, so that's my responsibility
All utilities are involved, and we're also going to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We have to regroup, or else we won't be able to defeat the Katsaps
A lot of propaganda to discourage people and weaken the opposition.
Honestly, I haven't picked up a shovel yet tonight. I hope I don't have to.
I had the kids put girl's stickers on my phone so I wouldn't forget I was a girl
What happens if the bill passes?
Ô∏è A government committee with representatives of the Office of the President, some ministries and business associations will be formed to revise the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
Ô∏è The Commission and other executive bodies will review all permit documents for doing business in most areas by the end of the year.
And suggest which of the permits or procedures need to be removed.
Ô∏è The Cabinet in the fast-track mode will remove all unnecessary permissions and procedures.
Without any public discussion, behind the scenes!
Ô∏è It will not matter if the Cabinet's decisions contradict current laws.
The public and MPs will lose the possibility to influence the regulation of economic activities that may harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
Ô∏è Business regulation by the state will occur on the principle of one new license  minus two old ones.
Whether or not it makes any sense.
How does this affect the environment?
Ô∏è In the backstage mode, the Cabinet will be able to change any documents regarding permits or environmental procedures.
Protection of forests, wildlife, waste management, environmental impact assessment, and more would all be at risk!
Ô∏è Neither the public nor the parliamentarians will influence the process.
We don't even know how or who is changing the bylaws until the final decisions are made.
Ô∏è The only ones who will have access to information and influence are the business associations.
Bill 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
The tight deadlines for review, the opaque procedures, the lack of any decision-making criteria  it's going somewhere east, not to the EU.
So we urge environmental organizations and initiatives to support the above
They told her, "Grandma, the Russians are coming to the village; grab your cat and get in the bus.
But I refuse, for I am an old woman... Save the children and the girls, I am already here... Grandma goes down to the cellar, plucks the cucumbers, unlocks the den with mulch and a lot of cornet; there are doors... iron bars and silver locks.
And a man with chains is banging on the door.
I didn't think I was going to make it.
Seventy and a hook years old and a rod again.
Go not thou with the naked, for a curse is thee, that thou bringest the nakedness of the nakedness to us.
The cat of the ladies hisses, the windows crack.
Tanks are rattling and moving between the houses.
The Russians are coming into the village.
A dog with three heads emerges from the nest.
Good day, go to the post office and verify your identity through "check in", then upon validation, you will be given a code, and this code again you have to enter in the online registration and you are ready.
It must be a bank card registered to the person who wants to receive financial assistance is not suitable.
Well I was doing so familiar also pointed out that needed some kind of key, but when she resisted, she waited in the government there told her why she came because she was already registered.
It also indicates to her, in this application, that it needs some sort of key, but it's actually already logged without
help me and I applied online again on may 5th, but something is not fashion to understand whether to go to the government jobs or wait
It says that you'll receive the money on your credit card after your application is processed, but it says that the identity is not verified because the banking system issues a receipt
Good afternoon, my dear Angelino.
I want to express my point of view on the use of "in"/"on" in the word "Ukraine".
The use of the term has become a serious political issue in recent decades.
The current Russian war against Ukraine has been prepared for a long time and deliberately, including through information and linguistic policy.
Thank you for the interesting exercises and problems, the clear grammar explanation, and the pleasant conversation.
Special thanks for the technical support of teaching, first of all, for the tutorial that allowed us to understand what we could not otherwise learn in the class.
Those three months laid the foundation for what we know.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish the whole creative team creative success, peace and happiness!
In his productions, he popularized the world classics in Ukrainian, among them "Lolita" (V. Nabokov), "Perfume" (P. Zuskind), "Sin" of M. Kotyubinski, "The Letter of the Unknown" and "Wild" by S. Zeyga and others.
His works are difficult to understand, requiring a lot of heart and soul.
The author deliberately brings the audience to deep emotions and tears.
In his mind, tears are a cleansing, a pathway to healing for modern man.
He has a number of awards.
In 2005, he was awarded the title of "People's Artist of Ukraine", Laureate of the National Award of Ukraine named after Taras Shevchenko (2007), but most of all Mr. Mikhail appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate.
Fans of Mr. Mikhail's talent, who hope that after the war is over, they'll again hear him play the saxophone, see his unparalleled skill in transubstantiation, be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to art
Minerals of Ukraine
Minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
Therefore, their location is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
The fossil fuels extracted in our country include: coal, oil, natural gas, peat, and combustible shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully meets its own needs in hard and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing acute shortages of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that unless we have a rational economy, there can be an acute shortage of everything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissy.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, agriculture, glass, porcelain and faience, and food industry.
Peat also produces a variety of chemicals, including acetone, phenols, paraffin, feed, and yeast.
Numerous deposits of combustible slate exist in the Cherkasy and Kirovograd regions.
The geography of the location of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological terrain.
Fuel resources are sedimentary in origin and therefore enter the shafts of old and young platforms, as well as the extreme foothill faults.
The coal.
94.3% of our state's coal reserves are hard coal.
Ukrainian hard coal is distinguished by its high quality.
Because of its high carbon content, it has a high heat capacity.
Ukraine has deposits of the best grade of coal  anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of coal is coke.
After special treatment, it is used in the smelting of cast iron and steel.
By explored coal reserves, Ukraine occupies the 8th place in the world and 1st place in Europe, and by output  11th place and 3rd place, respectively.
Explored coal reserves in Ukraine are about 50 billion tons.
Estimated reserves are about 120 billion tons.
The Russians like to write "messages" on the shells they drop on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
Yes, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the stage of Eurovision to save the soldiers blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol and the next day the Russians wrote on the shells Kalush, as you asked! #naAzovstalu.
The missiles that the Russian military fired on the station in Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022, said "For children".
The shells with the cynical inscription killed 61 people, including  7 children.
The tradition of writing on shells appeared in the First World War.
During World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to the enemy.
This then helped the soldiers to maintain fighting spirit as they defended their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on the shells of Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they don't like the political course of Ukraine.
Russia must be stopped so that such "messages" do not reach any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing met us with a relatively short queue and welcoming Slovak border guards.
We're taking insulin, it needs a temperature setting. It can't heat up.
Is it possible to go through the control in fast mode?
The border guard let us stand at the front of the line, and even the wagons gave way gracefully.
Lviv
The Lion City is alive.
It's like the aorta of the Ukrainian body - the endless flow of people.
People from all parts of the country have found refuge and a sense of security here.
Some go on to Europe, some return home, some stay.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the windows of the cathedrals.
She covers monuments and sculptures with white canvases.
But the war is not heard in the Market Square, where thousands of voices are simultaneously heard, not heard in the coffeehouses or bars where people continue to live.
Yes, life ends before 11 p.m. life hides from the curfew.
But here it is: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 p.m. and we sounded the alarm, it was only heard from the alert on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living their lives.
Butch, the Irpin.
We made our way to Kiev through two of the many martyr cities - Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities where the air smells of hope.
People in pain, they come back and rebuild their lives.
It's a private house.
The park is as it should be.
(Shot or automatic lines?)
The Ukrainian flag is stretched on the shattered balcony.
By the front doors there are holes, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And there are three at this front door.
They clean, they tune up, they build a wall and with it, a new life.
And there's a mother and her baby in the park two blocks down.
I can't help but wonder: Did their dad survive the shooting of the men in Butcha?
Does he still go out with them?
On the way out of Irpen there is a cemetery of cars.
These are the same cars that the civilians tried to get out in and were shot down by the Russian occupiers.
The cemetery has already become an object of a kind of "patriotic tourism".
If you go deep and stand around the car bodies, you can smell a heavy smell.
That's probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow air, it looks like it could be cut with a knife.
And it's been weeks since the passengers died...
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds of the same bullets.
In one car there was an abandoned bicycle, and in the other a warm baby suit.
A safety pad manual is missing.
Remnants of someone's daily stories and someone's life.
As we drive on, I look around for one last look at the city, and I'm facing the same bridge where the frightened civilians were hiding.
So that's the same overturned bus, and right there on the broken tiles is the Ukrainian military nose of a child in white.
That kid in the white jumpsuit probably survived.
But is there any chance that the kid who was wearing the clothes left in one of the cars is still alive?
There's a man on a broken bridge with a camera over his shoulder.
Just sitting and looking at the chasm between Kiev and Bucheya.
He doesn't take pictures, he just looks.
Maybe he'll also imagine himself standing under a bridge, thinking, "What's this?"
Happy holidays! A man shouts to us cheerfully. Happy holidays to the city!
On May 29, the military Kiev celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
The Nicholas
Hero city, an outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A frontline town that can't be taken by the invaders.
And let us trust that they will not. The city fights and lives.
On street corners, at every other intersection, there are neatly arranged together rails and Bandera strips.
The evening Nicholas now incredibly quiet  noise, in the background of which lived the city, a poem.
No voices, no cars in the evening.
It is extremely dark at night.
Light cloaking for safety.
People live by candlelight, or rather, by cell phone lighting.
At home, we turn on the light in the kitchen -- quickly and as needed.
Grandma hung the windows with heavy blankets so that the light would not go through.
There's a hunting rifle next to my sister's crib.
"Under the 24th", says the father.
When we hear aerial alarms or explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in a frontline city, living with a constant state of anxiety is very difficult.
So when should we live?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers away from the city, shells from the Peons fly to the October district, covering Kulbakina.
He's been close to my family a few times.
It's the next block, across the street from us.
To the grandmother's neighbors, the windows were removed, the children took them to their home, a safer neighborhood.
And we're on the border of Ingle and Central Districts.
Life goes on and on.
A siren sounds in the city's central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple are sitting on a bench, whispering, chatting quietly.
A cyclist is passing by.
Meeting my dad. What are we going to do?
So... let's go have a cup of coffee?
And so we're sitting on Cathedral Street (formerly Soviet Street, by the way) in a little garden by a monument to St. Nicholas.
What else can we do?
To be honest, when the siren catches you on the street, there's often nowhere to hide, no open bomb shelters or basements around.
I'm looking at the county government building, or rather, through it.
It's not just a hole in the building, it's a hole in the heart of every Nicholas.
On the lawn near the entrance lies a huge trident once furnished by the ODA.
Now the place where the trident used to be painted is empty of "nothing".
As well as the office of the head of the ADA and a dozen offices around it.
The rocket landed safely on Kim's desk.
War takes on a very different profile when it is not in the news but beneath our feet.
Walking down the halls of the ADA, and every time I step outside I hear the crackling of glass.
There are many documents scattered on the floor.  Someone filed requests and applications, but it doesn't matter anymore.
On the table of one of the surviving cabinets is a powdered cosmetics.
There is a flower on the table.
They took her home, transplanted her alive.
Met a guard who was on duty on March 29.
He survived.
Stamped, stitched,  points to the head.  Already at work.
Only journalists can access the ODA.
We're joined by a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
The photos, the live feed, the interviews.
Officially,  36 people were killed.
This is "9/11 in the Nikolai language", "a monument to the Russian measure", comments the press attach√© of the regional head.
Nikolaev Oblast State Administration is just one of the wounds on the body of Nikolaev.
And those wounds won't heal soon.
Even if Denmark helps to rebuild the ODA, the Mykolaites will always see a terrible emptiness in it.
Russia has started a new "gas war".
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of the operation, Russia has reduced by more than a third the gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transportation system.
In April, it completely stopped gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream pipeline.
Official Berlin expects Russia to cut off gas supplies through this route as early as July.
The same blackmail Russia used in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
For Russia, gas has always been not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in building healthy economic ties.
Her priority is to recreate the Soviet Union and punish the West.
The financing of the Russian economy  is donating to World War III.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
The European countries are already accelerating their transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to rapidly diversify their gas and oil supplies.
But it takes time for the EU to become energy independent from Russian energy.
Meanwhile, the Putin regime is terrorizing Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and a lack of home heating.
European countries, particularly those dependent on Russian fuel supplies, may be experiencing a shortage.
But this crisis will spur greater conservation of natural resources and energy efficiency.
Europe gains by giving up Russian energy.
Because then Putin won't be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
The temporary discomfort is worth living with so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia is burning the crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary shells that destroy mature crops of grain and oil crops.
In this, Russia is contributing to the spread of world hunger.
As a result of Russia's war, the number of people in the world suffering from food shortages may increase by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, the Russians are stealing already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroying the agrarian infrastructure, blocking sea exports.
The destruction of the agrarian potential of Ukraine is another manifestation of the Russian military aggression.
So Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world economy.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
MIN-DIGITHER is launching an innovative format of hotline  virtual center Action.Business.
Forced migrants from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for residence, business registration, employment, and benefits.
Therefore a virtual centre is being launched by Deya Business in order to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format until the Ukrainians can return home.
How terrible it is to be afraid for every important day, and how you never know the day or the minute that might come
Hello, Hanna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician again and ask when I can come next for Darusya's vaccination?
It was supposed to be tomorrow, but I can't because I have to change the batteries in the car, it'll be done by the end of the week.
A neighbor brought the cable, and we charged it from Marina's car.
But the dashboard says you need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia is supposed to bring it from Ukraine, and here I have it replaced
I'll try to get the car started tomorrow, if it works, we'll drive on, I leave Grandma in the car and I won't turn off the engine.
If I don't, I'll write to you and you'll follow us.
I'm very uncomfortable disturbing you, distracting you from your work.
Okay, we'll go with you at 11:45 to avoid the risk.
"The war is not over, and the fates of our new neighbours are also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escaping to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the grand adventure they're going on together to get them into overloaded cars.
The stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all the adults who still don't quite understand why their parents stayed home.
Stories of children whose only memory of home is a toy that they could cling to during many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, the organizers emphasize.
At the end of each trip  return to a safe house.
But this trip is different, it's scarier.
This journey did not end even after more than eight months.
Return home is anticipated.
The theme of war is everywhere, so our walk may seem unnecessary.
On the contrary, in an atmosphere of rising antipathy and hostility in society that is inflamed and exploited by the Nationalists, we want to point out that the unconscious travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in poetic form and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
Now they are part of it".
Despite such a painful theme, the parade was made to be bright and uplifting.
To do this, craftsmen and craftswomen, along with children and adults, made costumes and masks for giant toys, sunflowers, dolls, houses, and curious glow-in-the-dark birds.
The parade ran from Kampa to V√°clavok, and at each stop, there was a huge performance, dramaturged by the Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important to me to keep the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what the Ukrainians are facing now", says the playwright. "So the structure of the performance reflects normal life that is interrupted by air attack.
The first to come to the rescue are the glowing birds, who first spread their wings over the children.
And after the recent massive missile attack, this symbol of wings protecting becomes even more relevant.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song is spreading by a column.
And all the creatures came back to life: sunflowers, and rides and toys and even houses.
Such is the symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who has helped and is helping Ukraine and the Ukrainians.
And I believe that together, we can overcome this difficult road and make our homes safe".
The wife sends her husband to the market to buy cosmetic skincare.
On the way, the man meets friends and gets drunk for three days, of course without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, she remembers the snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
He thinks he's going to tell his wife why he's been gone so long.
He rings the doorbell, drops the crumbs on the floor, his wife opens the door, he raises his hands to them and says:
Oh, here we are!
Let's go, get in there, get in there...
Our editorial team interviewed Marina, a Ukrainian refugee who worked in the field of building and construction architecture in her hometown of Nikopol.
"Now I'm trying to make a living as an artist", said the Ukrainian woman.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, worrying about your family.
Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, reveals her confusion with how she and her children are adjusting to the new circumstances.
But the woman believes in her own strength and tries to adapt to life in Prague, never leaving thoughts of returning to Ukraine.
From Nicopolis to Prague
Marina is a native of Nikopol, in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and had two children - a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect at the State Nikopol Institute.
I am an architect by education, I graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Prior to that, she studied at an art school, graduated from high school in the specialty "artist-designer", Marina said.
Everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the oppression of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina and her children left Ukraine without hesitation.
Prague became a refuge for women.
Of course, it's a new city, big, populous... new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so a lot of what the Czechs say to me I understand.
Knowing English and sign language also helped me.
Besides, I am not ashamed to ask the Czechs for help, and I have never felt any aggression from them.
"I thank them for that", shared Marina.
According to her, the people who have lived in Prague for a long time helped her with problems related to finding housing, obtaining visas and insurance, and applying for benefits.
But she has to face many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the garden
After receiving a temporary resident visa, Marina wanted to find a job.
Of course I want to find a job in a specialty.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they divorce me...", she says.
We were not allowed to go to kindergarten because there was no room.
They say they have to find adaptation groups for children, but no one really knows where they are.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She tried to help me find a place in kindergarten by calling a number of different agencies, but..., continues Marina.
I am very worried about the condition of my children, they are finding it difficult to adjust to new circumstances, they have become capricious and disobedient.
I can't say that the children bother me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to attend Czech classes without any problems.
I took my children to a Czech class once, and they played a little, and then they started to act restless.
As a normal mother, I was distracted, I was not able to study normally... If there were language courses for adults with children or with babies someone was with them during the learning...But my daughter is so attached to me", the woman sighs.
Of course, we attend various free events with the children that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which the Czech Republic is especially grateful, added Marina.
While the children are asleep, Marina is self-educated, learning Czech online because she knows that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
One day Marina was browsing vacancies online and saw an ad: In the framework of the initiative of the Association Spolek Zaedno with the support of the EC Delegation in the Czech Republic 12 stars for Ukraine we are organizing a one-day art workshop at the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We're looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.
All that is required of the participants is creative imagination...
Marina could not help but take advantage of this opportunity.
I mustered up the courage to apply.
Those who wanted to participate were invited to a meeting, where we spent the day sketching.
Before that, I was worried.
"I hadn't picked up a brush for six years", the Ukrainian woman said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings were created on a canvas of 80 x 60 cm, among which 12 paintings are works of Ukrainian artists.
The subject of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use Ukrainian themes in our works  as the basis of the palette we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
Therefore, the collection of paintings is dominated by blue-yellow colors", Marina added.
The event featured 30 candidates, of which only 12 were selected.
Marina was among them.
On 1 June an exhibition of their paintings will be held in Prague with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic.
That's life.
All your previously acquired knowledge and skills can be used to support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic", said Marina.
And now I'm trying to make a living as an artist.
Every step is a battle with your fears and yourself.
"But we have to do something", the woman said.
Marina thanks the Czechs for their hospitality and warmth but believes that the war will soon be over and she and her children will return to Ukraine.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will take a long time to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia started.
However, the Ukrainians are not waiting for better times, but have already begun to clean up their cities and villages of Russian garbage by rebuilding their infrastructure.
Kiev took the blow in the early days of the full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital and capture it in a few days.
These towns and villages have experienced active fighting, atrocities of the Russian army, and occasional occupation.
In early April, the FSA completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Alexander Khomenko has collected photos from Kyiv and the region taken immediately after the active fighting and weeks after to show how Ukrainians are rebuilding their homes and public spaces.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia began a new phase of this war  informational.
Russia is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce the support for Ukraine from the international community.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Ukrainian Armed Forces to fight the aggressor, and thus become accomplices in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report that the Ukrainian military is establishing positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure facilities.
But it was ignoring the fact that these are only sites from which the civilian population has been completely evacuated.
Do not give in to the information attacks of the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia has invaded Ukraine, invaded its territory, killed and tortured civilians, destroyed towns and villages.
The Russian Federation is guilty of war, it has no right to any action on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and to drive the enemy from the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine to stand against Russia on all fronts!
And I'm sure every person in the world has dreamed of their own perfect home at some point.
Believe it or not, I'm no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.
It would be near the beach and have a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I sure would love to live in the heart of a picturesque landscape.
My house would be a two-story cottage with a beautiful exotic garden in front of the house, and there would be lots of different flowers and fruit trees.
I'll also have a garage for my car.
I can drive to work, to the shops, or just to travel with my family, wherever our eyes take us.
My ideal home would have at least six rooms: a light and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, a study with a work area, and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will be large, comfortable beds with nightstands and chest of drawers.
The office will have a lot of interesting books in the bookcases.
The living room would become the most frequented space in the house, where the whole family could gather together, share news, or simply enjoy fun.
That's why there would be a big sofa with small pillows, a couple of chairs, a dresser, a giant TV and a long built-in fish tank.
Plus, my perfect home would have an attic where we could make a home theater or entertainment room.
Behind my house would be a pool with a couple of hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we can work out every day to stay in shape, or just play various team sports like volleyball, basketball, soccer and so on.
My ideal home would be large and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I would love to live in it.
But it's just my dream... I have to make it come true.
Hi, how many men would it have to be to know which room to make? Is she alone?
I sent the letters to your secretary.
Yeah, naturally, I ask a few of them to know where to put them.
Yeah, well, you tell me what I need to know.
To have time to clean the room.
My daughter-in-law number 6 is about to give birth and she probably needs our help. She's left alone now, so at this moment I can't leave her without support.
The food, the diapers.
It's just I'm going to bed on June 6th.
I was only released from the hospital for ten days.
I didn't have time to buy everything for the baby.
There are no beds yet, sweetheart.
so they have to know I hope I find the main do not panic because now I don't know what to do ready to go and do the search myself but they won't let me in Donetsk there now tough fighting and I do not know how to go about it searching it is hard
So the last words I heard from him was that I was a worker and well that took my sisters and brothers that they were safe
I have to hold on to the kids. That's what's holding me on. They're my hope and my support.
I have a stifled body I don't feel anything at all I don't feel a thing well, but I can walk with me
So thank you I can't go out there today other than together need to calm down and gather my thoughts a lot

How football teams from Ukraine and Russia fought in Turkey

Signature to the photo,
At Minaya Football club claim that this is a fresh photo from the last training session after the fight with the Russians.
At a meeting in the Turkish city of Antalya there was a conflict between the players of the Ukrainian football club "Minay" from the Premier League and the Russian "Shinnik".
The parties confirmed that the fight took place on the grounds of a local hotel, where both teams were accidentally settled.
Initially, the conflict that occurred on February 13 was reported by Ukrainian and Russian media.
The fight was later confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC Minay, the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
Apparently, one of them was sober and was holding on to the hotel staff, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight did take place, but on the floor where the Russians were parked, and in equal numbers.
The number of casualties on the Shinik side only confirms the fact that the Russians are still "throwing in" theirs, the statement said.
The club claims that after the clash ended, the Russians continued to fight each other, and the local police had to intervene.
"Before the start of the meeting, the main requirement of FC "Minai" to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to host the "Shinnik", the statement said.
Football journalist Roman Bebek, who was one of the first to tweet about the situation, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player defending a colleague.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but claims that the conflict was provoked by Ukrainians.
In particular, the Baza Telegram channel writes that representatives of "Minyay" approached the players of the Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians denied this.
"The numerical advantage was on their side.
A bunch of people attacked our boy.
Yaroslavs stood up for him and defended him.
We were five or six people, the Ukrainians are much more", a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"The Yaroslavl players were examined by a doctor and the injuries included a cut lip, a broken toe and a suspected broken rib", says Kommersant.
"I don't understand how Ukrainians can be in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine", - was outraged the general manager of "Shinnika" Sergei Kulakov in a comment to journalists.
Kulakov later told Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel but stressed that they were not being evicted, they decided to leave on their own.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what is the point of diabetes medicine?
7 minutes ago
Increasingly popular injections are able to help you lose up to 15 percent of your body weight, but they have many side effects.
In the UK, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy weight loss injections used by some celebrities, notably Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps manage obesity in type 2 diabetes.
It has been acknowledged by Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, both of whom have large social media audiences.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other treatments for type 2 diabetes can indeed help with weight loss.
By affecting specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, you may feel less hungry, eat more quickly, and consume fewer calories.
However, experts warn that it is not a quick fix and a miracle cure that will help you lose weight effortlessly.
The treatment is supervised by a specialist and is supplemented by diet and exercise.
Like all medicines, Wegovy can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Among the most common are nausea or stomach upset, bloating, and gas.
In addition, rapid weight loss can result in a loss of facial fat and, in some people, the falling of cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
Doctors have dubbed this effect the "Olympiak face", after another diabetes drug that is also used for weight loss.
Doctors recommend that Wegovy be taken for no more than two years.
The U.S.S.R. has regained some lost positions

The photo was taken by MARKO DJURICA Reuters
In some areas of the front, the FSU was able to regain previously lost positions and consolidate there.
This was stated by the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhny during a conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States General Mark Milli.
According to Zaluzhny, the most tense situation today in the Donetsk direction, where the Russians carry out up to 50 attacks daily.
Heavy fighting continues in the area of Vuhledar and Mar'inka, where according to Zaluzhny, the SDF are firmly on the defense.
"Despite the constant pressure of the enemy, we continue to hold control over Bahmut and are taking measures to stabilize the front line around this city", Zaluzhny reported.
In a conversation with General Milley, Zaluzhny shared his concern about Russia's use of maritime drones that pose a threat to civilian navigation in the Black Sea.
After the capture of Soledar, Russian forces continue to tighten the ring around Bakhmut.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
Russian Defense Ministry chief Sergei Shoigu said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut was "developing successfully" for his troops.
On 11 February, in a meeting of the General Staff it was reported that Russia is strengthening its grouping of troops on the Lyman and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and the night of 11/11, the Russians attacked Ukraine's critical infrastructure in several regions.
As reported in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from 6:00 p.m. on Friday and until midnight Ukrainian air defense units destroyed two dozen "Shaheds", which the Russians launched from the eastern coast of the Azov Sea.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile strike against Ukraine.
The result is destruction in the capital and many regions.

EU to increase sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
The European Union on the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine is introducing new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking on Wednesday, February 8, in a government statement to the Bundestag on the eve of the extraordinary EU summit.
Scholz pledged that the EU would support Ukraine "as long as it is necessary".
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kiev with the largest financial support.
"In the supply of arms and ammunition, we are also far ahead in continental Europe", he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized "public tenders with the slogan: tanks, submarines, planes - who will demand more?"
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda will benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Scholz: NATO should not become a party to the conflict
In addition, the German chancellor reiterated that despite all the assistance provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should not become one of the parties to a military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue to coordinate closely with partners to supply arms to Kiev.
Scholz recalled the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022 to support Ukraine in its path to European integration.
At the forthcoming extraordinary summit, the European Union countries intend to confirm their commitment to Ukraine's European path, he stressed.
Ukraine belongs to Europe and its future is in the European Union, the chancellor added.
The extraordinary summit of the European Union will take place on February 9-10 in Brussels.
One of the main topics will be Russia's war against Ukraine.
According to Reuters, the summit of EU leaders will be attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Metsola called for Kiev to be given fighter jets and long-range weapons - DW - 09.02.2023
President of the European Parliament Robert Mesola, during a session on Thursday, February 9 during which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke, called for Ukraine to be given planes and long-range weapons.
"EU member states should look swiftly, as a next step, at providing the long-range systems and fighters you need to defend the freedom that so many take for granted", she said.
According to her, the response must be proportionate to the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union", she said, addressing Zelensky.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
Zelensky, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on its way to EU membership.
"We are getting closer to the European Union.
Ukraine will become a member of the European Union.
A winning Ukraine is a winning member of the European Union", Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending against "the biggest anti-European force in the modern world".
"The Ukrainian European way of life is being destroyed by a total war.
But for what?
To destroy the European way as such after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of the 27 elements of the European way of life, the 27 countries of the European Union.
We will not allow this", stressed the President of Ukraine.
Zelensky will ask for an expedited arms shipment
Earlier, DW reported that Zelensky arrived in Brussels to obtain the support of the European Council and expedite the delivery of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As the publication recalled a source from Zelensky's advanced diplomatic team, during Zelensky's visit to the US at the end of December last year, Kyiv received "an agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support, which was voted by Congress".
"Therefore, the president of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally goes to other capitals", the interlocutor said.
The diplomat noted that, "of course, such decisions are not the business of the Euro Council, but the decision of the member states".
Zelensky is expected to voice Ukraine's need for arms at the Euro summit and meet with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member states.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine needs primarily long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia has launched a major offensive in Luhansk - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in Luhansk Oblast, according to the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatovo-Kremlin line in the west of the region increased significantly over the past week, analysts said in a report on February 8.
It also notes that the geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvorichnoye northwest of Svatovo.
The USSR is preventing the Russian Federation from making significant progress
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three major Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces are still not allowing Russian troops to make significant gains.
The ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not gained full momentum yet, as the Russian command has not yet activated parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was shifted to the Luhansk Oblast in January after the deployment in Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in the Luhansk Oblast now hold the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces are setting the terms of engagement, ending the period of the Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full involvement of these forces may lead to their final culmination on the Svatovo-Kremlin line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts", the report states.
Analysts predict that this climax could likely create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces to use for their own counter-offensive.
At the same time, in the morning briefing, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Russian Federation forces, trying to take full control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on the offensive actions in five areas: Kupyan, Liman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novo Pavlovsky districts of Kremenny, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opitny, Marinka and Vujder.

SpaceX has restricted the ability of the U.S. Air Force to control drones through Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
The advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak, on Thursday, February 9, called on US company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kiev in the war unleashed by Russia.
Thus, he reacted to information that Elon Musk's company restricted the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite internet system.
"Companies have to decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to free life and Ukraine - and then do not figure out how to damage; or they are on the side of Russia and its 'right' to kill, capture territories", wrote Podolyak on Twitter.

Starlink is not supposed to be a weapon.
The day before, SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army is actively using in countering Russian aggression, "was never intended to be used as a weapon".
"However, the Ukrainians are using it in an unpredictable way that is not part of any deal.
We know the military uses it for communication, and that's okay.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes", the director told Reuters.
In particular, commenting on the Ukrainian Armed Forces' use of Starlink to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could "limit their ability to do this".
"There are things we can do, and we have done", she added.
The company declined to specify what measures the company had taken.
SpaceX "traded" with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX gave Kiev free Starlink systems to provide the population with Internet access.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take responsibility.
At that time, it estimated the funding needed by the end of 2022 at $120 million, and for the next 12 months, at approximately $400 million.
The question of securing the funding was discussed at a political level, both in Ukraine and the US, and in the European Union, however, soon after the company's owner Musk announced that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US Department of Defense to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the relations between Berlin and Kiev against the backdrop of Russian aggression are developing "wavy" - they have "ups and downs".
Such was his position in an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel published on Thursday, February 9.
"I'm a fast person by nature.
Others act slowly, which may also be due to their bureaucracy", Zelensky noted, adding that in the conditions of war, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every moment.
Recovery from the WPP
The President of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage the "conservative attitude" of Germany changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally received support from Steinmeier, with whom I had difficulties earlier, especially - because of the so-called "Steinmeier formula", Zelensky noted.
He stressed that "good work" had been done to change the relationship.
"We have received the IRIS-T air defense system, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives", the President of Ukraine noted.
According to Zelensky, Berlin has managed to increase the rate of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to deliver three more IRIS-T systems to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate over the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kyiv has returned relations with Germany "to a difficult phase", the President of Ukraine noted.
He called the discussions "emotional and complex".
"I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is needed not by us, but by Europeans", Zelensky explained.
Categorical to fighters
After the Allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kiev with combat tanks, discussions began on the delivery of fighters, which Ukraine insists.
Scholz took a firm stand: Germany would not, under any circumstances, give up the warplanes.
Meanwhile, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kiev "as long as it is necessary".
He made similar statements after meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of European Union leaders on Thursday.

have already nominated a new prime minister. - DW - 10.02.2023
The Moldovan government along with Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilitsa resigned.
The decision was made after consultation with the country's President Maya Sandu, Gavrilitsa said on Friday, February 10.
"After a year and a half in government, it is time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, the fight against corruption and integration into the European Union", she said.
During her time, she said, the government "encountered energy blackmail".
"They thought we would surrender and act like the previous governments that betrayed the national interests, but this was not the case. We operated in a mode of continuous crisis", Gavrilitsa stressed.
She did not specify the reasons for her decision to resign, citing only the lack of "support and trust at home".
Sandu thanked the prime minister "for the enormous sacrifice and effort", also noting that Gavrilitsa led the government during a period of crisis.
"Despite unprecedented challenges, the country has been run responsibly, with great care and dedication.
We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and bankruptcy", said the President of Moldova.

According to the law, the cabinet of ministers will continue to perform its duties until the new government is sworn in.
Sandu has already proposed her security adviser, the current secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and the country's former interior minister Dorina Recana as a replacement.
His candidacy must be approved by the Parliament, where the Action and Solidarity party has a majority.
Gavrilitsa was her representative, so voting for Rechan should not be a problem, AFP notes.
Rekan has already stated that he plans to continue to pursue Moldova's membership in the European Union.
According to him, the new government's priorities will be "order and discipline, breathing new life into the economy, and peace and stability", reports Reuters.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.
The country has twice experienced a nationwide power blackout as a result of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly restricted gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to cut them off entirely.
Chishinow has called the reduction in supplies a political decision unrelated to payment issues.

In Turkey, nearly 171,000 tents were torn down in the region affected by the quake.
Officially, over a million and a half blankets were delivered to the scene.
Meanwhile in Syria, the White Helmets, a non-governmental organization which is carrying out rescue missions in rebel-held areas, are complaining of a lack of support.
On February 10, a White Helmets representative said that only two small international teams of volunteers had arrived in the region to provide aid, with no life saving equipment.
In addition, he said, there is no humanitarian aid from the UN coming to the area.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based group that reports on the rebel-held northern regions of Syria, noted that one UN aid shipment had arrived in the region before, but lacked tents for shelter and equipment for clearing debris.
Some three thousand White Helmets volunteers are involved in rescue operations in northern Syria.
According to them, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
Some 2,000 bodies have been recovered, while more than 3,300 people are believed to have died.
More than 10,000 were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
Early on February 6, a powerful earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria.
This earthquake was the most powerful in nearly a century of observations.
The last earthquake of this magnitude to hit Turkey was in 1939, when some 33,000 people were killed.
In less than 12 hours, southeastern Turkey was rocked by a second powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.5, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

The decisive round of the presidential election is taking place in Cyprus - DW - 12.02.2023
The Republic of Cyprus will hold the second and decisive round of the presidential election on Sunday, February 12.
He was joined by the country's former foreign minister Nikos Christodulides and the former permanent representative of Cyprus to the United Nations Andreas Mavroyanis.
Conservative politician Christodulidis received 32 percent of the votes in the first round, his opponent in the second round Mauroyannis, who is supported by left-wing forces, got 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling party Democratic Union (DISY) Averof Neofita.
After defeating its candidate in the first round, the DISY party could not decide who to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, AFP reports.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal suffrage.
He forms and heads the government of the country.
The winner of the current election will serve as head of state for five years and will become the eighth President of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of a coup backed by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the Turkish-occupied northern sector of the island declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Ankara.
The last negotiations on the attempted reunification of Cyprus ended without result in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots - about 560,000 people - participate in the elections.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote for them.

Energoatom has announced a new threat to the nuclear power plant - DW - 12.02.2023
The president of NAEK "Energoatom" Petro Kotin called the reduction of water by the Russians in the Kakhov reservoir a new threat to the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).
"There are many threats to the nuclear power plant.
Water depletion in the Kakhov reservoir is a new added threat", Kotin said during a briefing at a nuclear power plant on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the water level of the reservoir was at 13.8 meters at a normal level of 16 meters "so that the plant could receive power for its generators, for the turbine capacitors and for the safety systems".
"In recent days we see that the level has stabilized and slightly rises, as it reached 13.7 meters, 13.6 meters", quotes Kotin "Interfax-Ukraine".
He explained that the Russians who control the locks at the Kahovska HPP were starting to dump less water, while the floods at the top of the Dnieper increased.
The president of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions the cooling plant at the nuclear power plant is sufficiently filled and there is still enough water, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, this, he said, "will be a big problem for the nuclear power plant".
Mr. Cotine noted that the critical level would be 40 feet [12 m], the emergency level 40 feet [12.8 m], and expressed hope that the international community, with the help of the International Atomic Energy Agency, would prevent a critical situation.

Israel to step up its campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to step up its campaign against Palestinian militants in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday.
"Today the government is gathering to prepare for an even larger response to those who perpetrate terrorism", Netanyahu was quoted as saying by Reuters.
The statement followed a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
The Attack on East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian man drove into a crowd at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was released from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
The police shot the man dead at the scene, and arrested and interrogated the family members of the Palestinian.
Israeli law enforcement officers locked the doors and windows of a Palestinian family's home.
The next step after sealing may be to demolish the attacker's home, reports AP.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot dead during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired a missile towards the Israeli border on Saturday night.
The Israeli military said the missile was intercepted, dpa reports.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army carries out almost daily raids in the West Bank, leading to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of the year, 45 Palestinians have been reported killed in these or their own attacks.
In addition, Palestinian attacks in 2023 killed nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman.
According to human rights activists, some 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022, making it the deadliest year in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, 30 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the past year, according to the AP.
Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, reports dpa.

The Greek foreign minister visited Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - longtime adversaries, writes dpa on Sunday, February 12.
On the same day, the foreign ministers of the two states, Nikos Dendias and Mevlut Cavusoglu, held an unexpected meeting in which, as Greek TV cameras recorded, they even embraced.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
Cavusoglu thanked Dendias for making Greece one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the disaster.
He added that both countries will try to resume dialogue and resolve their problems.
"Greece's assistance to the Turkish people does not end there", the Greek Foreign Minister stressed.
According to him, Athens will "do everything" - bilaterally as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit the disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams are operating in the Antakya and Hatay region.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
For several days, political commentators and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope that the assistance provided by Athens to Ankara might be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members had already shown solidarity with each other during the strong earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This assistance, known as "earthquake diplomacy", helped to bring some relief.
Conflict over the Islands
Athens and Ankara have been fighting for sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean for decades.
Ankara questions Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos, and Kos.
Greece is said to be violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous amphibious ships on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
See also: Are Greece and Turkey on the verge of armed conflict?
Turkey is increasing its claims on a daily basis by flying fighter jets over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country's leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Warming of Ankara and Armenia
Amid the tragedy caused by the earthquakes, there is also a warming of Turkey's relations with Armenia.
Ankara opened a crossing that had been closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia for disaster victims have passed.
In addition, Armenia reported sending two rescue brigades to Turkey and Syria after the February 6 earthquake, which killed more than 33,000 people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are strained for historical reasons - some 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
As the rightful successor to the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits to having killed several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide has been condemned by the United States, Germany, and France, among others.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the backdrop of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation has only become complicated.

NATO is discussing further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers opened in Brussels, with a meeting in the so-called Ramstein format on Tuesday, February 14.
The event agenda is to further build support for Ukraine in the war and to increase the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the meeting that NATO must provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war".
"We see no signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensive actions and new attacks", he is quoted by Reuters.
"This is a war of attrition and therefore a battle of logistics", Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiating possible delivery of fighter jets to Ukraine.
The head of the Munich Conference opposes "red lines" in aid to Ukraine
At the meeting, ministers are expected to endorse long-term policy recommendations for Alliance defense planning.
"Allies will discuss investment in defense as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure", Interfax-Ukraine quotes Stoltenberg as saying.
What to Expect From the Ninth "Ramstein"
On this same day, the US-led Contact Group is meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, with the participation of Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.
The head of the Ukrainian defense ministry will also join a special session of the NATO defense ministers meeting.
"More than 50 countries of the Contact Group are united with you in this fight for the sovereignty and self-defense of Ukraine", Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin tweeted, posting a video of his meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership had previously expressed hope that the next meeting of the Ramstein partners could decide on the provision of Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kiev also expects that as a result of this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of the delivery of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants to ban Russian artists from touring the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine is collecting data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organisations financed from the Russian state budget, in order to include them in the new EU sanctions package.
This was reported in an interview with DW by Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Galina Grigorenko.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
According to Grigorenko, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum very clearly said that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation", Grigorenko says.
In her opinion, cultural dialogue with Russia is impossible now.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
So, recently the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a trusted person of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DNR" in the Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially stop Russian artists from touring
However, according to Grigorenko, this is not enough and those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin's policy still manage to tour Europe.
"In order to officially cancel such tours, you need to have names on European sanctions lists", Grigorenko said, and added: "We are working to ensure that Russian cultural figures who promote Russian narratives outside Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts, on EU territory".
According to Grigorenko, this issue in Ukraine is dealt with by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group at the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As reported earlier, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9 noted that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at the summit in Kyiv.
She promised that many propagandists will be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of Russian cultural and media figures, which contains more than 300 names.

The United States is ready to sell Poland HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment for 10 billion dollars
The U.S. State Department has approved a possible sale of about $10 billion worth of military equipment and services to Poland.
This was reported by Voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin, citing the Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
It is primarily about launchers of the M142 HIMARS high-mobility artillery missile system with ammunition to them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such an acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe", the Agency said in a statement.
According to a Pentagon statement, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and deter regional threats".
In general, Poland applied for such equipment:
- 18 of the M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of the HIMARS booster module;
- 45 M57 military tactical missile systems (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of the GMLRS guided missile system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
Also included are missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and staffing, system integration support, engineering and logistics services for the U.S. government and contractors, training, sensors, other related hardware and software.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is in addition to launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019 that have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw has also invited missile systems from South Korea, the newspaper reports.
NATO secretary-general called the U.S. to be prepared for a long Russian war in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine for protection in the war against the Russian Federation is not off the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
"The first step in providing advanced aircraft is having soldiers or aviators who are able to use them.
It's a process that takes some time.
We started this process today", Sunak said about the previously announced program of training Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
- Nothing is off the agenda, and our leadership in this issue is something we should all be proud of".
Sonak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks would arrive in Ukraine "next month" and stated that Ukraine "should never again be left vulnerable to attack", and also called for "weaponizing Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term".
According to him, Britain has agreed to expand its training program, which trained 10,000 troops in the past six months, and promised, as CNN reports, to "accelerate the delivery of our equipment" to ensure Ukraine reaches the front lines in the coming "days and weeks, not years".
President Zelensky during the press conference expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: "Today it is clear that we have the support of Great Britain.
Thank you to the people of Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity".
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he reiterated the call for giving Ukraine Western fighters and added that he had "heard from the Prime Minister about the desire to give fighters" to Kiev.
The Russian Embassy in London has already said that Britain's decision to provide fighter jets to Ukraine will have "military and political consequences" for the whole world.
Now, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kiev continues to talk with Western partners about the possibility of delivering fighter jets: "I have spoken with Dutch Foreign Minister Wapke Guksstra to coordinate our international steps as the full-scale Russian invasion approaches the year mark.
I thanked him for the final decision on the tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation".
Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat said in a comment to CNN that Ukraine would need dozens of Western warplanes to win the war against Russia.
But observers say that the West has little time to help Ukraine with new military hardware before the expected new Russian offensive begins in the spring or even in February.
By some estimates, the Kremlin is already trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since early January.

"Politics and Profits" in the Way of Vaccination
The director general of the World Health Organization said Sunday that if countries do not effectively use existing tools to fight the pandemic, it will not end.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it", Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the tools we need - effective health care and effective medical tools.
But the world has misused these tools", Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries around the world.
The obstacles to reaching the WHO target of vaccinating 40% of each country's population against coronavirus are "policy and profits", the WHO chief said, "not manufacturing".
"Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue to COVAX and the African Vaccine Fund", Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaborative initiative created to equitable distribution of the COVID vaccine.
Gebreyesus also stressed that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic in isolation from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperating to protect other people.
Together!" he wrote on Twitter.
The WHO official also called on vaccine manufacturers to "prioritize and execute their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African Vaccine Fund]" and to become "much more transparent about where it is going".
AVAT is an African Union initiative aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to "share know-how, technologies and licenses, and to waive intellectual property rights".
Earlier, The Washington Post contributor Karen Atiyah called on the US administration to share the "recipe" for the Moderna vaccine with the world.
"The U.S. administration has been babbling about the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country makes donations in the form of vaccines instead of knowledge, that's not benevolent philanthropy; it's superficial.
Poorer countries didn't ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they asked for a fair chance right from the start", she noted.
"We are not asking for charity", Tedros said, "we are calling for smart investment in global recovery".
As reported by Voice of America, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the abandonment of patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
This is part of the U.S. administration's plan to allow poorer countries to produce drugs that mimic patented vaccines.
It was opposed by the pharmaceutical companies, the EU, etc.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center reported on Monday that it had recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, nearly 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

Polish President Andrzej Duda has said that the decision to send F-16s to Ukraine would be a "very serious decision" that is "not easy to make".
This was stated by one of Ukraine's closest allies in an interview with CNN television against the background of discussion of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
According to CNN correspondent Laura Kunzberg in Warsaw, in an exclusive interview that will air on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16s would create a "serious problem" for Poland because the Polish air force has less than 50 planes and the Poles themselves "do not have enough...and we will need many more".
Dude also emphasized that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have "a very serious need for maintenance", so "it's not enough just to send a few planes".
These remarks by President Doda came amid talk of new arms supplies to Ukraine, including Western tanks and older anti-missile systems.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has been pressing its NATO allies to send Patriot installations and Western-made tanks such as German Leopard tanks to Kiev.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has made an unannounced European tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with a means to fight Russia from the air.
In London, President Zelensky called the combat aircraft "wings of freedom" for Ukraine.
This is the message Zelensky repeated in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelenskyy said he was "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hopes that future negotiations on providing Ukraine with aircraft would also be successful.
"I have heard from some European leaders that they are prepared to give us the weapons we need, including aircraft.
I'm having a series of bilateral talks right now, and we're going to discuss fighter jets and other aircraft.
This is why we continue our work here in Brussels", Zelensky said.
Last week, as reported by Voice of America, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his country is ready to hand over its F-16 fighters to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Gukstra said that his government would consider Kiev's request for the F-16.
Earlier this month, U.S. President Joe Biden denied the supply of F-16s from the United States, but Western experts believe that these planes could arrive in Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that earlier, weapons that the U.S. had refused to supply ended up in Ukraine if the European NATO allies agreed to hand them over.

KISHINIV, Moldova - A number of the Witnesses have become acquainted with the Bible.
On Monday, Moldova's president said Moscow is conspiring to use foreign saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country "at Russia's disposal", and derail its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maja Sandu's briefing came a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had intercepted plans by Russian secret services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.
"The plan for the next period is to involve military trained saboteurs, camouflaged as civilians, who would resort to force, attack some government buildings and even take hostages", Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The aim of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change Kishinev's legitimate government to an illegitimate one", Sandu said, "which would put our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration".
She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence into our country will not succeed".
Russian officials have not responded to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of some 2.6 million people, has sought closer ties with its Western partners.
In June last year, it received candidate status to the European Union on the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December the Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several instances of organizing criminal elements and stopped attempts of violence".
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a NATO member, has faced a number of challenges.
These include a serious energy crisis after Moscow dramatically cut off gas supply; rapid inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed its airspace and debris that was found on its territory.
The Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu stated that Russia wanted to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the intelligence obtained contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry into Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that the government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control", Sandu said.
She said the Moldovan parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the Prosecutor's Office, with "the necessary tools to more effectively address risks to the country's security".
The president added that the plan would "rely on a few internal forces, but especially criminal groups", and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilana Shora and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.
Both men were sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. last year.
Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shora party also shook Moldova amid the energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday followed the resignation of Moldova's Prime Minister Natalia Gavrillit on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defence and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorine Rechan, as Gavrillit's successor.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has for years supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova that often involve the use of corruption as a weapon to achieve their goals".

The girl liked to imagine familiar streets peaceful, quiet and greener than they had been a hundred years ago or even before.
But there is no magic that can take you back in time.
Whoa!
Say this!  The wild woman clapped her hand on the table  and the vases with the flowers quivered timidly.  I'd have sat captive for a week in my grandmother Ruthemera and her colleagues, praying at every truck stop that they would take you to any city that would.
Except you loved going day and night making bed sheets, picking weeds, hanging them under the ceiling, and singing the old hymns.
Grandma always said that without words, none of my potions would be right.
And wait, I didn't mention picking up all that junk at night!
If I did, little white girl, you'd be dead in a week!
Because of such films most people believe that women go into prostitution for a "good" life, that they like the "work", that it is their conscious choice and so on.
But if you start to really get into that, it gets scary...
The problem of Ukrainian women being involved in prostitution is particularly acute now.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea of legalizing prostitution... so I didn't treat him very well.
I think that we have to learn from Sweden, there is a kind of "Swedish model".
The order is not to the woman, but to the client.
It's about helping women get out of this "business", not making it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social security at all.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything anymore.
Men too should consider what they are buying - "pleasure" or violence....
We need another... You could look me up at the nearest optician with a doctor to make me a prescription for glasses.
And the dressing needs to be purchased, quality... I looked at some websites with dressing, I was pleasantly surprised - it is cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered the glasses two years ago, paid about $300 for them, and the fit was average (or even below).
I don't know what the stores are like, but the online prices are pretty normal.
But as for some of the cosmetics, I can tell you that these are more expensive.
That's a lot.
We have multifocal lenses in glasses that are very expensive (compared to our average salary).
Considering our family's budget (especially the fact that we have to rent accommodation), $300 for glasses is quite a sum.
Did your doctor offer you an artificial multifocal lens?
I wore soft contact lenses for 10 years, then I developed intolerance to soft contact lenses, then I wore hard contact lenses for another year, and then I developed a severe allergy to nearly every cosmetic.
For four years, I've been wearing glasses all the time, lenses very rarely.
Yeah, I also read that covid affects eyesight.
Also, reading glasses are needed after the age of 40.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses that cost over $1,000, very, very expensive.
Yeah, glasses are in style.
I asked one doctor why he didn't wear contacts or get laser correction, and he said that glasses were cool.)
For a pensioner with a pension, 1,500 UAH is an unrealistic amount
I have glasses to hide my wrinkles.
It is.
My mother has little work experience.
She worked little: first little children who often were sick, then she looked after her grandmother... then the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father earns 3800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about $9,500 (U.S.) and that had to be spent on rent.
In good times (before covid) there were premiums, but with the onset of quarantine, there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
Therefore, many Ukrainians go abroad to work to provide for their families or to buy a card, but then they lose touch with their families...
Yes, there are advantages.
But when my husband has a day off, he goes to the gym
Good afternoon.
In accordance with the order from the day of its official publication, the sea ports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until the restoration of control over the said sea ports.
It is indicated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the inability to provide services to ships and passengers, to ensure an adequate level of safety of navigation and protection of the environment during Russian military operations in these regions, which threaten the life and health of people.
The Russian Federation is using a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
According to a correspondent of Ukrinform, this is reported by Reuters, citing a statement from the British Foreign Ministry.
"The UK Foreign Office said Sunday that Russia is using a troll factory to spread misinformation on social media about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including the UK and South Africa", the report said.
It is noted that the MFA reached these conclusions on the basis of an expert study.
The ministry said the probe had exposed how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign is designed to manipulate international public opinion about the invasion of Ukraine, boost its support and attract new sympathizers.
According to the study, the troll factory "used Telegram to recruit and coordinate new supporters who later acted against Kremlin critics, throwing them comments in support of President Putin and his war".
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
"Traces of the operation were found on eight social networks, including Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok", the report said.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that her government has already "warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations".
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadow troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war", Trace concluded.
Ivanna, I'm going to explain it to you.
You have a hair structure where all the hair is practically the same length.
Very few short layers.
Or to achieve the smoothest possible result, you may need to use a hair brush.
But this will have a strong effect on the density of the hair.
That's why I didn't do it.
Or dye the roots to make the transition smoother.
I didn't paint the roots either, as you requested.
So the transition can be a little bit abrupt.
I can lay out the transition for you, but you'll have to decorate the roots.
The roots will be dyed to your color, so when the hair grows back, you won't notice the difference.
About the quality of the hair.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
The hair may dry out, which is normal, because she's blonde.
It's impossible to make a blonde like that without losing quality.
With proper care, it will return to its normal condition.
Please write down what Matrix care you use.
Maybe he's too weak for a blonde.
We can sign up for free dives to make the transition smoother.
This picture is also quite a sharp transition.
Because a high percentage of blondes are in the root zone.
Please write when you can drive up so I can take a look.
If we do the sinking, it will take about three hours.
There is a lot of good in what I do in my job.
I was helping people, and that's what I wanted to do.
But in this way, they help a people whom hardly anyone in the world helps at all, and say "good day" with a smile on their face.
I found some wonderful basic lessons in Czech on the Internet today.
I'm cleaning these rooms where the homeless sleep in the morning, but I'm alone, and the doors are locked.
I listen to these lessons with headphones and rehearse them with the lecturer.
On the side, I'm talking to myself, but it's good that nobody can see or hear me at this time üòÖ I think I can learn the language for an hour a day.
So another big plus of this work is learning language in the headphones and in the hands-on interaction with other people.
Over the last 100 years, Russia has waged 31 military campaigns.
The longest period of peace was 12 years, between the invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She assaulted 10 of them.
Most of present-day Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes that had a significant impact on the formation of the cultural background of the Russians.
The cult of conquest and incursion has thrived throughout Russian history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then  20 years of Putin's regime.
These cultural features have shaped the state institutions that cultivate the politics of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of aggression because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet felt the full effects of the economic sanctions.
Their standard of living did not deteriorate enough to trigger mass protests within the Russian Federation.
So demand stronger sanctions to get the Russians to change their country from within!
Russia is creating the threat of a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military is shelling and seizing nuclear power plants in Ukraine.
They shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
They fired from tanks and took control of the Zaporizhia NPP, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also spotted over the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant in the Mykolaiv region.
Russia's actions violate Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which forbids attacking nuclear power plants.
A rocket strike, reactor overheating or spent fuel due to power and water supply failures can lead to radiation leakage.
Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors.
Russia does not have to press the "red button" to cause a planetary disaster.
Support Ukraine  the Russian threat can only be defeated together!
The Russians are looting Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural equipment and first harvests from Ukraine.
Such cases are recorded in four regions of Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a deliberate policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory decided to "expropriate surplus crop of last and this year" from southern Ukraine.
The occupation authorities confiscate the planting materials of the farmers, but at the same time demand that they successfully carry out sowing in order to send new crops to Russia.
It prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement,  threatens with physical punishment.
Russia is repeating the USSR's policy of mass looting of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
Thus began the Holodomor in 1932-33 and private property in Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of a "war of liberation with the Nazis", Russia in particular is provoking famine in the occupied territories and destroying Ukraine as a competitor on the international food market.
Don't buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country renounce all cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine are taking children hostage.
Their mothers are forced to spy out the locations of Ukrainian military, or threatened to kill their children if they refuse.
The people are forced to make a tough choice: lose their children or become traitors to their homeland and suffer the consequences.
Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine, Lyudmila Denisova has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin has even initiated amendments to legislation to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbass.
Call on your authorities and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don't like their indecision.
Because NATO doesn't close the skies over Ukraine, thousands are dying.
More than 50,000 civilians have been killed.
However, without Western weapons, we would be powerless, but I have to say that they also arrive too late and not enough.
Nevertheless, we need to join NATO for the sake of our future.
I think it's good for the alliance, because with NATO arms and nine years of experience of war against Russia, our army is the most efficient army in Europe.
Did you know that the Ukrainians figured out how to reload the Nlaw's disposable anti-tank complex?
I think the Americans are assembling these warheads in a launch stage.
The Russians deserve the worst and the harshest thing imaginable.
So in a way, I'm happy with what's going on.
Because this war doesn't last for four months, it started somewhere in the 15th century, I don't remember exactly now.
But all these hundreds of years they've been trying to make us their slaves.
Before one generation dies, another is born and takes up the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have come back to us again.
This has happened before, but for the first time, Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a nation.
It's weird to think that the enemy was right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the speed of events, I did not even have time to contemplate, reflect on the fact that there is a war going on and what that means to me.
There's great but you have to learn the language and go to work I can not sit for maintenance of the Czech state, but the problem is that my husband does not want me to do the job, constant quarrel.and will have to go back to Ukraine and we could stay but he will do everything to ensure that we go back.
He doesn't want us to live here. That's his answer.
Well, he's glad we're here but to stay at home all the time I took the kids to school myself and swimming and I ask that we stay here after the war.
I probably can't leave on my own if he has long hours. And he'll probably deny permission to take the children to the Czech Republic.
The Long Beating
I want to learn to be a hair dresser when the war is over and then I'll tell him to take us to the Czech Republic. If he doesn't want to go then we'll probably have to go to the lawyer. It's too early to do anything.
We'll go home, but I already know that he won't take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine he said he would))) now I know the truth
Yes.thank you.we will get out of this situation, the main thing is for the war to end!!!everything will be fine.!!!
No, at present he has no one is sure.I think the reason is that children want a lot of things in the Czech ask him toys and McDonalds run down, yell, run around the house.and he is used to the calm that no one is bothered and lower does not ask.and here we arrived and everything annoys him and we need to spend money, and he is very economical. that's better for us to live in Ukraine.
Out of the train window, majorilias sprinkled with a fine grey board, birch trees and cherry trees sprinkled with black and white confetti, and anxious tankers and freight wagons.
Comrade Comrade Orlru lay on the narrow Spartan bed he was used to, for it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed in his home.
He unfolded a simple set of stale bread and butter wrapped in a grey pot.
Comrade Orlov was frugal in his food, and in his life, he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun in this simplicity, because he was only doing what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he leaned over the old, detached case and carefully with two hands pulled up the crystal dome that glowed dimly in the gray light of the center strip.
"What have you got there, comrade?" asked the young cadet, his neighbour.
"It is a rarity", said Comrade Orlov, with an unexpected delicacy, while firmly placing the skull on the merchant's table, "that's it... a very interesting and curious thing".
This, you might say, my friend...
Yeah, I'm looking at work on five sites.
But unfortunately, I find work for men, for special education.
I don't speak Czech, I'm a teacher of young children, I'm not an engineer and I don't have a driver's license.
There is also the big question of housing.
It's my first time abroad and I just don't know what to do or how to act anymore.
I haven't been able to find a job for a month, only cleaning one house.
I understand that Prague is a very difficult situation, so I'm not even going there.
Here I'm having problems everywhere üò≠ I'm a first time foreigner, I don't know the language and I'm all alone.
I and 20 other guys were fired by the agency after three weeks of work.
I can't find a job anymore.
I ask people, I look at the websites, nothing.
This is the village where I attend a course.
One lesson a week on Tuesdays
Unfortunately, the way things are going right now, I have to stick with free housing while it lasts.
And look at the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with a place to live.
I don't see any other options.
I don't want to just sit around, because housing won't be free for long.
I see.
I don't want to take money from you.
I don't want the opinions of lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a place to live in a normal city, not the capital.
The difficult trip from Ukraine of three days and the big city with a foreign language really scared me.
I didn't come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
It was to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Maybe you know someone in a small town?
I can take care of the children, cook, clean, work in the garden....
I know how to sew, I have sewing machine training.
I made custom bed linen and some clothes.
That may be the job.
I can do that!
A hug and congratulations to all!! üôèüèªü§óü§óü§ó
It's so good to read you!
We have an air alarm again.
Today more than 100 missiles landed in Ukraine
I was working with the wounded today, and it was hard to concentrate.
All my thoughts were with the child.
Jan was home schooled...
Everything will be Ukraine!
We're serving this evil!
In the surgical ward, my colleagues and I volunteer
Sometimes it covers up, of course.
Then I clean, cook, and talk.
Because this is my home, my land!
Give my regards to everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love!üôèüèªü§ó
Thank you for your letter, and I express my personal opinion, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the question of whether or not to expel the Association of Russian Psychologists from European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But I believe that the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is paramount.
Let me give you an analogy.
In a sandbox, if one child steals a toy from another, the adult with responsibility will try to reconcile the children, and the play continues for a while.
If a child in a sand pit starts punching another child in the face with a shovel, that child will be isolated for a long time, and no one will play with it.
I also liked the analogy of one Russian colleague who's a psychologist, and she said that when a neighbor kills someone, they don't put the whole apartment building in prison.
There is a lot of discussion among Ukrainian psychologists on the exclusion of Russian associations from European ones, many feel how painful that can not stand to communicate with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sorrow about the war in Ukraine, but I'm willing to continue collaborating with a number of Russian psychologists that I know and share knowledge in order to treat the injuries of clients on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists, and I have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of the Russian troops on Ukraine, and who at their level are trying to do a lot of things to promote common human values in Russia.
So I definitely support a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia, 5-10% of the population support the war, and the rest of the numbers in the polls are dictated by propaganda.
My wife left her native Ukraine because of the war there.
My wife had a good job and, no matter what the war, she never left home.
In order not to sit on our back in the Czech Republic, my wife is trying to earn money, since in 2009 she received a diploma in Ukraine as a masseuse.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money any way he can.
Now the only problem is to learn the Czech language.
My wife studies and works and earns money for herself and the baby to buy food, kindergarten, bus fare, mobile phone services, and clothes.
In the meantime, I'm defending my country.
Thank you for supporting people who understand this.
Thanks to the Czech Republic for giving shelter to Ukrainian women and children in a difficult time. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I want to thank you for the opportunity to advertise my wife's massage services in your community.
The wife earns the money herself because she doesn't want to live on the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It really helps my wife to earn money for her family.
Okay, I'll tell my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of the Ukrainian people.
Some people laugh at my wife's ad, but my wife offers her services.
My wife was a nurse in Ukraine, and I was a police officer, but the war broke us apart.
It's good that my wife wants to work and earn money and not expect help from your republic.
WATCH!!!
The auction is announced!!!
Good evening my brothers and sisters.
Thanks to all of you, we have succeeded in ordering a thermometer, which I will receive in a few days and will hand over to our lawyers personally (I will definitely check in) ‚òùÔ∏è
However, as I said, there will be new goals and plans to continue providing assistance to our heroes!üí™
Sad and painful, but the war continues, and our liberators need a lot of tourniquets, kneecaps, military helmets, and field beds fold out (some soldiers sleep barefoot on cold ground) üòî
So, the auction is on!
The icon of the "Holy Family", handmade, special thanks for the wonderful work and caring shown by Marina Cibulice!ü•∞

Supervision of pupils during lessons, breaks, and school activities is provided by school staff.
Safety in the gym, playground, and in the classroom
Distance learning rules
If this is not possible due to the imposition of an emergency or quarantine
a personal attendance at the school, the school provides distance learning to interested students.
If a distance learning method is ordered in a school (classroom), students are obliged to do so.
The Most Important Safety Rules
In particular, it is prohibited to bring items that threaten the health and safety into school and school events
weapons (including knives), drugs (narcotics), cigarettes and alcohol.
No smoking and use of alcohol or other drugs are permitted at school and at school events.
I really need someone who can be an interpreter for the Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, as we were driving to Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian national.
So now we're dealing with the insurance company to fix the car.
The insurance company has invited a person to translate from Czech into Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa during the car's technical inspection.
Can you help me with the translator?
In particular, I have experience writing a small scientific paper based on statistical analysis of the body parameters of lizards of different ages and genders in a single population.
Additionally, I also have experience in fields close to my field of expertise.
In 2020-2021, I participated in the research of the Kharkiv Rehabilitation Center for Cossacks as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped monitor the population of storks of the Kharkov region, as well as organizing a wintering of the storks that were cared for by people in the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide in the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation that is important to me.
In Ukraine, I also had the opportunity to study research on the silkworms, to observe their behavior under a microscope, and to meet scientists who study the species.
So the possibility of taking a deeper look into these and other microscopic organisms also interests me.
How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed and why the EU is not paying for refugees  Expert's analysis
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU  is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milo≈° Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.
It has provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
About 500,000 arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support of their neighbors  Poland and the Czech Republic  and will be thankful tirelessly!
As Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, ProUkraina asked Yaroslav Kotha  coordinator and translator of the Refugee Center in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analysis, which has representation not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland Helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this had a significant impact on the life of Czechs.
There are long lines at the Labour Governments, substantial price increases in the shops.
What is happening in Poland, where millions of Ukrainian refugees are?
The Polish government was exceptionally quick to organize and provide aid when hostilities broke out.
It was predicted.
In Poland, they've said over the last few months that this is going to be a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, there was less preparation for what would happen, and in Poland, there was a lot of preparation.
For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the war, there were already plans to place refugees from Ukraine.
In Ukraine, they didn't even think that this could happen.
I heard them laughing about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very sensible to prepare before the war started for all these events.
I will note that an extraordinary amount of money has been allocated from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing from bombing by the Russian aggressor.
First of all, help with the logistics of  moving through the territory of Poland.
From Ukraine to Poland there are special trains, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.
It includes planes flying through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I had experience of working with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Luzhkov, not a millionaire as one might think.
Transport remains an important issue.
In Poland, the toll for Ukrainians has been removed.
They can travel free on trains and public transport.
In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers, who arranged free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
This means that refugees have free access to the places where they plan to stay.
The second issue is the housing of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
Most are indoor school small stadiums, complexes that accommodate temporary halls with beds.
There's free food, free medical first aid.
Refugees are given an opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and on the spot they are given opportunities to move to something more comfortable.
The large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw, where now whole Ukrainian quarters have been created, became very active.
The case of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they managed to get from the Russian Embassy objects that were abandoned by the inhabitants of this embassy.
Large housing complexes had been abandoned for decades, but the Russians wouldn't let anyone in.
The local Polish government nationalized it, so to speak.
For the benefit of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200 to 300 families at a time.
There'll be water, electricity, they'll be insulated.
Ukrainian refugees could be living there in a week or two.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step  The Sejm adopted and the Senate approved the law on the refugees from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is compulsory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medical assistance to the Ukrainians.
All you have to do is text, get the code on your phone.
And the 5 thousand hryvnia to get free medicine in Poland.
Social assistance  is three hundred zlotys, which is given irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine regardless of age.
Various foundations are widespread, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which donate packages of food, chemicals, clothing.
As the Poles would say: "Niespotykana skala".
This is an "unprecedented event".
There's a huge openness.
This is a huge expense for the Polish state.
To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
The language problem.
The questions begin in the medical clinics, where Ukrainians cannot help themselves without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems, diseases.
The second problem is school, where students, especially in the upper grades, don't really get along at first either. They can't understand the terminology.
I noticed that Ukrainian children often come with a much higher level of knowledge than their respective classes.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
And the students not only have good knowledge of English, but they also have a higher level than the class they're in.
That's interesting too.
So the Ukrainian education system is good.
And actually, kids do study well in Ukraine, if they are valued so highly.
Of course, language is important in employment.
Unfortunately, an employee that worked as a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer in Ukraine is much more difficult to master here.
A lawyer or an accountant, I don't know any of those cases.
Doctors are now appearing in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
It is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors are able to accept the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.
The language problem is often the reason why families return home after a few weeks here.
There are many such cases.
In the last few weeks, we've had a whole wave of refugees, who fled during the first few weeks of the war, now they're going back.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there is no such active military action.
They didn't fit in, they couldn't get a job.
Where they live, conditions do not meet their needs and accordingly, it's more convenient for them to return home.
This also is one of the problems that has arisen in the last few weeks.
How Attitudes to Ukrainians Have Changed
According to the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, there has been a significant change.
If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians to be exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the steadfastness of Ukrainians defending their country.
How do Poles feel about the millions of Ukrainian refugees?
Poland has a similar situation.
Here, all television channels often quote the words of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When the events of the Russian attack on Georgia, together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.
There, he made a seminal statement that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then it could be Ukraine.
Then there might be the Baltic countries, it might even go to Poland.
I mean, if he could have seen it coming.
In fact, Ukrainians today are defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, helping so selflessly with Ukrainian refugees.
The threat in Poland is seen.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases, there is a certain fear that war might also come knocking on our door.
So the attitude has changed for the better.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem is now in Poland not "a song of nationalists" or some enemies.
Of course, there are small groups of the population that have not changed their opinions, they are in every country.
But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think about Ukrainians very differently than they used to.
The claim about Ukrainian nationalists is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
This is simply laughed at in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people with no political overtone.
And this must have been quite striking, because this direct contact was influential on changing the public opinion of those sections of society that were still undecided in some of their historical questions.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
When the Poles begin to think that there can be a war, they immediately begin to realize that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as is happening now in Ukraine.
They keep talking about people from Mariupol, Butch and other Ukrainian cities.
Poland's Response to the Russian Threat
Ukraine is confident of victory, but is preparing for the worst because a terrible war is going on.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are taking their own security seriously.
Russia is afraid that it will use nuclear weapons in retaliation for its support for Ukraine.
How is the Polish government and society reacting?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
In fact, Poland does this, it has very good relations with the United States, with other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
There is an additional recruitment of the territorial defense forces in Poland.
So this is how preparation for all sorts of war scenarios take place.
Citizens sense that the government is preparing for such events.
Among these, the recently passed new law on the defense of the motherland, where the budget has been significantly increased for Poland's military needs.
Changed recruitment requirements, a lot of things that are actually related to the potential military threat.
I know you as a specialist in analyzing the future.
Your predictions came true in Syria, you warned of a Russian attack.
What about the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for the nuclear strike, I'm not so sure.
But there is a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more visible to NATO countries, and to Poland as well.
It could be, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.
I mean, I don't like this, but this is the worst-case scenario.
A small strike, but I want all TV channels to show this mushroom.
To be seen from Poland, the Baltic States.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be a desertion and a loss of combat capability of the NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian forces, the problems with Putin's entourage, oligarchs who are now very suffering from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.
We do have the facts of the fires on Sakhalin, some evidence that people are starting to resent prices.
Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.
We also have a tendency to settle wars peacefully.
Various EU countries, especially Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop substantial military aggression in Ukraine because of their need for Russian energy resources.
At most, this will last until the end of the year.
How to Live Without Russian Gas
The Czech Republic is discussing a possible gas supply cut.
This will be a very significant blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect the Polish citizens?
As an analyst, I predicted that.
I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.
My family will not suffer the loss of this resource.
But there are a very large number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the price increases.
The citizens won't feel it for the first few months, but all the prices of all the resources will start to go up definitely.
They're now searching for different routes to certain alternative sources.
Besides, we already have companies that ship liquefied gas to Poland, there's a very large port in Poland.
As for oil, we have the bright side that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually working with Putin.
Now they're going to buy the gas stations in Poland, actually by Hungarian companies that will exploit the Russian oil.
Those are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international issues.
If Europe were to abandon Russian energy carriers, it would be a loss of the source of Russia's military funding.
Even a school kid understands that without selling oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the ability to exist and will go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish media
Volodymyr Zelensky gave an interview to the Polish media.
What does the Polish media say about it?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has gone up very much.
And this growth is estimated to be unprecedented.
Vladimir Zelensky thanks for the help, talks about the real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in a war zone.
So the president's actions are judged by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.
They indicate that the Ukrainian authorities are very keen to get military and financial aid in order to secure the refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discusses these topics in a very positive context towards the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity that sometimes happens in Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.
You can't hear it here.
And I think that's very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, resilience, the ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.
It does not fade or fall off.
This is the most important thing, so there's no image loss.
Actually, the image of Ukraine is preserved, and this is very important.
Good morning to you.
Sorry to bother you again with my problems.
I'm very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
They tried to come up with something yesterday, but it was a waste.
My mother-in-law's girlfriend, who helped find the apartment, also joined the conflict.
She said that she wasn't looking for us, and that if something wasn't going right with us, we should move, and that she would make sure that her mother-in-law, not us, stayed here to live.
Unfortunately, none of them think of the kid, who is used to this place, considers it home, and in three months he has already moved six times.
I'm so sorry. I had no idea this would happen.
Again, I'm sorry to trouble you.
And with the bed, the situation looks strange.
My husband and I discussed this matter before I wrote you saying that the bed is not necessary.
He came here to see me and the baby and he really wants to go to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law herself decided that he would sleep with her in the room and spit what she wanted at his opinion and desire.
I am ashamed of you, your husband, Sharka and Jan, the landlady.
You've worked so hard for us.
I got it.
I thought it was going on for some extended period.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andrew's treatment to do this at least until the end of the summer?
Maybe you need proof for Andrew that he's sick.
In Ukraine, that diagnosis would be considered a disability.
And since Inna doesn't go to kindergarten yet, I also don't have the chance to go out to work, at least outside the house.
I understand, then it would be good to go with you tomorrow.
I'll make a bar code for myself and Andrew.
I'm worried that the humanitarian aid to him will be cut off and the treatment and rehabilitation will take a long time.
Do you have any advice?
I also wanted to ask, did you get the money for the medication you were buying for Andrew?
The grip is falling off.
It is short, so you have to be very careful not to lose it.
Only two were sold today.
We're out of apricots.
I poured some mangoes.
Mango is not very good.
Most wanted apricots.
Now they take more vanilla because they don't like mangoes.
Norm, the mango is gone.
But it started to whistle again
Actively started taking ice cream and he's not doing wellüò≠
Tomorrow will be the black currant.
Today we will definitely run out of mango and black tar.
I'm scared all the time
He freezes again, squeaks.
Hades is at 4.0.
Once active people take it doesn't release the ice cream at all.
I know.
It's just that it's their turn for ice cream, it starts to make these shades and people move on.
It's freezing out.
If one ice cream is missing, it will squeak and rub its piston.
And you can't put the vanilla in the mango.
Can Magdalena come by tomorrow at 8:00?
We need to wash the ice cream.
Today we run out of ice cream, and tomorrow it tastes different.
You'll be home tonight so we can settle up for the last month.
I'd be grateful if you could come on a Sunday or Saturday.

Leonid Kravchuk first President of the independent Ukraine
I believe it was a dictatorship because people just came out of Russia and still couldn't quite understand they like to be an independent country or they want to be an autonomous republic of Russia
When Ukraine became independent there was Kiev. But when it was part of the Soviet Union, there was Kharkiv from 1912 to 1934.
I can't say that there were any more interesting events but if at first there was democracy it would have been much better and probably now we were in the European Union
