Diego Cocca is the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. Until a few days ago, the 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post. He only took over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach sparked trouble at the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs are intended to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The campaign "Geesthacht is blooming" also includes information about what is blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is a campaign by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted since 2015. Goal: In the Geesthacht urban area, flowering islands are to be created on which insects can find food at all times. "If the weather is good, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He has his own beehives on the property.
So that the undertaking does not just remain an action by nature conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also extends widely into private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed next to the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. In this way, passers-by should be able to find out what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will specifically replant at home.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started
Shrubs such as winter honeysuckle and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone are more recent. They have been in the pots on Bergedorer Strasse for a year now, are just showing the first tender blossoms in white and pink and have recently been given additional signs. "The winter scented hedge cherry is a very broad-bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," can be read there under further information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not just the bedding plants that are showing flowers. In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started. It blooms particularly profusely on the Richtweg uphill, on Gutenbergstrasse, Wilhelm-Holert-Strasse, Fahrendofer Weg and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
Munich – dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of her when he looks down from the sky at Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m. sharp for a lively tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) from the "Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap tapping is my life, I can't imagine without it".
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today one would say musical actress, worked together with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I've spent my life dancing, acting and singing".
At 79, Elfriede Widmann is something of a chick in the group of tap dancers. She says: "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced when dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the heart and soul of the Ostbahnhof dance studio. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, big and small, old and young are welcome with us".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, eat healthy and don't drink alcohol".
Analogue in dialogue - The limits of the digital
As digitization progresses, some people's desire for analog is growing again
The speed with which our everyday life became digital gave us hardly any time to set up rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to them, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you belonged to the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a phone booth. Unforgettable the smell of the plastic handset and the click of the small change coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has commissioned former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old business expert now has 14 days to do this. Previously, Recean was one of the President's advisors.
Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned after only a year and a half in office. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was hostile to pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is Ukraine's neighbor and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, the pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023 there will be a proper celebration in Veitshöchheim. Season 5 is in full swing and the celebrities didn't need to be asked twice.
Country father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder in Bavaria. At his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Environment and Consumer Protection Minister, Thorsten Faithr, chose the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely aloof: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn to space.
State President Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace and love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder aka Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Minister of Finance Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff at carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side his wife Gerswid.
On the roll: Economics Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the craft with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, District Administrator of the district of Regensburg, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missing either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-boss Ludwig Hartmann as a Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD faction leader's desire: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It became royal with FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise he will certainly speak more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime. At his side Mrs. Andrea.
If politics doesn't work anymore, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermine.
On the move as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small dig at the climate activists by Franconian crime scene inspector Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the mayor of Veitshöchheim could not be missing either. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is catching up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even the sometimes heavy fog did not prevent the long-term winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay was enough to successfully defend the title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the chase race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, allowing him to make up for mistakes in shooting with frightening ease to a certain extent.
At Doll, meanwhile, nothing went together again. After the veteran lost all chances of a medal with a penalty loop in the mixed relay and only finished sixth, things didn't go any better three days later. Three penalties in prone and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest of the German team, who celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago he surprisingly won in Hochfilzen with a lead of 0.7 seconds before Bö. It was one of just three career successes Dolls has had on the podium this winter. The Olympic eighth in Beijing left without a word after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden welcomes Lula: "We have to stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is all about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
During a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden insisted on preserving democratic values.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years".
Left-wing politician Lula prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump broke into Parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much attention to international relations. "His world started and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and night," Lula said. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Quick note to the press - Friday
Anyone remember the RAF wanted posters? On it you could see the members of the Red Army Faction who had been released for denunciation and shooting down.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public sentiment was raised against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more after Raudis in the S-Bahn or masturbators in the park, is giving a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is badly informed, because in this world, which includes Asia, Africa and Latin America, there are perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, it's: Ms. Wagenknecht is in 1st to 5th place (!), followed by Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who reads this sheet. If so, now is the time. We have reached the known level, where nothing is below.
And by now, good dialectic, Frau Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all people who are not yet completely stupid, ie peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no further differentiation is necessary.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have split up. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. There it says: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for the dissolution of his civil partnership through his family lawyer with the competent court. I will not comment on the details".
Glööckler and his partner Schroth have been together for 35 years, and there have been rumors of separation for about a year. After participating in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have moved to Berlin from the common house in the Palatinate, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacres in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
A memorial center was set up in 1999 in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, the ruins of which remain. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the national order of merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended France's values, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had campaigned for German-French youth encounters.
A curve for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ series Nordlippische Weiler: It is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof in Homeien. Here the residents find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorbikes roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup every day - and some of them straight back again.
Deutsche Bank boss Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes to be "absolutely" necessary in the fight against high inflation. "The inflationary risks are still great. Energy costs can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag".
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and announced a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the March 16 meeting. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher interest rates on loans can lead to investments being postponed and thus economic growth being weaker.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are far more serious than higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course we have to keep an eye on that, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area in the medium term with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. Although inflation slowed again in January, consumer prices in the currency area, which now has 20 countries, were 8.5 percent above the level of the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharp increases in energy prices, which are a key driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation stays high, private consumption will "slump sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the greatest danger for the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch boss Stefan Hartung is hoping for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) for infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue about it, and it may also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end there will be a set of rules that does not necessarily have to go as quickly as with the LNG terminals that went into operation around the turn of the year - but not as slowly as before.
After ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened in mid-December. The aim was to close the gap in the gas supply due to a lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new “Germany pace” on the occasion. In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of the approval process for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it's very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters most. But that shouldn't automatically mean that from now on we'll always act categorically and put a wind turbine in the garden of our neighbors against their will." said Harting. There must therefore still be a negotiation process as to what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, the classic set of rules was tried and failed. "We should think again about whether the previous procedure was really correct. Maybe we overdid it with the set of rules and made it too complicated for us".
In view of the many open tasks, such as the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible".
Union warns of breaking up the Bayer group
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the group after an announced change of boss at Bayer. "From the employee's point of view, Bayer is in the right position with its three pillars for the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, member of the board of the union and Bayer supervisory board, of the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health area with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism".
The background is the change of head of the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The ex-pharmaceutical boss of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been criticized for a long time. The 2018 takeover of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars depends on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes into the house about alleged cancer risks from the weed killer glyphosate. Bayer stock has been falling for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the annual general meeting.
It has long been known that Baumann is not looking to extend his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had exerted the pressure. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for the group to be split up.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for aggressive action. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post". On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
The French want to take to the streets again on Saturday against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions countered a government plan with massed protests on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
Hundreds of thousands of people are again expected across the country on Saturday in France who want to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, more than a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. A turbulent debate has been going on in parliament for a week about the controversial reform.
Many people in France are already working beyond the age of 62 if they have not paid long enough to earn a full pension when they reach retirement age. In many strenuous occupations, people could hardly work longer, say opponents of the reform. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not completely wear out their health on the job.
Macron: Looming pension fund deficit
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, the employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics question the government's calculations and say the state must find other sources of funding to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government doesn't just want to tighten the retirement age. The increase in the necessary payment period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1,200 euros.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, even then there were massive protests and strikes. A number of presidents before Macron had tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were certain.
With Macron's camp no longer enjoying an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push the reform through with the help of conservative Républicains, who have announced support. But some of the MPs - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And Macron's fear of crippling strikes is likely to be even greater than the fear of a tight vote at the moment. Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the President said he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers to ensure that they passed calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun at high altitudes
A powerful high pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does that mean plenty of sunshine to be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
Calm high-pressure weather is expected in Germany at least until the middle of the week. "When you look at the weather maps, you immediately see a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe," explains meteorologist Markus Ubel from the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "Although this high will shift a little to the east over the next week, it will continue to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Ubel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands days of dreary foggy grayness, while there is pure sun in the highlands of the low mountain ranges".
Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it can also rain a little from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially at the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens over the course of the day and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country it will remain cloudy or overcast like high fog. The temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually getting stronger, nibbles at the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more over the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere it has to fight its way through the high fog. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, around 11 degrees are expected on the Lower Rhine, while only 3 degrees are expected in the permanent gray in the south-east. In addition, there is a weak wind blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday in some lowlands there may again only be a sluggish dissipation of fog or high fog. Otherwise the weather will be clear after the fog has cleared. According to the forecasts, the sun will shine all day at high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps. Depending on the sunshine, the temperatures climb to between 5 and 11 degrees.
Dominator quarrels: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
The defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia was very disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Meribel
"I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can," said the Italian on ZDF after merging a goal and being eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent what could have been a serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races of the season in this discipline. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, will have to wait a little longer for a World Championship medal in her flagship discipline. She missed her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprising victory of Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's life". Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal that all experts expected and ultimately missed: "But they aren't."
Missing girl in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on Friday. The police are asking for information on their whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the population for help in finding a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the premises of her school at around 12.30 p.m. on February 10, 2023 together with other children in the direction of the S-Bahn station Waidmannslust. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of the German language and local area.

Zelenskyy and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kyiv. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
At a joint conference call, they agreed to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of Great Britain. British Sport Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter that it was a very productive meeting. "And I have made Britain's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now issue a joint statement on the matter."
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking officials. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelenskyy. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, even a neutral flag is ultimately soaked in blood and cannot be carried.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelenskyj called on the officials to work to protect the Olympic principles and to prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to the competitions. The President also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which "unfortunately has lost its honesty".
The reason for the conference was the IOC's announcement that it wanted to enable athletes from Russia and Belarus to take part in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it would reject the start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to have the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to resume the Russian and Belarusian athletes Athletes is the wrong way," said a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior when asked by dpa.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for athletes from both countries to return to the international sports stage under neutral flags, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently declared that an exclusion “because of a passport or place of birth” violates the ban on discrimination.
Chalk it up where it happens
"Hey, hot butt!", whistling at the fool in a tight, sexy costume and shouting suggestive remarks: all of this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind the term hides nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public space.
Half of the vehicles lost? : USA see Moscow's armored stock severely depleted
Half of the vehicles lost? The US sees Moscow's tank inventory severely depleted
The Pentagon understands that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the war began. We are talking about "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its main battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the Russian army's main stock of tanks" was "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary for international security affairs at the US Department of Defense.
At an online event held by the think tank Center for a New American Security, Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks confiscated and destroyed according to US estimates.
Ukraine is set to receive main battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kiev delivery of Challenger 2 main battle tanks in March. In a coalition with other countries, Germany plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The US has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, your delivery will most likely take much longer.
Russia wants to catch up
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised to build and modernize thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging for planes, missiles and tanks abroad," said Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment, including modern tanks."
A law has been in force in Russia since last summer that enables the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army. This means that individual sectors can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Eddy about occupation of posts in the army
Because the post that the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the approach.
According to the minister, an advertisement is not necessary because the appointment is being made to a previously vacant position. She did not want to comment on "speculations by a liberal staff representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these have been eliminated.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current security policy issues.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The "appearance of Postenschacher" is responsible for the decision, says SPÖ military spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos urge Tanner to rescind the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in a swamp of corruption," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools kneel at the expense
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kissling. The funds for this alone made up about half of the calculated total costs for the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The "Train of Happy People" in Cottbus, probably East Germany's largest again, is taking place for the first time since the pandemic. No parades were canceled at the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We're going through with our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claussen. But here, too, financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors are not found or the previous ones contribute even more, reserves would have to be tapped - "that doesn't work every year". The current deficit: around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: Some confectionery prices have increased by up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Fastnachtszug support association. Due to luck in disguise, too many were ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that the move will be more expensive. Twice as many staff are needed for security than in 2020.
Those who stand by the wayside on the Rose Monday parade in the Rhineland could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train passengers don't have as much with them. Camels or not, the rush of visitors is likely to be large: "I think that if it doesn't rain cats and dogs that day, then we can definitely expect an increased rush of people," says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Shrove Monday procession for two years. Of course, there is no substitute for the procession."
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on the costs in detail. The train is generally "deficit", that's no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
It's not for nothing that the Ukrainians are hard-drinking. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't tell a big difference in taste. The same applies to the vodka, which is widely available. Here they burn it mainly in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that as a tourist you should be careful with it. But that's only true if it goes into mass sale. Then there will probably also be a mess.
FC Hansa Rostock rewarded for great effort: "Match luck on our side"
to eat and drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer after work, you will find great places in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glow for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favorites win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke".
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the awarding of medals in the Oberhof World Cup sprint. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the VIP stand on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to get the results on my cell phone," admitted Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a grin, referring to the wafts of fog that kept drifting into the stadium, which severely impaired the view of the Rennsteig for spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed visiting the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Fascinated since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race me the biathlon", he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say that - with thanks to those who have lent a hand here since the World Cup was awarded". When it comes to sustainability, the location is now "a step ahead of many others" and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades".
In terms of sport, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again surpassed the competition. Despite a penalty loop after a shooting error, he secured his sixth win in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and with it his second world title in Oberhof. Behind him, his clean-shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty loop/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth as the best German after one miss and a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished 12th (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed game on Wednesday, the Black Forester missed five targets this time and disappeared into the dressing room in 55th place, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö started the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility. However: With his last two standing shots he had the luck of the capable; they landed on the edges of the disks and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will continue to dominate Sunday's pursuit. For women, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "If you start with number one, the goal is not to come in tenth. There's only full throttle and attack to defend number one," sporting director Felix Bitterling said about his "locomotive". The organizers are expecting an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 p.m. and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on dropped ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
The top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in cooperation on the pitch. "I do think that there are new behaviors on the part of the players who surround the referee like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old of the German Press Agency. "We discussed that during the winter break. We decided that we don't want to accept such unsportsmanlike behavior. We'll pay more attention to that again - and will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches had also been sent off. Mainz coach Bo Svensson saw the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow and red. "Coaching behavior also falls under the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. We noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has increased in this area as well, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanlike conduct," said Brych.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out that the coaches and referees worked well together. "Overall, the relationship is right. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned then has to live with that. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," said Fröhlich of the German Press Agency.
"Conflicts can certainly arise from emotionality during the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into personal disparagement, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In the most recent cases, those involved would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a general rethinking process were to start that such behavior is simply not appropriate," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have reacted consistently to negative behavior," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected is always helpful."
Combined Oftebro WINS in Schonach
After a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country race, the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro secured victory ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined athletes are not at their best in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are training in Oberstdorf to prepare for the World Championships, which will take place from February 21st to March 5th in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after a rear-end collision on the A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar district), including two children. According to a police report, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed it onto two other cars. The complete closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage in the Marl Sculpture Museum
They brought the exhibition to life: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
An unusual exhibition ends on Sunday, February 12th in the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage of the exhibition "Wall-bound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transition quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Strasse 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format murals each attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over and the works of art disappear. However, a catalog documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-mounted art in the service of the community. Using numerous examples, she presents the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connections to this art genre in the Federal Republic with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia from the 1950s to 1970s.
dr Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and did her doctorate in 2013 on mural painting in the Weimar Republic. Since then she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in architecture in NRW. After the lecture, the last curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It's about construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after buildings collapsed during the earthquake. Arrest warrants had been issued for 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have favored the collapse of the building.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the suspects was reportedly arrested at Istanbul Airport. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
A 7.7 magnitude tremor shook the Turkish-Syrian border area early Monday morning, followed by another 7.6 magnitude tremor at noon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Group leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left Party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night, "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," said the left-wing faction in the Bundestag on Saturday. The party is losing "an important personality," said parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch and former parliamentary group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the GDR Council of Ministers - for around 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until reunification by the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Up until old age he was an important adviser in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful process of establishing German unity was a special achievement of his. That will remain his political legacy," wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary. It goes on to say:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated".
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "quite critically". German unity was accomplished too quickly, the GDR collapsed too unconditionally, and it was condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
what happened in the night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
KIEV - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's power grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants had been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The power supply in the Kharkiv region looks particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor unit at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production was throttled at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Russian attack with about 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terrorism. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger of Russian rocket attacks continued into Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, the air alarm was triggered for the fifth time late on Friday evening. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," said the military administration of the Kiev region. Iranian-made combat drones were also sighted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, from the election campaign to split them off failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, the compromise of an infrastructure company was agreed, which, however, should in future be oriented towards the common good. This means that it does not need to generate or pay off any profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are intended to help the federal government to accompany this process. The renovation backlog in the rail network is a major reason why the train is currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem by completely overhauling entire railway corridors. The investments that are necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to more recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof 2023 – gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: “Can someone please pinch me?”
The external circumstances apparently did not speak for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept badly, she said after the race, was "totally excited" and her pulse hadn't slowed down as soon as she walked in. "Such a race", and that at the home World Cup, "you can't describe it in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, supervisors and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy the biathlon", that's what she had planned
The pressure was particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old started as the biggest, if not the only German hope for a medal outside of the relays in the World Cup. Herrmann-Wick was the only German to win two World Cups this winter. She is currently fifth in the overall World Cup. And even if the power density is significantly higher among the women at the top than among the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians are currently dominating, you had other people on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people died in the 2018 protests. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the years that followed, often for fear of reprisals or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Defense industry calls for more orders from special funds
The first armament projects have therefore already been canceled, and the same is threatening other projects, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag". However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms. "There is no need to allocate concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says the Federal Government in response to a question from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment sum is rising interest rates. The fully loan-financed special fund, which the Bundestag decided in June 2022, must bear the interest burden on the loans itself. If these increase, there is less money available for specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining amount is falling.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 1.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway exit in the direction of Heilbronn. At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, the police said. The two vehicles collided when the BMW driver made a turn.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic lights installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system revealed no objections. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be taken to a hospital. The two cars suffered material damage totaling around 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgarter commemorate the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. De sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria occupies the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people remembered the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach, young and old, women and men. They all listened earnestly and silently to the imam's supplication. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with one another. The congregation also asked for support and strength "to bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the people of Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers of supplication were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of the Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already been raised in the fundraising campaign of the German Islam Association, the Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in kind over a period of several days in Glockenstrasse, which are to be trucked to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating you should rest or take a thousand steps".... The older people know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, the good old digestive walk experienced an unexpected renaissance during the pandemic years. Because those who, thanks to the home office, are not in the middle of a stone desert, but rather only a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, can now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 2 p.m. not only dog owners cavort.
One reason could, of course, also be that people in modern times can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things in the course of making optimal use of their time slot. After all, why not learn news about the settlement from a neighbor you haven't seen for a long time on a short hike through nature? Or meet that girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? Work and private life can also be combined in this way - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor can't take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What you can also do excellently is the acquisition of natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands next to a small cash register on a table by the wayside. Or potatoes and meat. It's only stupid if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and taken the appropriate precautions. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg left the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voices. "Too bad, unfortunately we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, since you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you also let the likeable chance acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! You certainly have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which one quickly puts on before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with a piece of meat and on this short midday excursion you have not only gained a saddle of lamb, but also an extremely practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due that day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and badly injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and, for reasons that have not yet been clarified, left the road in a left turn to the right, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a delineator, crashed sideways into a tree and stopped a few meters away. The driver was trapped in his car as a result of the collision. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The ambulance took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of unfitness to drive, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has ruled that the tax authorities must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in the office of President of the USA
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the ministry's decision said on Friday.
Contrary to political practice in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted a release up to the Supreme Court. A public prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public - unless there was a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There, the circle of those entitled to access is somewhat larger and under certain conditions individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information leaks out of Parliament from time to time.
House Speaker Democrat Nancy Pelosi immediately hailed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a national security issue, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as President," Pelosi said.

British criminal caught in Thailand after long escape
LONDON - After five years on the run, a convicted British drug criminal has been arrested in Thailand. As the British criminal police NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police officers in a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's Most Wanted list.
The leader of a criminal group fled in early 2018 before the start of a trial in which he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines worth £8million, authorities said.

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the qualified physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, by his own admission, loves Viennese humor, takes a stand for science in his cabaret programmes. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits in with this. It remains to be seen whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing scientific skepticism here at home. In any case, his sense of humor suits Vienna very well.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York as a stand-up comedian for a year in 2019. But now he's back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can do and, above all, what it can't do. Of course there is also Corona, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many put off: What is really important? All this with a huge wink, calm and very ironic. And so we are not only well entertained, but can also learn something new.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat action from the point of view of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and blocks of rock that offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles that become increasingly difficult to hit as the game progresses. In addition, UFO's appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction procedure, the game initiation procedure, the game procedure, the initial entry for maximum scores, and the self-test procedure. The latter operating mode represents a special procedure for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
Game play is initiated when the START button is pressed. The LED switch stays lit and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slowly moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by observing the displayed text in the upper left corner of the hint display of his cockpit. A hint can read, for example: OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT. Additionally, a dot will appear on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, representing the enemy position.
The top cone on the radar screen represents the player's field of vision on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he can be easily targeted on the screen. At the same time, ENEMY IN THE FIRE AREA is shown in the upper left information display.
At times, UFO's will appear on screen flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that monitor the battle and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or rockets. UFO's can be eliminated from both the player tank and the enemy tank. A kill by the player earns him 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are awarded: for a slow-moving tank 1,000 points, for a missile 2,000 points and for a super tank 3,000 points. A Super Tank moves and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several options give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for one game. Furthermore, a bonus tank can be released after a given number of points has been reached and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the gameplay selector switch for this setting option can be found in the illustration.
5. Initial entry for top scores
If a player exceeds the minimum score on the high score table, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials on the table after the game has ended. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or an interruption in mains power will clear the maximum results table. Upon RESET, the ten (10) highest scores are preserved with their initials and written back onto the screen to challenge other players. Any score greater than 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, dashes will be automatically entered by the computer. The device then switches back to the attraction gameplay. BODY ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you are already familiar with Atari video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shifter. It has been reinforced with several additional ribs in the inner and outer shells, making this assembly more stable and ensuring proper operation of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always brings the control lever back to the center position. The microswitches are now secured with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuitry has been expanded to two (2) interconnected circuit boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and Auxiliary Boards. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in an even and smooth picture. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to handle the increased power supply given the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. There is also a console in the device, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players in order to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all the other main components of this device, are shown in figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Still, you should do some verification to round out the quality control. In order to be certain that the device was delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V mains yet. A. Inspect the exterior of the case for damage. B. Open the unit service hatch and check the components inside the unit as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for proper and tight connection. Connect any open or loose plugs together.
NOTE: Never use force to connect plugs. The plugs are forced-guided so that a correct connection is established. A connector twisted 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for correct and firm seating. (3) Note the serial number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check that the stamped serial numbers match those on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC Board, Auxiliary PC Board, Controller/Audio II PC Board and TV Monitor. An illustration showing the location of the production number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be quoted when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control panel and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's sight glass, check that the radar screen is also in the fairing's bright orange circled opening. If the opening is not exactly centered, the cover, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selection plug on the mains unit 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you resolve most issues related to the latest DirectX games. Checking the system configuration
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the box. You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to get an overview of your system if you are unsure whether your PC meets the requirements. Please do the following to launch the DirectX Diagnostic Tool: Click the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. Type "dxdiag" in the text box. The DirectX Diagnostics program's interface will now appear. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card. You can check whether the graphics and sound are working properly, by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound Note: Unless you have advanced computer skills, we would advise against changing any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostics program Before starting the game
Other programs may be hogging the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs make it obvious that they are active, and many start automatically when the system boots. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can cause your program to hang or crash. That's why we recommend you to close such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable" "Close" or similar). - Once you have disabled antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also kill common background applications as they sometimes cause problems when installing or running a PC game. You can read more about this in the How to Quit All Unnecessary Background Applications section. Clean up the system
Before you install any software, you need to make sure your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: use ScanDisk, Disk Defragmenter, and Disk Cleanup to keep things running smoothly. Then there is a good chance that current games will run largely problem-free on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and other applications that you use run faster and more stably. Consult the Windows help files for information about the ScanDisk or Error Checking, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click the Start button and choose Help (or Help and Support) to open Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search field and enter the appropriate keyword, e.g. B. "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Check" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive a guide explaining how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website. Below are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

Note: Depending on your system settings, pressing CTRL, ALT and DEL the Windows Security window does not appear, but the Windows Task Manager appears immediately Windows XP Home
1. Hold down the CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard, and then press DEL. The Windows Task Manager will now appear. 2. To end a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click on the corresponding entry in the task list and then click on the "End task" button. Before calling the hotline
If you want to make a call, you should sit down at your PC and have the following information ready (see the “Checking the system configuration” section). Please also prepare notes. - PC brand and model - processor type - operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (working memory) - information about graphics and sound cards and drivers
INTRODUCTION TO FAHRENHEIT
My desire to create video games was sparked by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a whole host of new possibilities and seemed like a new means of expression to push the world to its limits. It was an opportunity for me to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: while I was struggling with the still immature technology, I was also aware that there was still everything to be discovered - in particular a new language, the had to be both narrative and visual. To be perfectly honest, the next ten years didn't satiate my hunger. I had a vague feeling that video games were exploiting only a tiny fraction of their amazing creative potential because they were too focused on "action" and ignoring a fundamental element of human experience: sensation. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid advances. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true, sensuous medium of expression. While this could of course have been done in a very different way, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that isn't just about battling hideous monsters in dark corridors and banging on crates to get ammo, but about far more challenging and in-depth content. It's proof that you can both tell a story and provide game content without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you're skeptical about video games, I hope Fahrenheit will help change your mindset. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspiration, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first. For the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has provided the entire Quantic Dream team with an unforgettable human and intellectual adventure, one that has repeatedly forced us to question many of the principles we once believed to be unbreakable . I would be lucky if Fahrenheit - like books, films and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - doesn't entirely pass by without a trace. David Cage
THE README FILE

SERVICE MANUAL QIX
gameplay
By pressing the appropriate start button, the game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. Trying to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The course of the game is set in such a way that a minimum required area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. In the event of an alarm, the SPARX become SUPER SPARX and more aggressive. If while trying to draw your area your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed as you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and don't complete your area, a fuse will be lit and your marker destroyed. Two speed settings are available. If the drawing speed is slow, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, providing data and demonstrating that circuits and controls are working properly. See "Service Program" for more information. The volume can be adjusted using the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
Generally. The 4 switches - located in the device - the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used for programming and testing.
programming display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) in which the address programming and the game will work. The languages can be set using the "Sub-Test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program screen. insert programming. This display can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, a "maximum number of credits" that may be before the start of the game can be set. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" button. The factory or basic setting can be reached by pressing the "Sub-Test" button several times, when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" button". The values are reset, the pointer ( so called the lines that appear green) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to set the High Score points transmit the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits needed for a player to enter their own initials (names) and hit points on the screen. The "Max of Credit" sets a coin acceptance limit for the device. When the limit is exceeded - if coin lock is present - coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99 that inserting a coin will not cause the credits to become zero when adding over 99. A free spins mode can be selected by setting "Max Credits" to O. Other programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": Level of the percentage that must be reached in order to switch to the next run
"Time Limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Degree of difficulty of the gameplay
"Pull-on tone": at "0" no tone during stationary operation
with "1" sound also in stationary mode (animated sound) "table model": with "0" stationary device
with "1" table device
The credits per coin are set on the "Slot Programming" screen. High score program display (high hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the 10 nearest scores. The values are used to set the high score chosen on the previous display (set from "back"). By pressing the "Up" button, the initials QIX Standard are set. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Overall evaluation". By pressing the "Up" button The switch can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of credits paid The total is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over The total can only appear as 0 , when the battery or connector W1 is removed, with the device switched off Left-side coins: number of coins inserted - in the left coin slot - Middle coins: (none) Right-side coins: number of coins inserted - in the right coin slot. Credits Paid: Number of credits given for inserted (converted coins). Credits Granted: Number of credits granted by the device. % Free Spins: Credits Granted (Paid + Credits Granted per 100) Minutes Played: Number of minutes played. Minutes Won: Number of minutes when the game was extended or won. % Free Time: Minutes Gained/Minutes Played per 100. Average Game Time in Sec: Minutes Played/Credits Paid + Granted
High Score: Number of times a player had high enough hit rates to displace other players from the high score list. The values are set to 0 by pressing the "Up" switch. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Slot programming/normal money setting. Using this display, a default coin setting can be selected by the operator, or a different setting can be programmed
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons will select programming while the top digit is lit green on the screen. The size values change as the digit changes. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" button, the setting is accepted. If a setting that does not correspond to the standard setting is required, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that you can set your own. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not appropriate. Once the adjustment is made, any new variable to be adjusted can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. If you press it unintentionally, the standard setting appears. The values can be increased or reduced with the "Up" and "Down" buttons. The process is ended by pressing the "Test" button. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") says how many coin units are given for each coin inserted - through an assigned slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units shows the units required before a bonus credit is issued. "Min Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. In the default setting, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM where all programming is stored has failed. All values stored in RAM are restored to factory defaults. This condition probably indicates battery failure or failure.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the 'Sub-Test' button or the 'Self-Test' button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display , by pressing the "Test” button the next program is displayed. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test starts in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is powered off When the message "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, the program plug J 19, 1-2 must be inserted. If connector J 19 is removed, the memory (memory) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be carried out Hardware tests: These tests are carried out as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM contains errors, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decode plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the integrity of the memory shared by two processors by storing a predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking that the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error can be caused by defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To localize the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Error in U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values are written to another part of memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test passes, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the circuits connected to them or the decoding.
Test video board color RAM by storing predetermined sequences of numbers in the color RAM. These numbers are checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared to the original template. Any discrepancy will halt the program and the LED's will indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next test is starting (data hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must exist and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That's also the reason for Star #1. The 2nd for the correct jacket arriving with no apparent seam defects. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. I based myself on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it's supposed to be so tight and I didn't want to fight my bust size into an S or M... In the end it would have fit in terms of length and hips... I could swim the rest of the way. In addition, the lining material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere. Just a shame.. It will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she absolutely loves it. She usually wears the 158 and in this case the 36 fits her quite well and will definitely be worn again next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that's not ideal. Unfortunately, I took my measurements and the edition doesn't quite fit. But what is my fault. Then I changed it a bit to make it fit. The pad is very robust and the edges are no longer damaged. You can use the groove or the whole surface. Worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again right away.
Unfortunately too big for less than 1 year
The product itself is okay, but not less than a year. Since the area to chew is much too big for the small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months and he couldn't use it because of the size. Now at 12 months we have picked him out again and he can use him. Hasn't been able to bite anything yet with the few teeth he already has. And when he was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.
Insufficient quality / unfortunately has to be returned
I guess I was fooled by some of the raving reviews here. I would like to say in advance that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing gear) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack came yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for less than 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that (as written in many reviews) it can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at far higher prices.... folks, that's just not true! I really hoped that would be the case, but there's really no question of that. The padded walls are much thinner and don't offer the same protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside are of a different caliber, much more flimsy. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for small items are not exactly of high quality either. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to pay for a decent backpack. Apparently, quality has its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like it was a difficult decision for me either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I really liked is the color inside. Here you will definitely find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is definitely a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
So far I've enjoyed EL Todd's Electrics series best, but this book has changed my mind. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. That part is all about Volt and Taylor's feelings and I felt it was unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself, and then every time he fights, he's like a little kid and rips off?! At the same time there were also discrepancies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor would like him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do it without him and he heard it myself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I was hoping that this would be the last installment in the series and I think this installment is the weakest and also quite unnecessary at the same time. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would add more excitement to the story.
People destroy everything, don't appreciate anything and don't learn! First of all: The film isn't that bad as many write. Sure, of course the story is totally constructed and designed according to the same pattern over and over again. If you've seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: people destroy everything and don't appreciate anything and don't learn! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often did I just think about the film (even though I know that it's just a film and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there are often tears in your eyes . So Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is really well done. It's just a shame that the man just doesn't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and us too. Out of greed and greed, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living things: none. 4 stars because the film is well made, but unfortunately always based on the same principle, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This film isn't a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't intend to be one. This film is primarily "French" - it's also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90's, because of orange, but that doesn't matter either. A packet every morning for 5 days: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing. My waist circumference has increased by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite stopping immediately, the diarrhea has been there for a week. It should be noted that only 2 stars were given for the smaller packaging size (unfortunately seen too late), for the larger full 5? This is very very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blond hair a chocolate brown in October with an intensive tint, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I have used the product twice. The first time I noticed it smelled terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out about chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfactory. This time it was a complete waste of time! It didn't make a difference, my hair looked like it did the first time. Worst of all, it still stunk weeks after using it.. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly recommended
I've been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance had been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and an additional, longer illness. I wanted to give my immune system a little boost not only with a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works very well. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets for. Highly Recommended.
Not working properly!!! After using the battery case for 3 months, I discovered the following major defects, which I find very annoying: 1) Over time, the case has problems "connecting" to the cell phone. This means that it is no longer loaded even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and putting it back in solves the problem in 70% of cases, but creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the cell phone in the case, the cover has become so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. These aren't many major flaws, but I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly in its function and that's why, for the price of €30, I'm very disappointed with the product, especially since I've only had it for 3 months use.
Far too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews came about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get from any optician in a slightly smaller form as a gift. The cleaning effect is as good as that of a kitchen towel and no better. I expected a lot more from these towels, it's also really, really thin. Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it. I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these towels is far exaggerated. You shouldn't give more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker I received as a giveaway broke unfortunately. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I dropped it in the shower), plays bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come loose... it can play sound very loud... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As said, bass is rendered as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. While my old speaker didn't reproduce bass well as bass, the frequencies were presented fairly naturally at volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. So I have to deduct a star for that. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
The paint had chipped off in a few places and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint also came off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up free of charge because we no longer wanted them, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but as if both dressers were damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did everything for us and gave us the money back. Kudos to Amazon
Rather spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. Individual parts are supplied which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packaged in a plain envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no other protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I didn't fault it as I needed this product badly. The supplied adhesive hardly sticks, but sticks properly - like chewing gum, which does not harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that everything does not stick together. The templates are partially punched out incomplete. Okay for one-time use and as a gag for a party, but for a wedding I would invest a little more money and get a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, although the instructions aren't that clear. + Magnetic clasps + Nice look + Stable when assembled + Shelf board can be positioned anywhere
- Doors slam through magnets (maybe you can compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean spots
- the dowels supplied are much too small and wobble (didn't have any other ones and since there wasn't a trophy in the house, they were glued on with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped it with some paper and compensated) Conclusion: if it doesn't would look so good and have such good measurements I would give less stars as you have to make everything fit to be really happy. Also, I think it's a bit overpriced for that.
I like the coffee...but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packed, see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full marks soon.
I'm getting on my nerves
The alarm came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural noises sound terrible, and extremely loud at that. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that's possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I fell out of bed immediately. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned to face the alarm clock, thinking it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and the color change, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also found it good that it has a battery so that the clock and alarm time do not have to be re-entered in the event of a power failure. But returned for the reasons stated.
Light super, processing insufficient
I replaced four bulbs in the house with these bulbs. Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board smiles at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - get 4" is not a good deal. Surely Amazon would have sorted it out quickly and accommodatingly, but I only found that out after the return deadline. So I see it as my fault and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for deducting two stars. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated. The light color is more in the direction of cold white. Perfect for the hallway, study, workroom, laundry room, etc. For living spaces, I would personally use warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also do this and I may also get intact specimens there according to the order. If my rating is of any help, I would be happy to receive a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures and I would like to share my first look. yes positive I thought long and hard about ordering this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole in the handle for hanging ** The soft silicone won't scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially handy to use on pans with a coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440℉. **They also do not transmit heat and can therefore be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But shortly after wipe and they are gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it
B-Ware sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping just great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked the water tap and checked all the parts. Here we found that the part had already been installed. We noticed significant scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The hose fittings/connectors were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that scratches / streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably been shipped and returned before. We keep this faucet and put it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like there. Our conclusion; We will never order such goods from Amazon again, but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we can get decent goods. Just find it sad that customers are so fooled!!!
The product itself is great, but unfortunately the outdoor sensor broke after just 6 months
In principle I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy and the radio range is also very good, with no problems with transmission from the inside to the outside. I also like the design of the device. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of the outside air humidity are always displayed. That's a shame, since the device was attached to a protected spot on the outside and is also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Powerful mower with a weak grass collector
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery as of today is still happily driving through the Republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service in triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and the result is a nice sectional view. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the catch basket is a big shortcoming. For one thing, it's only hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you put it down for just a short time, it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. Worse, however, is that the level indicator, which is actually practical, shows red when the grass catcher is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Always emptying the basket when it is only half full on a large lawn cannot be the solution. So I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate construction of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me.
Good device for surveillance
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The supplied plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only shown once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to save battery power. I only give 4 stars for the following reasons. - The soft rear wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again with great difficulty. - One of the two devices is in a room with fairly thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a bit louder.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately I haven't managed to level the hotbed properly yet. The right rear locking screw is fully tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there and the front right screw falls out, as it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The bars holding the cart are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what to do there, because it's impossible to print something like that. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you would have to re-lay them several times, which is very tiring. I have already written to support but after a week of waiting I still haven't gotten an answer. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back. I was expecting a little more.
robust and precise am positively surprised
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be found. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full marks and I think it lasts at least as long as the old caliper. There is a clear purchase recommendation from mit and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
Bought the bracelet and haven't worn it for the time being because it has a disgusting smell. This smell hasn't gone away to this day, even though it's been "ventilated" all the time. After it was no longer possible to return it, I threw it away. Discontinue purchase
OK for the price
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me personally, so that it looks quite massive. The larger balls can be moved freely, which I find really nice. However, the chain is processed very simply overall, so that I have already torn open the clasp twice. So far I've been able to repair it again and again, but I don't think it will last long. But you can't really expect anything of high quality for the low price.
Very nice piece of jewellery
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't unravel, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it a little softer and more cuddly. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that the goods were used. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after some gimmicking.... if you follow the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and put it back in did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. The display of the three channels was also very different! All in all, useless for me! The thing went back! In any case, I would advise against buying it, it will only bring trouble!
transport damage
Hello, I've had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the inner shaft rusted after 3.5 years. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections for the suction line and the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a manufacturing defect and that the current pump will serve a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump was damaged in transit, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
Could have thought better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than walking around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. At first everything went quite well. However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws had to be tightened again and again. It's nice that you can do that with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I couldn't find a suitable slotted screwdriver that didn't immediately ruin the whole screw. Now for the most annoying part: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can set the screw to different sizes or lengths thanks to the different parts, but once you've screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to get the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the third time I installed it, the screw in the thread broke off, making the whole thing unusable. Conclusion: If at all, you only need all the necessary keys once and then never again, but at this price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Doesn't quite match the dimensions given
Smooth-running zippers, the material seems robust and all of it featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually judge the goods after the first use. First of all, I can say that the height is less than stated. At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there, for example for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the case - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, since the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/bags. Not of high quality, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of a different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.
So-so
So, ordered before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now when I wanted to use it again, it wouldn't. Battery? exchanged. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money straight into the garbage can.
Care is always good! The application is easy, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life is very long. Definitely perfect sound. I liked the fact that the headphones don't hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
nice dress
Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions. Value for money is right here, especially since I also bought it on a lightning sale. It fits my size perfectly, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so low and the sleeves could do with a little more fabric (unless your upper arms are as narrow as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously didn't expect such junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD works normally, Blu-rays are recognized unreliably at most. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which Rödel makes noises that have not been heard since the 1990s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because nothing will work, or the disc will finally be recognized. But then you can't press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port that faces up is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging some devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a vile extension I certainly wouldn't have bought this bulky lump with gold connectors. But apart from the optics and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is limited :-).
Small but great! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I had to send back could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous loading is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter which can be attached to the tablet. This should bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case it doesn't fit with the adapter. Well, it's also safe and has contact from there... All in all, a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and made stable in one aluminum piece. Price-performance fits.
Loads of power
Top device. Has been running for months with no problems. It's not exactly light or quiet, but it performs well. I think the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) is a bit too cool and I am therefore always on level 2. Has fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived it well. And I like the simple design too. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a good impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can recommend them unreservedly.
Great product with weak battery
We've had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the location is accurate to what feels like 0.5m. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters, which is not disturbing. I would buy it again anytime. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. He currently lasts about 1.5 hours a day. A solution that would take 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version, but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, the battery would not have to last that long and we also find it impractical to change it every day. One should deal with the dog not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
Garbage after a few weeks
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem comfortable too. However, the lifespan decreases more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education class, the sole broke after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. The last pair also didn't last very long in normal use, but I figured it would do for class. Unfortunately, it was not like that. The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I owned before. At first glance there doesn't seem to be any difference either, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the strap on the heel is quite loose and very likely won't last five years like my previous ones. I am excited!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on the off chance that I was lucky. The scope of delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope it doesn't appear again. A lying test was carried out directly in the inflated state. It's easy to lie on and goes great with the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but it is pure luxury for days at the event. The mattress fits perfectly in my car. Before that, we removed the seats in the back. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump plugs into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the solder joint). As my friend is handy, he was able to fix it and put it back together the good part worked great and pumped up the mattress in no time. Overall I am very pleased with the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope it doesn't lose any air and lasts a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not appear again. After the test I can definitely recommend it. If I should have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar ripped open over several doors right on day 1 due to the silly processing. On the 21st door, there were no more doors on it and I more or less had to mine my Son allow him to take out the rest of the parts as well since they came falling towards him.The parts often come out mixed up which often means that you have to take the car apart again to put the parts on.After the car is completely put back together parts fall off while playing. (Mostly the front screen. This is also very difficult to put back on.) I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers will reconsider the way they design the calendar have for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I'm excited about the drone. My 7 year old daughter flies it. Indoors, it flies very well and the 5-minute flight time is usually quite sufficient. I didn’t expect hair to get caught in it and the drone to break very quickly given the price, but falls from the ceiling onto the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. Contact us if you have any questions.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. Didn't see when I bought it that it wasn't a game CD, just a code to download the game. That's fine so far, but you're forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is rude. Since then the computer hangs up constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails because of the battery life
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and optics great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. The service worked well... and yet I send it back. The big snags are the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, just left on the cupboard overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already dead by noon / early afternoon and then you can no longer even read the time. Therefore not useful for me. Too bad.
Noble cover with limitations
You should definitely get a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+. I recently liked cases that you can also put your credit card in. This is what the case offers here. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it will be too much, then the lid will be a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and appears to be well made. She looks classy. In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only the connections have cut-outs. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on/off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. It doesn't even work on the QI leather charging station from TORRO. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
high-quality case with tempered glass film
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be opened easily. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It's not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone. Overall a good buy.
