In the shadow of extinction: Three cheetah cubs born in Iran
The world's fastest animal is falling victim to brutal hunting, droughts and deadly road accidents across the Islamic Republic •
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asian cheetah cubs recently emerged into the world's air in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
It is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic condition of the animal which is endangered in the country following droughts, hunts and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of a cheetah in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported that the veterinary team in charge of the Turan National Park in the northern province of Semnan decided on a caesarean birth in captivity.
It was also noted that less than 20 cheetahs have been documented in seven different districts of the state in recent times.
In the wake of the danger of their extinction, the United Nations executed a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now, in Iran, it is hoped the new cubs could bring about an increase in the cheetah population in the future.
Last January, Iran's Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs Hassan Akbari said that the country's cheetah population had dramatically shrunk from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to just 12 cheetahs.
"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that the cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their living areas, hunting and even road accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching a speed of about 100 km / h.
Cheetahs can be found in various places around the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: We tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify began to try its luck in the world of hardware as well •
After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the US •
We got our hands on the first device in Israel •
Make your old cars smart.
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with older vehicles.
A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to individual experimenters in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the shipment was outstanding, as our home vehicle broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.
After two weeks of toying around, I realized how the car thing could easily become an integral part of many people's system.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will prefer to use other solutions already.
From idea to reality
Sometime in 2018, Spotify users started receiving an interesting offer in their email inbox - the option to purchase a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which would turn any old car system into a smart one.
The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company was planning to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connections.
A few months later, these rumors returned to the headlines again after the music service was updated with the vehicle mode - the same one we now know from the app - which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled "Car Thing," its smart system for vehicles, last April.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipments.
So of course, right after the press conference she held, I went on the website and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
Reconnecting to the site will give me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise - it will not cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The car thing thing
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me greatly with its build quality.
And a little smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a large, bright and sharp touch screen on the front than I expected.
Also, you'll find alongside the screen a round button and dial that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the photos, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively thin profile and not protrude too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would have preferred the company to allow changing the activity of the dial in order for me to control the volume of the smartphone, as I can also navigate using the touchscreen.
Perhaps this will be possible in a future version update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for installing it.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.
The Car Thing certainly brings that feeling back with its form.
All the adapters were attached to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
In addition, throughout the top you can find small buttons, which can be easily set to play various playlists or podcasts.
By long-pressing one of the buttons while listening, or by a request from the voice assistant, I set up some playlists that I hear frequently and the radio show that I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel like the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From an old car to a smart car
After a fairly simple physical setup, I connected the Car Thing to the mains.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote, so it can copy all our account information from it.
That means you'll still need to connect your smartphone to the car, either via Bluetooth or an AUX cable, to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, as like the application on a smartphone, it puts an emphasis on the album images and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations according to your taste, the search screen and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touchscreen or using the manual dial.
Moreover, you can at any given moment call the device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify."
With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums, and even search for podcasts.
From Sony, she recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was blowing directly on the device.
This is probably due to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of the article, there is no information about when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for him?
My experience of using the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me given that it's still in an initial release phase.
Even with intensive use on long journeys, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, from time to time there is a small stutter in the interface, but I believe that Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.
It is evident that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and among the various versions that have leaked on the Internet during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to designate it for.
After all, his activity boils down to controlling the app on the smartphone, and not much beyond that.
How is it different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and connecting it so that the smartphone is closer to us when driving?
That question is reinforced when considering that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and most times will buy the user a lot more functionality.
Despite all this, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
Being able to see the Waze on my smartphone screen and control the music on a completely different screen, is one I've learned to appreciate over the past two weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it be launched here in our small country as well?
The Swedish company is not telling much at the moment.
It hasn't even shared how many experimenters for the device it's currently running around the world, and how many it plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is that the price is expected to be $79.
In the meantime, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse of a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said that there is currently no information about a plan to launch the device in Israel.

Did you recruit talent for the company?
Make sure your competitors don't "steal" it from you.
The economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talents.
Here are some tips to help you keep it safe in the workplace
.
Despite the increase recorded in the last month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be among the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among the OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talents.
As for those professionals and managers who are centers of proven knowledge, experience and ability - the trends in the labor market show that competition for them, the talents as they are called by employers, still exists in full force.
What this means for employers is that in the current state of the labor market, they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after the recruitment of a coveted talent, since as soon as he enters the company's gates - another company will already try to kidnap him.
In other words, the competition for talent is so fierce that many, even after they are recruited, will continue to receive a variety of tempting job offers, with 30% of employees actually leaving only a month after receiving the job and starting work.
This is why smart employers will immediately move from the stage of recruiting talent to the stage of retaining it, when the path begins first and foremost with preparation in advance and taking creativity already in the process of absorbing it.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful absorption process will make the talent excited about his new workplace from the very first day and even look forward to the future.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper absorption process that will help preserve the new talent:
It's not a secret - sharing and organization readiness <unk>
Share the factors that will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is vital and important to the company and the role, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and understands his value, will feel welcome and strive to prove the expectations placed on him.
Knowledge is power - coordinating expectations
Already on the first day, they held a conversation with the talent to coordinate expectations.
Get to know his professional background and see where he sees himself in the future, so you can introduce him to the diverse and unique tools you and the workplace can provide him to get there.
We are all people - personal acquaintance
During the days of absorption, try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and take an interest in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who shows interest in him and allows him to realize and express himself beyond the limits of his job will appreciate this and want to keep it.
Curiosity is promoted <unk>
Already at the absorption stage, you can create an attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily by talking about bonuses and benefits, but by exposing him to an exciting field or an interesting technology, since such stimuli to creativity lead to curiosity and growing interest in the workplace.
Also, encourage the talent to voice his thoughts and opinions on the various projects in the company and make it clear to him that they are important to the organization.

Electrification in your pocket: The cost of not closing coal-fired power plants in June - NIS 1 billion
A report by the Knesset Research and Information Center: The failure to close the coal plants on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion
• The Electric Company: "The fuel use policy is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"
.
The economic cost of not closing the coal plants on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is embodied in the consumer electricity tariff, which is expected to increase in the coming months due to the rise in the cost of coal.
In addition, in 2023, an additional excess amount of coal use of about 900,000 tons is expected, so this will be reflected in an additional cost to the electricity economy for not closing the coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas will remain significantly lower relative to the price of coal.
The report states that the reduction of about NIS 1 billion in the electricity tariff in 2022 meant a reduction of about 4% in the electricity consumption tariff for the home consumer.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about NIS 1 billion, and the total discount that could have been given to the home consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the reform of the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the Electric Company, which will build units powered by natural gas, designed to replace the 4-1 coal-fired units at the Orot Rabin site.
Following this decision, a government decision was adopted in July 2018, which states that the operation of the 4-1 coal-fired production units at the Orot Rabin power plant must be stopped.
The decision set timetables, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly, the coal-fired production units 4-1 will also cease to operate on this date.
The electricity company said in response: "The fuel use policy is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the ministry's decisions, a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas. "
Paying the price: Everything you need to know ahead of the interest rate rise
Decrees constantly: Next week the interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent •
How much will the payment on the mortgage cost?
And what is recommended to do? •
All the answers
The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% over the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts' estimates speak of a rate of increase ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.
If the interest rate does rise by half a percentage point, it will already be 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
This is after years of interest rates being close to zero.
The sharp increase in the interest rate makes mortgage repayments hundreds of shekels more expensive and weighs drastically on households.
With the help of Shai Bundle, a mortgage expert, we looked at how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.
If the interest rate rises by half a percent - how much will the monthly payment on the mortgage cost?
On a mortgage of NIS 1.2 million, which consists of a 40% prime interest rate track, the monthly repayment will increase by NIS 125.
How much has the average mortgage gone up by since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, this is a significantly sharper increase.
This is because interest rates in the other tracks that make up mortgages (and not just in the prime track) have also risen - in the index-linked track and in the fixed interest rate track.
If the interest rate does rise by half a percent, the increase in price will amount, according to Zror's estimate, to about NIS 620 on a mortgage of about NIS 1.2 million.
The prime route (40% in this route) will complete an increase of about NIS 280, assuming that there will be an increase of another 0.5% next month.
The index-linked variable interest rate track (26.7% in this track) will complete a rise in price of about NIS 120.
The fixed interest rate track - not indexed (33.3% in this track) will become more expensive by NIS 220.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have a mortgage that is mostly indexed, Bundle recommends considering recycling to non-indexed routes.
For mortgage holders whose monthly repayments have increased significantly and it is difficult for them to meet repayments - he recommends looking into recycling a mortgage and redeploying it for a longer period.
This is to reduce payments despite the increase in interest rates, as it is always better to meet repayments and not be insolvent.
Regarding new mortgage takers - he strongly recommends getting to know the different routes and adjusting the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
The same applies in the future when interest rates fall they will be able to do mortgage recycling with minimal early repayment fees.
Regarding apartment buyers from a contractor - Bundle recommends making payments to the contractor ahead of time and taking out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "construction input index" raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract is signed.
The residential construction input price index increased by 6.6% over the past year.
Against the background of the increase in the cost of this measure, the Banking Supervision Department announced yesterday that it is considering mandating the creation of a mechanism that will allow the linkage to be included in the mortgages, but the final decision on the issue has not yet been made.
The price of gas is rising - and Israelis will have to pay more than 8 shekels per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price for a liter of 95-octane gasoline will be NIS 8.08.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the tax on diesel will be extended until the end of 2022
A record of a decade: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 cents per liter - and will stand from July 1 at more than 8 shekels per liter.
The new price for a liter of 95-octane gasoline will be -8.08 and those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay another 21 cents per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022 - the tax authority said.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continued rise in oil prices, against the backdrop of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in the dollar rate.
Had it not been for the half-shekel discount that the government has been subsidizing since April, the price of gas would have passed the all-time high of NIS 8.25 per liter.
The discount expires at the end of July and the Tax Authority and the Treasury are currently promoting the publication for public comment of a decree extending the reduction in the tax on gasoline, which is half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
Also, starting on August 10, a further reduction of another half shekel will be established, so that only from this date the price of a liter of gasoline will decrease by one shekel until November 15, 2022.
This was reported by the Tax Authority.
"We have reached a situation where I do not remember five months in a row of a surplus in state revenues.
We started a few months ago with the issue of tax cuts on diesel.
We have been working for a week on a four-month extension of the excise, gasoline and diesel tax - instead of half a shekel per shekel.
It's good for the industry and the citizenry.
If we lower, it will affect inflation, lower production and ease the cost of living.
As finance minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus first and foremost on this, "Lieberman said at the Horwitz Conference on Economics and Society of the Israel Democracy Institute.
To date, more than half of the price of fuel is the taxes collected by the government (excise tax and VAT) - and this is a high rate of taxation compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business expenses, the prices of public transportation and flights, transportation costs, and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the most business-friendly city
Petah Tikva came in second place in the ranking of doing business by the Ministry of Economy
After them: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon LeZion •
Minister Barbibai: "The corona has highlighted the importance of local government in business development"
.
Ashdod is the most friendly city for small and medium-sized businesses.
This is the third year in a row that the Doing Business in Local Authorities Index of the Agency for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses at the Ministry of Economy and Industry has ranked local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place is Rehovot.
They are followed by Ashkelon, Rishon Lezion, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the Local Authorities Index.
This is the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a working tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance with other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on several parameters that are tested in each authority, which examine the level of "friendliness" of the authority to businesses in its area.
The index divides the authorities into three size groups according to the number of residents, since a local authority of up to 50,000 residents is not comparable to a local authority of more than 150,000 residents.
TA surged this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: Business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information and property taxes.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth to 12th place and Netanya dropped from fifth to 13th place.
A decrease in the rating does not mean that the authority's service to businesses has deteriorated, and in many cases it is due to the fact that the service of other authorities to businesses has improved more and they have risen in the rating, while the authority that has decreased in the rating has improved its services to businesses less.
Among those rising in the ranking are Petah Tikva, which rose from sixth to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
"Business as an engine of growth"
The ranking shows that Nof Hagalil leads in local authorities with between 50,000 and 150,000 residents.
It is followed by Kiryat Motzkin, Mata Binyamin, Modiin-Maccabim-Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
In the 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The measure is intended to encourage local authorities to facilitate small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the date of opening the business and throughout its activity with the authorities," says Economy and Industry Minister Orna Barbibai.
"Businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of business output and about 60% of those employed in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses that are in it.
The coronavirus has highlighted the importance of local government and we have seen that authorities that have acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, have become the first governmental interface for them. "
Ran Koiti, director of the Small and Medium Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and essential role in the ability of businesses in their field to thrive and flourish.
In the last two years, when we are dealing with the coronavirus crisis, the authorities have a greater weight in helping businesses survive in their field and survive in general. "
2021 in the mail: 20 packages for every household - and a surge in their weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020
The average weight per package is 435 grams - a jump of 36% compared to 2020 •
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight was 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail packages arrived in Israel, almost 20 packages on average per household - according to Israel Post data obtained by "Israel Today."
The number of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019, when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there was a jump of more than 36% in the weight of packages arriving from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, a jump of 36% compared to 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per package jumped by 60% in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The surge in the weight of packages is mainly influenced by two major trends, both on the part of the seller and the buyer: The largest shopping sites abroad combine items into one shipment and no longer send each product from the "shopping basket" in separate packaging.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the fast delivery of shipments, within a few days of ordering, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which buyers want to receive near the time of purchase.
Also in 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month in which the most packages arrived from abroad with the highest weight and the highest number of items is December, with 4.2 million packages with a total weight of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
The Black Friday effect
More packages arrived in December than any other month, probably following the November shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Large orders begin to arrive in Israel between one and two weeks after the purchase.
Survey: Most Americans Don't Know They Can Get Tax Refunds
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels.
Have you changed place of work?
Did you go out to the ICU?
Have you moved out of town?
You may be entitled to receive a substantial amount in a simple procedure •
All the details - inside.
Most employees are not aware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can accumulate to high amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report from about two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of NIS 3.6 billion, which means that you should also check whether you are eligible to receive tax refunds.
Many hires can receive a high amount, as four out of five hires are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, however, they serve several tens of thousands of hires a year.
If you think that these funds went to waste anyway, think again: Employees can apply to the IRS for refunds for six years back.
Tax: On conducted an in-depth study among 4,000 of its clients regarding tax returns during 2020.
The company has more than 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their dispersion in terms of population groups and in terms of gender, age and geography.
The data shows that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the corona crisis and the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of employees on HALAT, there were a number of significant changes, mainly a 15% increase in the average return to a household, which amounted to NIS 4,300 per year.
The reason is that the salary is lower than the salary and therefore there is a gap between what the employee paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received in 2020 by a client of the company was NIS 121,054 for refunds over the past 6 years.
What can I get a tax refund for?
One of the reasons to get tax refunds is a change in workplace.
81% of the people who changed jobs during the year received an average tax refund of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of women who gave birth and were on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to a refund of an average of NIS 3,538 for that year.
Another reason for the refund is donations.
100% of people who donate and pay taxes have been reimbursed.
Another factor for reimbursement is not registering credits for alimony. 63%
The divorced did not update a credit point for alimony, so the tax refund for each year that such a credit point was not updated is NIS 2,616.
Due to Unemployment - Expenditure on Social Security: 93% of those who became sick or unemployed and earned over NIS 12,000 received a tax refund of NIS 4,021 for the same year.
Other reasons for tax refunds are: Reimbursement for life insurance payments, life insurance on a mortgage, reimbursement for qualifying return, reimbursement for losses in securities, failure to register credit points for a man for giving birth, and distribution of tax refunds by geographic location.
- 94% of people who deposited for personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In an examination conducted on each million shekels of a 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax refund for the period is over 20,000 shekels for the entire mortgage period
100% of those who move to a qualifying settlement received a tax refund for the transition year, since confirmation of residency in a qualifying settlement is given only after 12 months from the date the resident becomes a qualifying resident, and thus in fact the first year full tax is paid.
79% of the customers holding securities were entitled to the tax refund of the said years.
However, it is important for those who hold securities to check every year since losses are not rolled over from year to year but only through the filing of a report.
56% of men who had a child do not record credit points in the year of birth on the pay slip.
The repayment rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
CEO of tax: On, Tal Carmon: "The coronavirus crisis has caused the salaried public in Israel to become much more active.
He takes an interest, checks and demands what he deserves in refunds from the IRS.
It turns out that the fact that hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been sitting at home, in HALAT or after layoffs, for months on end, has caused many employees to take a deep look at what they deserve from the state.
It is important to know that today it is possible to carry out all the procedures for obtaining tax returns digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past. "
Job market: Fewer job applicants, more pay
AllJobs Report for 2021: At the top of demand - jobs without experience •
The volume of jobs offered increased by 50% •
"Looking for a job, but not storming the market"
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decrease in the number of resumes sent, and an average of only 23 candidates competed for each position, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year - according to a report by the Olajobs website summarizing the year 2021, on the coronavirus crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were mainly interested in job-rich areas such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, jobs without experience led the demand with more than 38 thousand searches - probably due to the return of young people without professional experience to look for immediate work, at the end of the salary payments.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and maintenance had just under 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the coronavirus crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average wage in Israel stood at NIS 11,675 gross.
The average monthly salary in the software field was NIS 17,915, and in information systems analysis it was NIS 17,140.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a wage gap of more than NIS 2,000: In the center of the country it was NIS 12,500 on average, compared to NIS 10,795 in the north and NIS 10,135 in the south.
From a gender perspective, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the number of hours worked, remained at 36%.
Men earned NIS 13,295, while women earned NIS 9,740.
Trying to get back in the furrow
On the business side, there was lateral growth in almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses longed for working hands.
Thus, the supply of jobs increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40 thousand jobs in Alljobs.
A survey conducted by the site among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their financial status in 2022, 30% of them indicated their intention to increase total recruitments but 72% understand that they will have difficulty doing so this year.
The largest supply was for jobs without experience - and there were more than 58 thousand of them on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration positions with about 44,000 jobs in each area, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and warehouses still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Boimfeld, director of research and content at Oljobs: "Job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs in their eyes.
Also, the prolonged disconnection from the work cycle makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to earn a living. "

"Not taken for granted": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrates the fact that "we can live the way we want," is excited to meet the audience and makes sure to spend time with the children •
Weekend and Independence Day of Kobi Shimoni, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
Weekends are the most important days of my life.
Faith and tradition are deep in my heart.
My Fridays are dedicated to children, Or (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and groceries for Kiddush, have lunch and do something fun together, like play football, ride horses or play with cars on a sign.
Sometimes we go to the sea, or even just to wash the car, but we always stop on the way to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store - and there is always another excuse.
When we return home with the gifts, the smells of cooking greet us. "
What does your Friday dinner look like?
"I was blessed with the cooks around me.
On my side there is Persian-Tunisian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, poetry and joy.
From the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
When we get to my mother-in-law, already from the lobby of the building, amazing smells come up from her apartment.
I usually do the Kiddush, together with the children, who know it by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is to pass out on the carpet, and the kids jump on me like I'm some inflatable. "
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"As a child, I would wake up on Shabbat to the sound of Israeli music on Network C and to the skits of the Pale Tracker, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every corner of the country made him proud.
He died three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Kiddush and Shabbat were holy of holies, mainly in the sense that the whole family should be together.
I recently released a song in his memory called'Keeping You Safe, 'which I created with Usher Cohen.
I believe he would have been proud of this work, which sanctifies the bond between father and son. "
Soon we will celebrate the 74th Independence Day. As an ardent Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a sacred day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who is privileged to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I would climb trees and tie wires with Israeli flags to the house.
Today, my days of independence are full of concerts, and I always meet an insanely happy audience, which celebrates the fact that we can live the way we want.
We must ensure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren also have this opportunity, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted. "
Her Friday: Estee Zakheim Welcomes the Sabbath
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": A Friday dinner that Esti Zakheim dreams of, and how does she cope with the fact that her husband keeps Shabbat?
Tell us about your preparations for Saturday.
.
"The preparations start as early as Thursday night, when I return from a show or a workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking such as goulash, roasts and sauces.
On Fridays, in the first part of the day, I devote time to myself, meeting with friends and friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I attend rehearsals.
In the summer, the Saturdays come in late, and I have plenty of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just a good series.
At Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Varda, who celebrated her 89th birthday, and also friends. "
Can you share more cooking?
"I like the short cuts.
For instance, instead of peeling 10 onions, slicing and dicing, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry it.
On my Shabbat table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
I do most of the cooking, and of course they heat up on the platter on Saturday.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and in the winter - the cholent. "
Your husband is a religious man and you are from a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with a Shabbat keeper is an endless compromise.
"And you shall love your neighbor as yourself," in effect.
For family trips, he can't go out, so I found myself many times packing up the kids and joining friends' family trips.
In addition, I am also the children's driver on duty, the one who brings them back on Friday night from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Shabbat, because I usually don't show up on Shabbat and get a kind of'forced vacation '- and that's good. "
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
"I would open a big table and invite my dead.
Sometimes I imagine what would have happened if my brother Daniel had been alive, or if my father, Shneur, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
We must have been talking a lot about football and politics and languishing between the two. "
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
We were a warm and united family.
On Friday at noon, my mother would prepare a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pita from the market, and burn eggplants for a tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hannah's in Yad Eliyahu, or as she used to say, Yad Eliyke, and she would make lynchings.
Since only I didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the brothers, and took care of me.
On Saturdays we would do a tour with my father in the port of Jaffa, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing. "

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck got engaged
Nearly two decades after their love story ended in separation, Lopez and Affleck are back in each other's arms •
Lopez broke up with baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
.
His one: Nearly two decades after their first love story ended in separation and a year after the highly publicized comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic circle and are engaged.
Lopez shared the news with fans on her official website onthejlo.com on Friday night.
.
The news of the engagement comes after this week Lopez was documented walking around with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative on her behalf confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
Remember, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and offered Lopez (52) to be his forever it was in 2002, and then it was an eye-popping ring with a huge six-carat pink diamond, estimated at about $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two broke up in 2004, accusing the media of over-obsession and incessant rummaging through their lives.
Since then, Affleck managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as you know, has been married 3 times before, including to singer Marc Anthony, who together became parents to twins.
Lopez's most recent romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, whom she broke up with in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians: "You can't make up what's happening to us."
"The chaos is never-ending," mom Kris Jenner insists of the new series starring reality TV's first family, getting backing from her daughters and the new producer •
In an article that will be published in "Shishat" magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR mill, the brand factory and the change that Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm no longer the one who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie should be uploaded"
It may surprise many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 of the Disney content empire, which among other things also includes the Marvel films and "Star Wars," is the Kardashian family.
The details of the contract of the first family of reality TV and social networks with Disney were not disclosed, but estimates say that a minimum amount of one hundred million dollars was transferred to the daughters of the family, who now also function as producers.
At a press meeting with the stars, each of them accompanied by an entire beauty team that takes care of makeup, hair and wrinkles in clothes non-stop, the family insisted, as well as their new and sought-after producer, that this time it is not reality, this time what is received on the screen is completely authentic.
"It's impossible to make up what's happening to us," the family's mom Kris Jenner says emphatically, "the chaos is never-ending."
"We're showing how much we've grown since that series came out in 2007," says Khloe Kardashian.
"When we started, we were terrified, a lot happens to us in life and it is impossible to confine everything simply to a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
A lot of plots were expedited in the edit, wrapped in a ticking colored film and forgotten on the side.
This is not what life looks like in reality.
Now we're more exposed, facing the camera naturally, not just a reality show but an authentic documentary series. "
When confronted with their new involvement in the production of the series, which in fact gives them complete control over the content that is received on the screen, Chloe claims: "We are involved behind the scenes, see footage during editing and give comments, but not from a place of protection but simply to give our opinion on what will make the series better.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel like I've had emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they're more of a boundary setter. "
"I have grown up"
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all her might to change her image, from a cheap reality TV crush to a lawyer with an agenda.
"Growing up, I am raising four black children, that is, from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends will have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
That is my motivation. "
"I'm no longer the same Kim who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie to upload," she insists, "but it hasn't completely disappeared from my life either.
A man must be true to who he really is and take it all in stride. "
About the reasons for the dismissal of the producer discovered by Ryan Seacrest and their new and very profitable way in the industry, the meaning of the move to Disney, the family's well-oiled PR machine and its impact on the profitability of the brand and more, in the full article that will be published in "Shishat" magazine.

The international festival in the capital, which has become a tradition and will be held in several locations, will present musical performances by leading local artists, and will combine circus performances and innovative and surprising artistic performances.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The "Next Star" winner finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life •
"The song tells about the way to keep the relationship at a distance," he says.
Tamir Greenberg in a second single called Into the Night after capturing the audience with his first single and his participation in "The Next Star."
In recent months, Greenberg has continued to perform in many venues: The Tel Aviv Culture Hall, the Tel Aviv Opera House, the Shoni Amphitheater, the Yehoshua Gardens Amphitheater, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
The song "Into the Night" was produced and adapted by Greenberg together with producer Autumn Begar.
The video, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to memories of his childhood and the significant presence of his father in his life.
The song is about the relationship between my father and me.
About the time I left the country for the United States and the way to keep the connection at a distance, "says Greenberg.
In the coming month, Greenberg will perform at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and ahead of the new season of "The Next Star," the song with which he won the show, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Made in Blue and White: Jubilee Shamal is the season's big winner and the 16th ninja in the world
The Phenomenon climbed Mount Madurayama in 26 seconds and won the title of "The First Israeli Ninja"
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of ninja.
The
There is a winner: Yuval Shamal conquered Midoriyama, and is the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel" and now holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and the 16th in the world.
Shamal has been participating in the show since its first season then finished in first place, and in the second season lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season, he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be the final season.
This evening, he climbed Mount Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after beating contestants Yugeb Malka and Vichy Klepon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished second.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season only one ninja can be crowned who managed to climb the Midoriyama in time.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, since Yuval, who is full of winners this season, climbed Midoriyama 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the world ninja title.
He will be able to compete on it again next season.
Well, we realized, that full of a superhero, Rotem Sela is perfect, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sports event in the world
.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat in the final of a reality show and acted like it was the most significant sporting achievement on the planet
.
Rotem Sela represents for us a feminine ideal so perfect that it is distorted to present it this way on television.
She earns more on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she is too beautiful, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in place, and when necessary - also to advocate for her business partner.
She is both a mom and a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads reality series and shows, and serves for young girls as an unattainable role model.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Sela goes through a screen that is too perfect, because the show she hosts must be perfect, and there is no need to apologize for that.
In the world of the ninja, everyone is larger than life, and the facilitators first.
Assi Ezer was involved in an affair that was supposed to erase him from the screen for a certain period of time, but because he is not an ordinary human being - he was rescued from it even before the first set of advertisements.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who broadcast European Cup wins and world records in his life, but is excited about the mega-wall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the final, two Olympic medalists (Jordan Jarvi and Linui Ashram) sat alongside him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the conditions for entering the superhuman world that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons.
"Ninja Israel" went out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Midoriyama and a full jubilee who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned a ninja.
There led an almost impassable path, which brought down one by one all the superhuman characters that the show made sure to inflate their egos throughout the year.
Do you want to be a ninja?
Not at our place.
We're looking for superheroes here.
The emphasis was on finding a successor to Shamla, who is called "the king of kings and the only one of his kind," and other nicknames intended to make it clear how perfect and unique he is.
As a result, the difficulty level was raised, the girls who tried to compete in the season's tracks crashed, and the boys competed among themselves for who had more squares in their stomachs and plywood charisma to step into the shoes of the retiring Shamal.
It will be said that this is a sports program that encourages physical activity and shows overcoming difficulties and challenges, but from the point of view of the vast majority of viewers - medium-sized armchair yams like us - "Ninja Israel" cultivates an unattainable sports-achievement model for us.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
As Gil Sessover moves between punchlines and conversations about holiness
It's strange to see the comedian, ex "Comedy Store," host a program "Kabbalah Shabbat" on Channel 14, in which he tastes dishes and gives a platform mainly to men
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question, "What does the term'preparing for Shabbat 'remind you of?"
Say: Spunge and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or my father on TV, but the strangest thing would be if someone suddenly said "Gil Sasover."
Because Gil Sassover in the middle of the sponja and the cooking is the most unrelenting that television can offer.
And really, "Kabbalah Shabbat," the new program he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, is disconnected in spirit from the hour it airs.
For half of it - Sassover is standing.
He speaks quickly, holding a microphone in his hand even as he tastes dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punches and conversations about holiness.
In his defense, it will be said that the paucity of the budget is felt, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was still noticeable in the premiere program, which was broadcast the other day from the Benjamin headquarters, is a clear gender divide.
The men sing, play, dance, speak Torah, market restaurants and factories - while the women settled for a small segment, in which they excitedly talked about running a sewing shop.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Getting Shabbat with Gil Sasover, now 14
The Assisted Living Association Against Ruthie Russo: "To Say'This Has the Taste of Assisted Living 'Hurts Our Activity"
Chairman Yuli Gat sent a letter, in which she expressed the union's complaint against an insulting statement, according to them, of the "Next Restaurant" judge in one of the trailers for the show •
Ruthie Russo in response: "Glad there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population."
The Association of Nursing Homes and Protected Housing in Israel against "The Next Restaurant": In a letter sent by Chairwoman Yuli Gat and reached by Israel Hayom, it reads: "In the pre-broadcast trailer, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said'food has the taste of protected housing, 'that is, the food of a closed institution with low-quality food."
"The tone chosen by the judge of the program, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food that the contestant served immediately cancels our long-standing activity to fight against the ignorance that exists in the field, because the sheltered housing houses operate restaurants in the various houses for the benefit of the tenants with chef dishes of the highest level."
It also states: "The service teams and the managers of the homes are fighting for the image of the sheltered housing that offers solutions for quality housing for the elderly, including alleviating loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living and more."
In Israel in recent years, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most difficult disease in old age and see community places as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of the greatest pleasures in life, so we dedicate resources and efforts to serve our tenants the finest food.
Most assisted living homes are assisted by professional chefs in order to build a menu.
We will be happy at any time to invite the jury to be impressed by the winning dishes served every day to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant teams in the assisted living homes, we ask for your apologies and clarification.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly. "
Ruthie Russo said in response: "I am glad that there are places that invest more in the cuisine of this population, which definitely deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, sane people and chefs everywhere, even in assisted living. "
"Double moral: In Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't cancel?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer addressed the criticism hurled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double morality •
"The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"
Earlier this week, Nick Cave canceled a concert in Russia due to the war and declared that he "stands by Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon."
In doing so, the acclaimed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who have also cancelled gigs in the invaded country.
But in Kyiv's case his cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet slammed the singer as a hypocrite, as in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two concerts held in Israel, despite much criticism from pro-Palestinian organizations.
"In the end, I am here for two reasons: The first reason is because I love Israel and Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."
The same Akhmet well remembered Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even published on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files," a scathing post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying state, and therefore the situation of Palestine is the same as that of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your message about Ukraine," Ahmet wrote, "is that you did not support the Palestinians, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost responsible for the Palestinian suffering.
It makes me very sad, because you represent a double standard here, "the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story does not end here, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he stressed that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is an assault without prior provocation by one country on its neighbour, in the hope of changing the security order of Europe as a whole.
The second situation is complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts are indeed similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I have great sympathy for all of these communities - no matter where they are or who they are. "
Kiev added that while he is not interested in elaborating on his views regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supports the Palestinians as well, noting that over the past 20 years he has participated in many fundraising events for them.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Akhmet," the singer clarified, "this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently experiencing a catastrophe on their land.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them, I would. "
In light of the decline in morbidity: The Corona Projector will return to manage Ziv Hospital
Prof. Salman Zarqa was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the corona treatment policy in the third wave and the fourth wave •
At the request of the Minister of Health Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue at the same time in his role as a projector •
Prof. Zarka: "Happy that the Omicron wave continues to wane, and it is still our duty to prepare for another wave"
.
Against the background of the decline in the incidence of coronavirus, the corona projector, Prof. Salman Zarka, will return to manage the Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue at the same time in his role as a projector.
"I am happy for the sake of the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to wane and that we have received our normal way of life back," Prof. Zarka said, adding: "It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a result of the fact that the virus is still here, in Israel and around the world."
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the post in July 2021 and led the corona treatment policy in the third wave and the fourth wave.
As of May 1, Israel returned to a state of "between waves," which includes reducing most of the corona arrays, while maintaining the capabilities to conduct sequencing tests and investigations, which will form the basis for action in the event that a new variant is discovered.
A latent morbidity
In the report of the National Knowledge and Information Center for the Corona Campaign, published this morning, it was noted that "there is a decrease in the average of new verified cases to below two thousand per day, on a weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients and those hospitalized in serious condition."
However, they stressed that "there is latent morbidity on a significant scale and in practice the number of infected is much higher.
The number of institutional tests carried out in the community (without considering the tests of returnees from abroad, MI) is low, and stands at less than 20,000 tests on a weekly average only.
The low volume of tests makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends. "
The State Comptroller's Report: The Actual Budget in Most Years of the Drug Basket Committee's Activity - Less Than the Recommended Budget
According to Netanyahu Engelman's report, for more than 20 years of the basket's activity - the Ministry of Health did not supervise the committee's activities •
The report also states that the minutes of the sittings are published significantly late, if at all •
In addition, the auditor recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activities - and updating the basket work procedures •
Another defect that was found concerns the fact that since the committee began its activities, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the extent of use and utilization of the drugs in the basket - which would have made it possible to analyze and audit the budget given to them.
The Medicines Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the health funds - but a new report by the State Comptroller published on Tuesday warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without control reports on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervising and examining its activities.
"Israel Hayom" correspondent Ran Resnik adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing disclosures in "Israel Hayom" about the omissions in the drug basket.
According to Netanyahu Engelman's report, he recommends "making corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will lead to a better utilization of the health care basket budget that the public is entitled to."
Throughout the years of the existence of the addition mechanism to the basket of medicines, in the years 1998-2021, medicines totaling eight billion shekels were added to the state budget - with the addition ranging annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the health care basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated for expanding the basket was smaller than the volume of requests.
In most of the years of the committee's operation (90% of the time), the amount of the budget supplement was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.
The auditor notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual increment in order to allow certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that "the transparency model in the basket work is lacking."
Thus, for example, the procedure for the work of the basket committee states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 160-109 days, when sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in the publication of the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; as a result, the ability of the proposers - patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies - to submit repeated applications as soon as possible and relevant, after they have learned from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and amended their proposals and reassessed their feasibility for acceptance in the next round, may be impaired," the auditor noted in the report.
"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules established in the procedure."
Out of thousands of submissions - only one financial note was submitted
Another criticism by Engelman concerns the preliminary procedure of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The auditor found that about half (46%) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.
Another deficiency concerns the activities of the drug basket subcommittee, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The auditor recommends that a public representative be attached or that the possibility be explored of publishing the discussions to the public without confidential commercial details.
The procedure according to which the Health Services Basket Committee operates states that "an economic assessment must be submitted" for an application to add a medicine to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions - and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, for the 2021-2019 basket committee hearings, applications were submitted to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report showed that the requests were not accompanied by economic estimates, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing the damage of diseases caused by obesity or due to the ability to avoid gastric surgery.
It also shows that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
For example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparation for the treatment of an increase in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The Comptroller also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the HMOs, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health (the "Third Supplement"), have also been included in the basket of medicines.
This is when the legal framework for this step is regulated only retrospectively.
In the last six years, NIS 74 million of the addition to the drug basket has been used for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as "drugs without additional cost," the use of which does not cost the health funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The auditor suggests examining the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and shortened route, so that the basket of drugs can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no oversight of the use of extremely expensive drugs.
The audit also shows that since the work of the basket committee began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds to report and has not monitored the extent of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports have been published that refer to the years 2006-2009, and these were also published with considerable delay (the last one was published this year and dealt with the utilization of the budget in 2007-2009).
"The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, the irrelevance of the conclusions emerging from the test after such a long period of time, the subcommittee's non-optimal pricing and decision-making based on inconclusive findings," the report said.
The ministry also does not audit and monitor the use of extremely expensive drugs and has not learned any lessons.
These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2021-2016).
On this, the auditor wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use compared to the estimates.
Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the sub-committee, and about how to prepare estimates when pricing drugs and technologies and improve them. "
"Shocking and unimaginable": Heated health committee hearing on the poisoning at Daphne House
The indicators of the first deceased Jose were normal ten minutes before her death •
The chairman of the committee, MK Silman: "If the people there cared that the kitchen would be like at home - it wouldn't look like this."
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old Jose from the "Beit Dafna" daycare center in Holon died of food poisoning, she was taken medical measures that were normal, the director of the daycare center claimed Tuesday at a hearing of the health committee.
'we have night carers who check in during the night and there's a nurse who does rounds.
There have been a number of reports of cases of diarrhoea and the same tenant basically last time she had measures taken was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was monitored like the rest of the dykers with diarrhea.
She is a long-term care patient, we went to get a crane to assist with her transfer and then that tenant did not respond.
We started CPR and called the clinic nurse, "the director of the residence described what happened last Sunday morning in the residence.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized and in total about a quarter of the residents of the residence (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea from eating contaminated raw meat.
The director of the daycare center said this against the background of claims that a death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Nus, responsible for epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, noted that "we cannot determine unequivocally what the three occupants died of.
Only blood tests were taken. "
It also emerged at the hearing that even from the occupants who were admitted to the hospital it was no longer possible to take a stool sample because they had not coughed and therefore it is not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
An engineer from the Ministry of Health also noted that "the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary condition of kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs or at the request of a license renewal."
The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that a commission of inquiry has not yet been appointed for this case and for a previous case of abuse of children that took place three months ago at the Bnei Zion institution in the Sharon.
The chairman of the health committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the hearing: "If people there cared that the kitchen would be like at home - it wouldn't look like this.
The welfare dorm-dwellers need more.
They are sensitive to health and need extra care and care.
It's shocking and unbelievable what happened there.
The terrible findings that were discovered are even after they knew that the Ministry of Health had come to check.
Where is the oversight and accountability of the offices?
How is it that ministers and heads of ministries are not present at such a discussion to give an explanation of what is happening here? "
Yigal Nachtomi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who manages the daycare center and even ran the daycare center himself, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire system rise up with only one goal: To do good to people.
The people who died were people I personally cared for.
I put one of the girls to sleep on my hands.
This is a shocking event for us. "
Smadar Ona, a former resident of a residence the same age as her, lashed out at him, saying, "Enough of the lies and beautiful words.
I was there. "
Gali Barmi, representative of the parents at Akim Israel: "We have complained about the food in the past and did not receive the criticism."
Oren Hellman, founder of the Equal Chance Initiative for the Integration of People with Disabilities, protested that the names of the deceased were not published: "Their names are not known at all.
Are they worth less?
We are wasting our children's lives. "
Suspected omission in Wolfson: The surgeon caused a rupture in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akar as director of the thoracic surgery unit at the hospital •
The chairman of the doctors' committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, had been warned before his appointment.
Hospital: "He is well-respected and experienced"
A horrific mistake occurred at the Wolfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during an operation the doctor ruptured the patient's heart, leading to his tragic death.
The surgery on the 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19.
It was the first surgery performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akar at the hospital, after he was appointed director of the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, which was designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large rupture in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.
But the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised difficult questions regarding the management of the hospital.
The director of the oncology institute and chairman of the doctors' committee, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation of the affair in a letter he sent to the hospital's director, Dr. Anat Engel.
The letter raised extremely serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
A huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient was lucid, functioning and had been treated by him for the past four years.
Recently, he had a spread of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid was discovered inside the pericardium, in which the heart muscle is located.
Also, the surgeon Dr. Abu Akar, was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, there was a serious malfunction in the surgery, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of the department of cardiac and thoracic surgery at Wolfson, who was at the same time in the surgery of a child in the next room, "was called in a hurry to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."
According to him, the heart was drained of blood, blood pressures were zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar was not professionally and personally suitable to manage the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and even though he was supposed to be the direct manager of the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without sharing it and accepted Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
He also noted: "This is an uncomplicated procedure, which takes a few minutes," and added: "It is impossible not to address the poor process of accepting Dr. Abu Akar to the position.
The question arises whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the operation and the death of the patient. "
As an experienced surgeon
Israel Hayom received information and allegations from other senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised by Dr. Ronen Brenner in the case.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of Surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is "one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young chest surgeon."
He also added that he was selected in a proper tender and Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements about his desire to "disconnect" from the chest unit.
He added: "I was not a party to the procedure either, and it is possible that I should have been.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Faras Abu Akar began working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace, "All the doctors at the hospital were impressed by his professionalism and motivation and willingness to work.
He has already carried out dozens of cases of a similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it did in an unfortunate way.
Wolfson Hospital said in a statement: "We share in the family's grief.
This is a patient of the oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The thoracic surgeon mentioned in the article is an esteemed surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in a tender to manage the thoracic surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, his quoted words are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very serious condition.
The hospital checks the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health knows the details of the case. "

A model for healing: Three senior doctors tell of their mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, especially during the pandemic •
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh does not forget, even from the height of his position, the push from the late Prof. Shaul Soknik •
And Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev thanks Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld for the lesson in identifying with patients •
Three key people in the hospitals write about those who inspired them and encouraged them to be better, both as caregivers and as human beings.
Three senior doctors, three teachers of life and the profession: On the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, Israel Hayom invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to recall the figures who accompanied them at the beginning - and helped them become who they are today.
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba <unk>
About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira
The meeting that opened my eyes - and changed my life
Had I not met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the infectious diseases unit at Hadassah Hospital, I would probably have remained a specialist in internal medicine.
He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to engage in it.
I met him in the hallways of Hadassah, sometime in the 1980s.
For a moment I did not think that I would leave the internal, because I loved the treatment of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, also in the internal, and in fact in every area.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
Throughout, I loved his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved the sick and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.
He was a genuine and honest man, devoid of ego, qualities I liked very much about him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me most of all, I was going to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapiro.
Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day - for example, "tishu iz de ishio," meaning that taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ allows you to know which drugs should be given; or "wen yu yuz it, yu luz it," which is meant to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physical therapist who worked in Hadassah and had two daughters.
He died about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven, I cried.
He was something - a witty, smart epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even when he was sick.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to handle pandemics, and he is sorely missed during this time.
Had he been with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted with him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the team to handle epidemics.

About Prof. Shaul Soknik
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
.
I first met the late Prof. Shaul Soknik when I was a student in the fourth year of medical studies, and I came to a round in internal medicine in the Department of Internal Medicine D, which he managed.
Later, I returned to the department also in the sixth year, and I did the final thesis of the medical school under his guidance, writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).
Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life over the course of 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; not only professionally, but also - and above all - personally and humanly.
During the internship, I debated between family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about the choice of specialization.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.
During the internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways - in scientific writing (sorry Shaul, I didn't persevere enough), in contact with patients, working in a multi-professional team - an area in which the department excelled - and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from borrowing.
When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go for a period of study abroad, Shaul pushed and guided me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.
The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and encouragement I'm not sure it would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital management, Shaul was again the one who supported and helped.
We later managed complex periods together in the internal medicine division.
Shaul knew how to combine the teacher, the manager, the friend and the team partner in a wonderful way, without his different roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to be as successful as him in this special combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns, who are now throughout the medical system in Israel, and perpetuate his memory and work with their excellent work.
I am honored to be with this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of the Schneider Pediatrics Center
About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at Schneider Children's, taught me how to be an intensive care physician, but more than that - he taught me how to think.
The most obvious thing I've learned from him is to take care of the most complex, sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, and are now between life and death.
The obvious one is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who did not imagine that they would be caught up in these complex situations in an intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but it's the obvious.
But I learned even more profound and profound things from him.
Looking back, since I am a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, it is clear to me today the connection between the worlds; the education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: To listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurses, to the young and old caregivers, and to listen to the parents.
All this should be done not only to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in child care exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and conversation inspire a deeper understanding, both on the part of the treating team and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at a whole system.
The deeper and more rigorous the understanding, which incorporates all the factors involved, the more accurate the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and above all - early enough to prevent future damage, immediate or distant.
That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He is a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, to listen - and then to apply.

Medical malpractice at different stages of birth
In order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence.
Birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family's life.
However, unfortunately, sometimes births end in serious damage caused to the mother or newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where the birth ended in physical injury to the newborn or the mother, there is room to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in the field of medical negligence will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff at the various stages of the birth that caused the damage and, as he sees fit, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment by the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.
When, then, is it negligence?
When the doctor's mistake was due to a lack of skill or deviated from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the acceptable level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.
In this article, we will examine the different stages of birth, explain what are the complications that may occur at each stage and when they rise to medical negligence.
The phase of contractions
The phase of contractions lasts on average from 8 to 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (in order to allow the passage of the fetus at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about 10 centimeters.
Most of the cases of medical malpractice during the labor phase involve the failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes resulting in cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy may be caused by a failure to identify or a delay in identifying a perinatal asphyxiation, which manifests itself in a failure to supply oxygen to the brain tissue of the fetus.
As a general rule, monitoring the condition of the mother and correct interpretation of the monitor that tracks fetal cardiac activity should lead to early identification of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreparably damaged.
Cases in which the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or the team does not correctly interpret the data in front of it and in particular the fetal monitor or reacts late to the distress expressed on the monitor - may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a prolapse of the umbilical cord as well as a rupture in the uterus that was not detected in a timely manner.
Even in these difficult situations, it is important to find out whether the medical team acted properly.
For example, attorney Anna Reif Liganza, from the firm of Caspi Sror & Co., which specializes in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her firm handled a lawsuit of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the head of the fetus was too high, thereby causing the umbilical cord to drop (when the umbilical cord precedes the head of the fetus) and damage the oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and giving birth to a serious neurological injury.
In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to serious medical negligence by the staff of the maternity department in a large hospital who, during the birth, did not identify clear signs that required a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of her previous pregnancy.
The fetus that was ejected through the rupture in its mother's uterus into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
It should be emphasized that in order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal link between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the infant and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused by such negligence and not by any other reason or factor.
The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out by examining medical indicators that, according to the medical literature, only in their existence there is a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.
Among other things, the indicators of the level of acidity in the blood of the fetus, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic injury, and more are examined.
The passing of the fetus
The Active Birth Stage
The active birth stage begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Delayed birth and avoiding caesarean section
In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, that is, a lack of progress of the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.
"There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner can cause irreversible damage to the fetus," explained Attorney Reif-Liganza.
"For example, we managed a medical malpractice claim for the death of a newborn caused by a significant delay in performing a caesarean section.
Unlike any recognized medical practice, the medical staff was not able to recognize the fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the surgery caused systemic damage to the newborn, which ultimately led to her death shortly after her birth. "
Negligence in vacuum birth
In situations where the mother or fetus is exposed to a significant danger that requires an especially rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.
In this process, a "dome" is attached to the head of the fetus using a vacuum and the fetus is pulled out by force.
Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great caution, accuracy and skill.
In these cases, medical negligence may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory instructions and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the head of the fetus is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for a longer time than allowed or when, despite the failure of several attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more than the allowed number of attempts.
In these cases, if the careless operation of the vacuum caused damage to the newborn - among other things, it can cause cranial damage and bleeding that can cause the development of brain damage - there is room for filing a tort claim.
Paralysis named after Erb
Paralysis named after Arv, here is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is worth checking whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric staff.
The injury manifests itself in the weakness of the hand muscles and can reach complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a "shoulder dislocation" - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus's shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.
When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the assessment of the weight of the fetus indicated that it was a macrosomal fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kilograms and in accordance with the guidelines it is preferable to give birth to the mother by cesarean section.
When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a cesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.
In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder dislocation and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.
Indeed, in CA 2694 / 90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance to one degree or another of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a fear of its occurrence, is to conduct a cesarean section."
The placenta exit stage
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the exit of the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process lasts in most cases up to half an hour from the moment the baby comes out and often occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.
After the placenta comes out, the medical team will check whether it came out in its entirety or whether there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.
During this stage, complications may occur that can cause serious damage to the mother.
One of the well-known complications resulting from the formation of placental residues in the uterus is called "Asherman's syndrome," the scarring of the uterine wall is the result of inflammation caused by the formation of placental residues in the uterus, a phenomenon that affects the endometrium in a way that does not allow the implantation of pregnancy.
Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not recognize that there were placental residues or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the endometrium despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, this may be medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
The passing of the birthmother
Death during childbirth is very rare.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or reacts late to such bleeding.
"For example," Attorney Reif-Liganza told us, "our office filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a woman giving birth, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the alarming vital signs of the woman giving birth, for long hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the underlying disease from which she suffered."
"In another case," said Attorney Reif-Liganza, "our office represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated from a cesarean section that was not sutured properly.
In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, reacting late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death. "
Loss of a uterus
In severe cases, medical negligence at birth can lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Rafe Lingza: "Our office filed a lawsuit against a hospital based on a hysterectomy due to medical negligence after birth.
In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical team after the birth, and yet no actions were taken at the time that could have prevented the damage. "
What are the damages awarded in claims for medical malpractice at birth?
Newborn compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being provided for pain and suffering, nursing and care wages, wage and pension losses to the victim and even to his parents and other damage components.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.
The compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adapting housing to the baby's needs, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined on a case-by-case basis and according to the circumstances," says Attorney Reif-Liganza, and she adds and notes that "today, most claims on the grounds of medical negligence end in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in conducting the procedure," but the attorney added and said that "there are cases in which the procedure ends only with a judgment, then if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and, for example, in a lawsuit conducted by our office, the district court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation in excess of ten million shekels."
To sum up
Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by a lawyer skilled in managing claims on the grounds of medical negligence, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of keratoconus eye disease in the South
A study has shown that there is a link between the development of the disease and close marriages •
The highest incidence was found in the Bedouin sector •
Expert: "It is possible that in any sector with a lot of weddings between cousins, we will find a high incidence of the disease."
Keratoconus is a hereditary eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and find the right solutions to prevent the situation from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted to help understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide a scientific basis for the suspicion that keratoconus eye disease is a genetic disease.
A recent study, which dealt with the transformation of the shape of the cornea from a dome to a cone, revealed that the cause of the disease and the weakness of the cornea and its deformation is related to an enzyme imbalance, following which the free radicals can damage the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The source of that enzyme deficiency is genetic, a fact that reinforces the hypothesis that keratoconus is an inherited disease.
According to Prof. Ariela Gordon-Shag, head of the Department of Optometric Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, "In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of keratoconus of 3.2% was found.
The highest incidence was among students from the Bedouin sector - 20% had keratoconus, but there was a small relative sample. "
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: "There is a large prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that close marriages are a risk factor for keratoconus disease.
So in any sector with a lot of weddings between cousins, we may find a high incidence. "
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: In cases where a family history of keratoconus disease appears, all family members should access an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.
According to Arza Fruchter, a B.Sc clinical optometrist, "there is a tenfold appeal to the clinic from remote periphery areas, mainly from the southern region, compared to the center."
"Over the past decade, I have noticed that most patients are turning away from the periphery, especially from the Be'er Sheva area.
This is mainly due to the high incidence of marriages within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of proper treatment of the problem. "
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or in the late teens (ages 16-15 or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, coinciding with an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients have distorted and / or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease may also develop at a rapid rate and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many patients also show increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza - the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: "Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel"
Mahmoud Khair a-Din from the village of Khorfish is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in the operation in Khan Younis •
The head of AMN: "The publication deserves him, his family and his children"
Later, the possibility of publishing the photo of Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from the Chief of Staff's patrol will be examined.
About three and a half years after the operation that involved Khan Younis, the IDF today permits publication that the person killed in the operation, Lt. Col. M., is the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair al-Din from the village of Khorfish in the north.
The 41-year-old was in his infancy.
"It has been three and a half years since the late Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Kheir al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the state.
"The late Mahmoud was a soldier in a paratrooper patrol and later grew up in the army to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's special operations unit.
A hero of Israel who was decorated after his death with the "Chief of Staff."
"I paid tribute to him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and the face of the hero of Israel, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Kheir al-Din, openly.
The environment bore its eyes to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the intelligence division, Major General Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, a hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977, in the village of Khorfish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmed and Nazira, and seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahad and had two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the special operations unit of the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Kheir a-Din was a social leader, and the environment bore its eyes on him.
Until the ninth grade he attended school in the village of Horfish, and then moved to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997 he enlisted in a paratrooper patrol, and in 2000 he graduated from the officers' school.
In 2002, he was spotted by the special operations unit in the AMN and moved to serve there.
While serving, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002 he met his wife, Nahad, and in 2004 they were married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the "Aharei" association and began to guide a group in the village of Horfish, after making sure that the association began to operate in the Druze villages to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
The head of the AMN, Major General Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "It's time we turn to the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Kheir al-Din, the hero of Israel.
We finished work and came to the conclusion that there is no security obstacle to publishing his name and picture.
It's also for him, his family and his children, "he said.
"An exceptional educator and leader"
"Thanks to many promotions, he is nothing short of a hero in my eyes," said Major General Haliva.
"He has a significant contribution, with courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He deserves the right place. "
And he added: "I didn't know him personally, but he was an exceptional educator, educator and leader - not only on the operational side, but also in my values."
Major General Haliva noted that he would later also examine whether to publish the picture of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose picture was not allowed to be published.
The action in Khan Younis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of careful preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
In the command squad of the operation sat the then Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot, the then Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heyman and the then head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been allowed to be published, and the IDF stressed that this is an operation whose intelligence value is invaluable.
But the Arab media retrospectively presented communications equipment that the Palestinians said had been left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was aimed at planting listening devices.
According to publications, on the day of the incident, the trooper was traveling in two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas operatives, and something in their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The on-the-ground investigation took about 45 minutes, during which it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair al-Din managed to distract the Hamas men, and in a split second the commander of the force, Lt. Col. A, was able to open fire.
The fire killed three Hamas members, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.
Ten months after the difficult incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the Salvation Army Committee and award the Chief of Staff's Salute to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip - among them the late Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.
The commander of the fighting force and another fighter in the team also received a salute.
The army said in a statement at the time that Lt. Col. M. received the medal for "his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, in defense of his comrades.
Later, he acted out of initiative and striving for contact, took a leading role in taking over the enemy and worked resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider switching from tweezers to an extensive operation
Israel should ask itself, once again, whether it is wrong to change its policy towards the Jenin sector.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank in its wake, but the Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
The tumultuous weekend we went through shows that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the territory is still more explosive than ever.
It will take a lot of effort and common sense to safely cross the two upcoming memorial dates: Nakba Day, which began today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day, which will be celebrated in two weeks.
Quite a few factors will oppose in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
At their head, as always, are the terrorist elements, who are concentrating a special effort on trying to preserve the violent atmosphere of the past few weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which a HIMM fighter, the late Maj. Noam Raz, was killed the other day.
Fighters who took part in the battle in Jenin testified that they do not remember such a scale of shooting and violence - evidence not only of the huge amount of weapons on the ground, but also of the willingness to use them.
This requires Israel to ask itself, once again, if it is wrong to change policy vis-à-vis the Jenin sector, and move from small, intelligence-based tweezers operations to a large, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena; even now, the security establishment prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid incendiary attacks, but the Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
Draw lessons for future events.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims to have deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and for those who are present on the scene.
The IDF takes enormous risks for its forces in order to avoid harming innocents as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of fighters.
This indicates high morality, but it also has operational-intelligence value: A terrorist caught alive - as happened the other day in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about weapons, attacks and other terrorists; this is information that usually cannot be obtained in any other way, and through which it is possible to thwart subsequent attacks.
The IDF acted correctly when it published the interim investigation it conducted in the case of Abu Aqleh's death, and made it clear that it is not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful that it will be possible to reach an unambiguous bottom line in the affair.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the convinced: The world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terrorism - the original pretext for which the IDF constantly acts in Jenin.
As ever, it is the nature of such stories to die out.
World public opinion is preoccupied with its own and moving on, certainly as a much more intense war continues to rage in Ukraine.
Therefore, it is a pity that Israel insisted on giving the case of Abu Aqleh's death more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu Aqleh's family did not live up to the early estimates, one should have expected a little more panic from the police officers who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less excitement from the Palestinian flags that were flown there.
The responsibility is binding: To act to calm the situation.
The Minister of Internal Security and the Police Commissioner did well to order an investigation into the incident.
It seems that he lacked sufficient preparation and clear guidelines, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
In the Dizengoff attack, too, the police failed in managing the incident, isolating the scene and handling the media.
The investigative committee would do well if it did not just analyze the conduct of the police officers at the funeral itself, but also draw lessons and conclusions that will allow for a more successful handling of similar incidents in the future.
Alongside the internal handling of the police, it also undertakes to give consideration to the conduct of elected officials who have lost their way and direction.
The Israeli Knesset currently has several members who appear to be a danger to democracy.
They are on the left and the right, and they use their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kassif is the latest example of this; if no steps are taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the state will implicitly encourage the next elected official to further radicalize his actions.
Such moves, which are in the sense of a defensive democracy, are essential in the explosiveness of this period, with elements in the background seeking to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with common sense is expected to rise above all of this, and act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel could quickly slide into escalation against external enemies, and worse - against domestic rivals.
A senior police official: "Government policy and setting goals are required here"
The Israeli police have launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal residents, but the road is still long.
There is no single factor in the State of Israel today that encompasses this entire issue. "
"If we want to address the phenomenon of illegal residents, a government policy is required, and from it we must derive goals, tasks and responsibilities.
Today, there is no single entity in the State of Israel that encompasses this entire issue, "a senior police official told Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon manifested itself in about 20,000 to 30,000 shekels entering every day through the loopholes in the fence.
In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day to work through 34 controlled crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each industry is limited by a quota determined by the political echelon in accordance with the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, Sheba is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to terrorist attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permitted quota of permits.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were considered Shin Bet, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security officials to monitor their movements.
"Therefore, there is no meaning to their entry through the loopholes in the fence," says a senior security official, "Whoever wants to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled crossings, and there have already been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of numerous warnings of attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal residents.
By the end of the week, about 16,000 Shabbos had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases were opened against them, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the police prosecution policy, proceedings against an illegal stayer are carried out only against prone criminals or people who repeat the act repeatedly (recidivists).
An illegal resident arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes this is repeated a second time, but only the third time he is arrested, imprisoned and indicted for illegal stay.
According to the law, if an illegal stayer is caught within a range of about 50 to 100 meters on each side of the separation fence, his treatment is carried out by the military prosecution.
Data obtained by "Israel Hayom" shows that in 2021, 40,010 illegal staycationers, instigators and instigators were dealt with by the police.
7,405 illegal residents were arrested and a criminal case was opened against 19,533.
The number of employers, conveyancers and invigilators dealt with by police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
"The foundations of the Shin Bet phenomenon do not depend on the police, not on the IDF, not on Israeli society and not on Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors, "says a senior law enforcement official.
"In order to address this phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be sterilized, and the Israeli side must charge them a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the matter claim that the failure to collect the price is due, among other things, to a lack of places of confinement and the fact that the arrests are made only when there are related offenses or it is a recidivist.
Legal sources claim that the decision to charge a fee only starting with his third arrest was made, among other things, because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests carried out every day.
Anyone who examines the punishment will find that it is not a deterrent. "
There is a great complexity
Sheba, "says a police source," is a complex person. "
He can be a father of a family who entered the country to work to earn a few shekels and return.
This is the basic platform, and on it are dressed many types of prisoners who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks. "
It can be adult or minor.
In the past, 16-year-old illegal residents have been caught by the police, and even 8- and 10-year-olds are sent by their parents to road junctions to earn a few shekels a day from driving.
"It also makes the matter complicated, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and file an indictment against them for neglect," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed IPS in garbage disposal, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 crossings, there are about 18 major crossings.
There are crossings of vehicles and goods, there are crossings through which only people pass, and there are crossings that are both.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the crossings authority.
The Shin Bet are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as it is easy money.
"There are those who do this for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is transporting prisoners," says a senior police official, "usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can go from $100 to $300 per person.
Registered companies do not do this, because if the company is caught, it is doomed to close. "
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting a prisoner of war can be considered a felony.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who collects Palestinians at orderly points and at regular hours, including an orderly order, does not break the law," says a senior police official.
For the most part, these guys drive a car from Chokmak because they know that their car is being snorted, so they prefer to drive an old car. "

"We need to open a criminal investigation against her": Haifa City Comptroller on serious accusations against Einat Kalish Rotem
The city comptroller's report presents alleged concerns about criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former city officials and political rivals: Surveillance of employees and inflated payment to an accounting firm for conducting investigations •
"The serious findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation."
No comment was provided from the Haifa municipality.
Surveillance of municipal employees and political opponents and an inflated payment to an accounting firm for conducting investigations, "at the expense of the public purse."
The report of Haifa City Comptroller Ofer Tal, published on Tuesday, presents an alleged concern about criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality, municipal employees, and political rivals.
Allegedly, Kalish met with the accounting firm Barlev & Co. and asked to conduct an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under the names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to Councilwoman Sophie Nakash, and it was examined whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash's family are kosher for mehadrin.
The auditor's report also shows that there is disorder and a complete lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to coordinate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant were not transferred to him.
This has meant that no one in the municipality is aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what the scope of work required in each of them is.
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not confirmed in many cases as required.
A situation was created in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved grew disproportionately, with great interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring by the municipality.
In its summary of the report, the audit recommended stopping the unpaid payments to the accountant, until material detailing his work on each of the issues it examined is received.
On top of that, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were under codes such as "gatekeepers," information shop, fish shop, investigative audit to the mayor and procurement investigative audit report.
Shortly after, the city's attorney, Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor herself signed the payment approval in her place.
"It was not commissioned by any audit report and I am not aware of what it was about," she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remained to be paid, from the tax funds of the Haifa public.
The city's former treasurer, Jackie Vakim, responded: "These vile actions were done to tarnish my name and the names of elected officials at the expense of the public coffers and the Haifa tax payer, and this is a criminal offense."
City Councilwoman Sophie Nakash in her response: "The auditor's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves."
Lawyer Sarit Golan, a member of the Haifa City Council, responded: "The evidence and the difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the use of the investigative audit consultant to conduct investigations, some of which are doubtful as to whether they are permitted by law in the manner in which they were carried out, and in particular the investigations concerning the council member from the opposition to the mayor and former senior employees."
Lior Datz's response: "It seems that all the red lines have been crossed that a public authority sends investigators to gather information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption and while the association conducts public proceedings against the administration of the Haifa municipality."
The Haifa municipality did not provide a comment.
The firm of accountant Yehuda Barlev does not wish to comment.
Gantz revealed: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm the activities of UNIFIL in Lebanon"
The defense minister attended the international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation."
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of al-Sayed in Hamas captivity: "A video aimed at extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue."
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke Wednesday morning at the International Cyber Conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University, where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to hit UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country," Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hisham al-Sayed, the prisoner of Hamas in Gaza, who was released by the military wing of the terrorist organization: "Yesterday, a video was published aimed at extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four boys captive in violation of international law, in violation of morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal conduct of Hamas. "
"The State of Israel is acting in a variety of ways, and continues to turn over every stone in order to bring the boys home.
As we have said before - this is a humanitarian issue, this is how we see it, and on this basis we will continue to act.
Attempts at blackmail and mind exercises will not affect our position and conduct. "
He later revealed joint activity by Iran and Hezbollah: "Iran also operates its affiliates in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recently activity was detected by Iranian security agencies in cooperation with Hezbollah, in order to harm the activities of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This was done by carrying out a cyber operation whose purpose was to steal materials on UNIFIL's deployment in the area, and use them by Hezbollah.
This is another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon, and on the stability of Lebanon. "
"Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation.
In recent years, we have seen a phenomenon of hacker groups on behalf of Iran, which operate against Israel and other countries, "Gantz said.
"The'new couriers' are terrorists with a keyboard who are sentenced like the fighters of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we harm them and their senders, and even today they are in our sights - and not only in the cyber dimension.
No attack against the citizens of Israel will be on the agenda.
And the responsibility is on the attackers and the state that funds and sends them.
A cyber attack can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and other spaces. "
Gantz continued his attack on the nuclear power: "Iran leads cyber terrorism - and makes moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the United States presidential election and in other attempts that Israel is aware of.
"Actions such as that of the Shahid Kawah unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under the direct directive of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in the investigations."
"In recent years, we have thwarted many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand'cyber responsibility 'and to punish companies and entities that do not act in accordance with the guidelines. "
Gantz went on to outline Israel's next goals in the face of the threats: "Our supreme task, in the army, in the industries and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have placed this issue as one of the central tasks in the relevant units.
We are constantly examining the building of the force - both in terms of personnel, both in terms of training and in terms of tasks.
In the coming years, we will also have to examine the form of organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system. "
Finally, the Minister of Defense concluded and called for cooperation with the world: "There is great importance to our cooperation with the world against Iran also in the cyber dimension.
The same cooperation that we are building in the region against Iran in aspects of defense against various threats - we are also expanding in the cyber dimension. "
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems."
Uri, deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit's first public appearance at such conferences, revealed that Israel had thwarted an attack on the water systems.
"Cyber security is a core part of our business.
Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and act to negate his abilities, "said the deputy commander of 8200, adding," So sometimes we also find victims outside of Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and by collaborating with industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed. "
"We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them several years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a certain adversary attacked Israel and in the process we identified that the same attacker also tried to target power plants in the US.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We managed to prevent this threat through close cooperation with our American partners. "
Watch: This is how the police prepare to eliminate terrorists in the civilian population
The Jerusalem Border Police inaugurates a new "Assaf" facility that simulates shooting in a crowded crowd in response to the series of attacks that have occurred in recent months •
The Border Police's counter-terrorism guide envelops Jerusalem: "The development provides a relevant response to the attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground" •
A glimpse of the "Assaf" facility
Preparing for the next attack: A series of terrorist attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, during which 19 people were killed and about 70 civilians were injured, led the Border Guard to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to attack terrorists in a civilian population and shoot at traffic.
"Israel Hayom" unveiling: A glimpse of the "Assaf" installation
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary to lead a normal life of a civilian population.
The severe wave of attacks that took place this year, with attacks in Be'er Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who assimilated into the crowd, led the police to think creatively in order to develop a tool that could be used to train fighters to attack terrorists within a civilian population.
The thinking was led by the training division of the police and the border guard.
These came out in a competition in the various police districts under the title "Commanders Lead Learning," in which each district was required to develop measures that would help improve the policing and combat skills of the fighters, police officers and commanders.
As part of the competition, and as a response to the need to train Border Police fighters for combat training in shooting in motion and in such descriptions, Assaf Ben David, a counter-terrorism instructor of the Jerusalem Border Police, developed the "Assaf facility," which consists of a dynamic target, which is connected to a telescopic pole on which a carrier can be harnessed to the instructor.
Their servant who guides the carrier to his death, he can practice the warrior standing in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Guard fighters have faced many attacks in which the assailant, carries out gunfire and poses a threat while on the move in arenas saturated with innocent civilians.
The "Assaf facility," in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic pole that was upgraded and integrated into the facility was taken from the maintenance and cleaning area.
Using the facility, it is possible to simulate shooting in motion within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling a traffic stop, choosing a path of progress and performing selective shooting, including the practice of preventing injury to the uninvolved.
Major Assaf Ben David, after whom the facility is named, says: "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in the learning and training of soldiers and police officers.
The development provides a relevant response to the threats of attribution and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of development compared to the relatively cheap cost of production gives us a significant competitive advantage. "
The State Comptroller warns: "The Central Election Commission is not prepared for cyber threats"
Netanyahu Engelman Warns of Israel's Lack of Preparedness for Cyber Attacks
"World War III will be a hacker war, but the world is not prepared for it."
State Comptroller Netanyahu Engelman on Wednesday attended Tel Aviv University's annual cyber conference and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
'we are being exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our kids are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it. "
Engelman said that as part of the cyber audits that his firm conducts, significant deficiencies were found: "Over the past year, we carried out penetration tests at the traffic management center in Jerusalem, in hospitals and in the systems of the Tax Authority.
In the audits, we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were carried out by public bodies and some conducted penetration tests only during the audit.
In addition, there were deficiencies in the Central Election Commission's preparedness for cyber threats. "
"We at the State Comptroller's Office undertake to continue to address this significant issue more forcefully, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world," he concluded.
Aiming high: "I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles"
The choice of the Reds: "From the first moment they showed me that they wanted me, I am built to lead a big team" •
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: "I felt I had a place, I want to be in the squad for EuroBasket" •
And the time at Maccabi Tel Aviv: "I learned to concentrate only on what I can control" •
Oz blazers in an interview.
Oz Blazer will leave today with the players of the Israeli national team for Poland, where they will meet the local team in the 2023 World Championship qualifiers (Thursday, 21: 30 Israel time).
Three days later, the national team will host Estonia at the Shlomo Group Hall.
In parallel with the intensive training with the national team, Blazer also dealt with his future last week, until he signed for two years at Hapoel Jerusalem.
"I have a quiet head now that I have found a team," he tells Israel Hayom in his first and special interview since signing.
"I have a bit of pressure now because I have to move with the family after we settled in the central area and it's not easy, but there are no phones anymore and from a professional point of view I'm much calmer."
You haven't been in the national team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to have fun in the national team and I come with the attitude of contributing everything I can, whether it's from my experience or on the pitch.
Of course I would love to play, but when you get to the national team everyone has to put their ego aside and do everything for the national team to be successful.
I'm here for what you need from me. "
Now you are 14 players, and the European Championship will be joined by Dani Avdija, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and maybe there will be more changes.
Did you set a goal to be on the roster for the championship?
"I would love to be on the pitch and contribute."
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99 m) has played for Maccabi Tel Aviv for the past two years.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring the Jerusalemites to Hapoel Holon.
You had other offers, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
"They showed very great willingness for me to be there, so it was a relatively easy negotiation.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I realized that this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and appropriate to me.
I come to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I spoke to the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and of winning, and that's exactly what I bring.
I have always loved playing in the arena, because I get energies as well with the crowd is against me, and now that they will be on my side it will be even better.
I'm sure there will be a committed and fun group and I wanted to be a part of that. "
Tell us a little about your conversation with Coach Djicic.
"Professionally, he believes in a lot of movement without the ball, he plans to bring good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energy in defence and attack and with the crowd in the arena it can be successful. "
I looked at your career and saw that in every team you stay for at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel that you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
"Everywhere I go, I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone didn't stop ringing and beeping.
I got a lot of messages already waiting for me.
I think we have a good time ahead of us. "
Do you think that in Jerusalem you can be a more significant player than in Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you sum up your two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv?
"Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional throughout, and no matter how much I got - I always gave everything.
I'm proud of the way I did last year, and now everyone goes their own way. "
If it were up to you, would you want to stay at Maccabi?
"After the last year, it was clear to both sides that we were heading in the direction of separation, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I got a bit hurt in minutes and my status went down, although in the middle of the year I had an excellent time, but they decided to go in other directions.
After understanding the situation there, I realized it was less the place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it. "
Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the semi-final of the cup last season when I shouted to Ami Bitton (team manager at Maccabi Tel Aviv-Yam) 'That's what I'm here for,' so that's what I came to Jerusalem for - to take titles."

All or nothing: 1: 1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but managed to make amends with an equaliser 10 minutes later •
Later on, the midfielder was sent off for a questionable red (74) •
Hadera also stayed at 10 players following a red for the duty of Ido Levy (87)
The professional team of Hapoel Jerusalem counted the number of strangers on the lawn in Teddy, much more than once, it should be noted, and at one point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was sent off).
This time, to their delight, everything went well, and the 1: 1 they achieved against Hapoel Hadera will not be taken away from them by the Association's court.
Before the red suffered by Hadida, he had time to score an own goal and equalize to clinch a precious point for Lazio Aria.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida's private show began.
Falkushchenko charged wide, and the midfielder lifted and slammed back and the ball was stopped in his team's net.
0: 1 to Hadera who enjoyed an own goal by the midfielder.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida managed to make amends and a giant - Levkovic caught air and the midfielder this time hit the right net and exposed.
1: 1 in the teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to register a second yellow and red for his duty, this time after sliding in Marmentini's direction.
Daniel Bar Nathan decided on a dubious red and sent the midfielder straight into an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Nathan also sent Ido Levy in red and balanced the balance of power on the grass.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon
60: 85
Ariel Beit Halachmi's team scored a third victory in a row, this time particularly impressive •
Hoover and Schuchman (15CA) excelled
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey continued this evening (Saturday) with an impressive 60: 85 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a seasonal 0: 3 balance in the meetings between the two.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel Beit Halachmi's team already has three consecutive victories, and in fact this is a surprise only for those who did not see the game.
We haven't seen such bad weather in a long time.
All this before the series opener against Besiktas in the Champions Cup play-in: Only 60 points, a first half without a three-pointer and 11 percent for three in the entire game.
The bottom line is that it was an unimpressive evening for all the team's players (with the exception of Murphy Manko, who scored Holon's 3-pointers), including the safe stock Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in good shape thanks to Roy Hoover and Joaquin Shuchman (15 points).
The former regained himself in the final period and the latter returned to flourish and also stunned with a basket from three quarters of the court.
Give them a chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv's Israelis saved Spropoulos
After a loss in the derby and eighth in a row in Europe, a setback in the Clasico against Jerusalem - apparently, would have ended the long affair between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach •
So who does Yanis have to send a bouquet of flowers to tonight?
To his Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points in the arena •
And also: Why the Yellow Club needs to change its "Americanization strategy," and take a living example from the model of Ariel Beit Halachmi in Eilat
It is hard to remain cynical at the sight of the teary eyes and the warm and strong hugs that Yannis Spropoulos gave to his players at the end of the game tonight at the arena, and especially in the face of the tight mouth and the secret exchange with John Divertolmau, who with his own hands saved the Greek coach the job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after a home loss in the derby and eighth straight in Europe, to also lose in the Clasico to Jerusalem and walk away from it to three wins in the table?
It would have already ended the Israeli-Greek affair tonight.
So in the meantime, he is with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also and actually mainly about the EuroLeague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came up with a radical change in the habits of attacking and moving the ball.
The ball moved with dedication, with a lot of movement and drills, and Scottie Wilbkin, demonstrably, left the craft of concentration to Evans, dribbling very little, and mostly going over blocks and going for shots.
Despite scoring very badly (2-9 from the field), Wilbkin contributed defensively, and most of all, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
Despite this, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team returned to the old habits, and the attacks reverted back to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a lead of 2 and 40 seconds to go, Scotty dribbled himself into half a corner and threw a floater on one leg that almost lost the game.
The trick is to continue to play drills and pass movement precisely in the clutch moments, and this must enter the nature and the group DNA.
The important learning will be done by Yannis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
The ones who became water vacuums and towel-wavers at games in Europe.
Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them more than half the team's points (42 of 83), and were the ones who kept the game alive at the finish.
Four of Maccabi's top five scorers were its Israelis.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can help in the EuroLeague as well.
In the first half, it was mostly Oz Blazer, whose section has been crying out for a month that he must play more.
A scorer, a moral, a fighter under the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 yards of defensive determination and game wisdom.
Is that not enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen starred, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and covering for the injury of Zizic, and especially John Dee, who at 70: 63 to Jerusalem changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.
Yanis has a complicated relationship with Yeftah Ziv, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and burdens him too much, to the point of risking a loss.
It happens in the EuroLeague as well, and it happened tonight as well.
But the important learning should be the club's, about its Americanisation strategy.
Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Davrat is choosing Jerusalem, or maybe rejected by Maccabi.
And this happens because there are gradually fewer places for Israelis in Maccabi, because of the club's informed and rooted choice to be based on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play in it, and then it will look for Jewish children to be naturalized, and pressure the director / association to further increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake by the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it is overdoing it with the foreigners, a lot because of the tax rebate.
Of course, it is not claimed that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star and another eight mediocre ones, allow five excellent ones.
For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Tylor, it was possible to bring in two stars (a star coordinator and a super forward) who are effective and stable next to Scotty and Zizic.
It will be more effective, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and it will generate identification.
It's true that there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even receives tax relief from the state for its so-called representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association / the league administration can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 in form, maximum three on the field at the same time.
Is it because of the ongoing failed achievements (for seven years in Europe), only for Maccabi, that the league is flooded with foreigners?
As for the players, how about you?
Is that what you sat for?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there's one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargaining to get less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in the above direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and another 4 Israelis who were only two in the young teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Roina and Shochman the Warrior), she dismantled Holon (second in the table!) for the second time in the last two weeks.
It is a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run even in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot in the days of Sharon Drucker.
Short Eilat is simply a more balanced and effective team, and there is nothing like Ariel Beit Halachmi, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at the peak of their fitness, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The foreigners are only complementing.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from the knee injury, it will be a tremendous group.
A song I dreamed of.
And that Maccabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "There was a feeling that the whole world was against us"
The Yellows are happy after the 78: 83 win over Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena: "We are back to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play" •
About Ami Bitton's conversation in the dressing room, the optimistic first diagnosis of Zizic's injury and the management's approval of the purchase.
A great sense of relief is registered this morning (Sunday) among Maccabi Tel Aviv after the important and prestigious 78: 83 yesterday at the Hapoel Jerusalem Arena.
The team's players and management members hugged with coach Yiannis Spropoulos who looked very excited at the conclusion.
Yeftah Ziv and Oz Blazer poured water enthusiastically on the outstanding Derrick Williams in the game, and the rest of the club also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the recent sequence of losses.
They too were afraid of a defeat against the great rival that would further undermine the system.
Fans, too, stayed for long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
"There's an amazing connection between us and Yannis in a dressing room," Oz told Blazer.
"We know that the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We were very much waiting for it, also in the way we played.
We returned to playing the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with heart and fight, we stand behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us. "
Before the game, team manager Ami Bitton entered the locker room and said exciting things to the players.
"His stuff had a big impact on how we came out and how we played on the court," Maccabi players said.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi are already targeting the important game against Basconia on Thursday and want to interrupt the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the last few games we were under a lot of pressure, Ianis told us that if we were free we would win these games.
I believe this win will take us forward.
A lot of eyes were on us and it was a feeling of the whole world against us, I am proud to go to this war, we cut off everything around us and look only at ourselves. "
Ante Zizic who injured his right knee during the final quarter was examined by medical staff in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
The doctors will check how the knee will react today and then it will become clear how many days of rest he will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Basconia.
Apart from the firm backing given by the management to Spropoulos and the professional staff, at a meeting held on Thursday, the professional manager Nikola Vučić was given the green light to bring in one or two players to strengthen the team, and the yellows hope to add quality acquisitions soon.
Anthony Bennett released from Hapoel Jerusalem
The forward who was selected first in the NBA draft failed to acclimate to the team from the capital •
The club said goodbye: "Anthony entered the hearts of all of us, we thank him for his time in Hapoel."
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released Sunday from the team's roster.
The forward (28, 2.03) who was selected first overall in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers recorded 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games in the Champions League as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in the Premier League.
"Hapoel Jerusalem and the player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision on the termination of the player's contract at the club," the club said, "Anthony entered the hearts of all of us and we wish to thank him for his time at Hapoel.
We wish him nothing but good and success. "
Study states: Zoom meetings hurt creativity
Some 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem - some in video sessions, some in face-to-face meetings •
The result: A virtual meeting hurts creativity and thinking outside the box •
Research leader at Columbia University: "The visual focus on the screen harms the process of creating ideas"
Nehema Porta: There is no harm to productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of video sessions on the creativity of their participants, compared to face-to-face sessions.
Sadly, it has been found that creativity does get compromised in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question - led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University - was whether remote meetings using a computer preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of remoteness.
The research itself began as early as 2016 but got a big boost during the two years of the coronavirus, during which many employees switched to working from home.
"People in an in-person meeting move around the room, use objects and use them for creative thinking," says Brooks.
"In a computer meeting, on the other hand, the concentration on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which impairs the broad and expansive idea creation process. "
The space is shrinking.
To test the results of the experiment and make sure they would be repeated, they were tested twice - once at Columbia University and once more in real life - on engineers who knew each other from early acquaintance.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty members and students into two parts - in one, the subjects were asked to meet in person and develop solutions to the problem, and in the other, they were asked to do so through a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide themselves in a similar way and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking was found among those who met virtually on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who studies ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people often look at their surroundings to help create ideas, while in a video session, thinking converges on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.
"When people are in the same room, they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can evoke new associations.
On the other hand, the study shows that relationships through a computer change our attention so that we are more focused inward and on the screen, and this way reduces innovation and the creation of ideas through looking at the environment and thinking outside. "
There is no harm in critical thinking.
However, before managers rush employees back to the offices, the researchers note that "working through a computer did not harm productivity itself nor people's critical thinking about innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
In other words, the harm is aimed only at creativity and not at other forms of work in front of a computer. "
Professor Ellen Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also disapproves of the findings.
According to her, "There is a difference between just creativity, such as new uses for Frisbee (one of the research questions) and solutions of work.
It's also possible that when employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or when they work from home, creativity will improve. "
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also proposed a future study in which such meetings would be interrupted for thinking situations and wandering around the room to see how this activity would affect the final result.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study, only for brainstorming sessions would employees return to work and as a general rule, he suggested not to be alarmed by one study but to conduct another investigation in the field.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forced back and not being happy is a bigger hurt" he says.
Musk awaits Trump's return: "It wasn't right to block him"
The fresh acquirer of Twitter said it would reverse a decision, which led to the blocking of the former US president's account •
"I think it was a mistake," he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter in a deal valued at $44 billion, said Tuesday he intends to bring Trump back to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after rioting by his supporters on Capital Hill after his election loss to Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake, "" he said.
"If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and a suspension - a temporary suspension - is proper, but not a permanent ban," Musk clarified.
By 2050: The world will lose 80% of water available for agriculture
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years •
The Solution: Proper Water Management
A disturbing new study, recently published in the journal Earth's Future, predicts that by 2050 the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and world population growth remain at their current usage trends.
In the study, in which scientists from all scientific agencies in the world participated, the scientists summed up the total amount of rainwater, rivers and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The grim conclusions of the study show that currently the rate of water consumption has been repeatedly doubling over the past 10 years, while at the same time global warming is causing a decrease in the amount of rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study's data, 84% of the world's agricultural land will experience a severe shortage of rainwater.
One of the main conclusions that emerged from the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and the seasons, and to switch to growing methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the evaporation process that will lead to extensive waste of rainwater.
Also, the researchers recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources, use rainwater collection technologies in order to prevent their flow into the sea.
Information about many Bar Ilan University students leaked online
Hackers who attacked the database of Bar Ilan University a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about the students if they did not receive a financial ransom.
The threat was realized and the information was published throughout the network.
Students at Bar-Ilan University are under attack from hackers when their personal information was published across the network by a network attacker known as Darkrypt who published a ransom demand from university officials a few weeks ago and threatened that if he was not paid an unclear amount of money, he would publish the information under his control.
Estimates of the amount of money demanded by the attacker are that it began in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked, it rose and before the information was published it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty members are filled with angry messages and the mess is festering there, with students unable to log into their personal information systems and unable to perform regular student assignments.
The university sent an e-mail message in which it said that the academic institution had been attacked and that they were working intensively to reduce the damage, while detailing some of the information leaked to the network.
No special instructions were given to those whose information was hacked and it was said there that the university carried out a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's servers.
In line for 40 localities: The optical fiber is coming to Benjamin
The trend of networking the periphery with high-speed Internet continues and now the optical fiber is reaching the Binyamin Council, which includes 40 communities •
The project in cooperation with the council and the telecommunications companies Telran, X-Fiber and Internet Pomegranate will get underway immediately after the holidays.
Benjamin Council signed a wide-ranging agreement of its kind over the weekend to lay optical fibers in all council localities.
The agreement with the Net-Fiber project in cooperation with Rimon Internet, Telran and X-Fiber was signed after the completion of a large tender that the council worked on in recent months.
The work will begin after the holidays and residents from the 40 council communities who will be interested in connecting to the fiber optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 gigabit as well as advanced end-to-end equipment for the home that will allow strong WIFI reception, as required in these times.
Those who join will be able to choose between high-speed Internet over fiber optics or high-speed filtered Internet over fiber optics, which will be provided by Internet Grenade.
The council has made sure that the market remains open to competition in any situation.
The head of the Benjamin Regional Council, Israel Gantz: "This is true Zionism.
This is great news for residents.
The experience of living in Benjamin will improve, students will be able to study remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in communities that will receive high-quality internet without delays.
I want to wish success to the dear companies in the execution tasks in the communities.
The people are waiting for you. "
Gantz added: "Soon we will have proper conditions for high-speed Internet from the best in Israel.
We have labored for many months to bring a foundation for the fiber installation and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank Communications Minister Yoaz Handel, who started the project with us in his previous term, and now we are reaping the fruits of the labor, the staff of the Communications Minister, the council members who were entrusted with the details of the center and the CEOs of the companies that won the center for professional quality from the best in Israel. "
CEO of Internet Rimon, Yariv Parr: "I thank the head of the council, Israel Gantz, and his team for immediately picking up the gauntlet in order to bring news to the thousands of council residents who will switch to using high-speed Internet that will improve the quality of life in the fields of education, the economy and of course leisure."
CEO of Telran Media Group, Shai Aslan: "We are pleased with the decision of the Binyamin Council to connect to high-speed and powerful Internet infrastructure and I am confident that thanks to the group's extensive experience we will be able to provide residents with high-speed Internet just like in the center of the country."
X-Fiber CEO, Israel Elitzur: "The construction of communication infrastructure in Benjamin is the Zionism of 2021, X-Fiber is proud to take part in the construction of the state-of-the-art infrastructure in the biblical areas of Benjamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with the territories of Judea and Samaria in general and Benjamin in particular, we will meet every engineering challenge in order to bring high-speed Internet to every home throughout the council."
We checked: What do the side effects after the coronavirus vaccine say?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weakness, fever and fatigue after getting the shot, while others feel nothing •
Could this indicate a stronger immune system in those who do experience these symptoms, or is it a baseless rumor?
As more and more people get vaccinated, the lack of information about the side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are untrue.
Is the immune system of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies responded less severely to the vaccine, which could perhaps prove that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body entering the body?
"There are several levels of reactions to the vaccine," says Dr. David Dvir, head of the division of primary medicine at the United Nations and a member of the advisory committee for the TCM (Pandemic Treatment Team), and reassures: "Headaches, fatigue, pain in place, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body reacts when a foreign body enters the system. "
Is there a link between the levels of antibodies one develops and the side effects?
"There is no correlation between the sensations and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 60% -50% experience side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
People who developed stronger responses were not found to be more protected. "
"In the medical literature, there is no correlation between an immediate response and the level of vaccination.
In some trials where people also received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
This is also a mental component - how the person perceives the vaccine, if they expect there to be side effects.
Many of the phenomena that happen could also happen normally, but since the public has been vaccinated, it attributes the reaction to the vaccine itself, and this is the bias that we see regarding vaccines in general - attribution of phenomena that happen near the vaccine and are attributed to it. "
According to Dr. Dvir, the reasons for the commonly reported symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions are divided.
"There are all kinds of theories about this, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One theory is that it's a strong immune response. "
Is it even possible to assess the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, it was shown that those who did not sleep or were under higher pressure were more vulnerable to infection.
Apart from this, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there is a decline in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People are contracting a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not that someone is walking around with a weak immune system and not aware of it.
These are people who come for inquiries because of repeated incidents of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: Stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want an immune system that is too strong, because it can cause autoimmune diseases. "
Soon, mRNA vaccines will appear in additional contexts, thanks to the extensive knowledge that has accumulated about them in recent times.
"There is no doubt that it will pave the way for other vaccines of this kind.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines - for the treatment of oncological diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance remains very little time in the body - enters, does its action, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it has received a serious boost following the very great need for a quick vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that a three-week interval between doses is too small, and some vaccine experts claim that after a third dose we may not need another vaccine in the near term, so it is not clear whether we are going to a situation of vaccination every six months or the third dose will give a larger interval. "
Thousands injured: Serious privacy omission on Highway 6
Customers of Route 6?
Your personal information, including full name, addresses, payment amounts and full details of the trips you have taken, may have been disclosed.
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
Following a report submitted by Derech Eretz, the operator of Route 6 in Israel, about a security incident that occurred at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement procedure.
As part of the incident, security weaknesses were discovered on its payment site, which allowed the disclosure of a lot of information from the invoices of the member's customers, which were exposed to all eyes.
Among other things, customers' payment invoices were exposed over a long period of time and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, location of the vehicle, travel dates and at what times.
In addition, since Derech Eretz did not document access to its systems as required by law, it is not possible to know precisely for how long unauthorized parties could access the company's systems.
In the violation letter, which the Privacy Protection Authority sent to the company, the Authority emphasized that most companies and large organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that with the development of threats and risks, the organization has an obligation to rigorously examine the updated risks and act in accordance with the update of the security measures accepted in the circumstances, in accordance with the nature and nature of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations are required to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and penetration tests to examine and prepare for the changing risks.
In addition, companies and organizations are required to use an automatic documentation mechanism and training must be conducted for employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Protection (Information Security) Regulations.
In accordance with the findings of the inspection, the Authority determined that the company violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations, and also required the company to take a number of corrective actions.
Derech Eretz, the operator of Route 6, said: "The issue was handled in accordance with the strictest requirements."

The skies of Saudi Arabia are approaching: Israeli companies are preparing to reinforce lines to the east
The consolidating tally for expanded flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe
Israel's largest airline is planning significant changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we published in "Israel Today," it is believed that Biden will announce the granting of permission to El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to more destinations besides the UAE.
The meaning of the emerging agreement is that you will be able to fly on shorter routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.
To do this, the company will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, in order to evacuate aircraft in favor of new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations where there is a fairly large Jewish population, but at this stage they are less profitable for the company.
On the other hand, the new destinations that El Al is exploring are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
This is how the move will be carried out: The Dreamliner planes flying to Canada will be released in favor of long flights to the east.
The Boeing 737 aircraft flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which El Al operates flights using the Dreamliner aircraft.
So basically the company will be able to free up large planes to fly to more destinations in the east.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to return to flying to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Exempt from isolation for the vaccinated and recovering from non-red countries, the foreign tourists are returning.
Those who landed in Israel received notices from the Ministry of Health that they are exempt from the isolation obligation upon receiving a negative answer to the coronavirus test •
Only after that did the ministry issue an official notice saying that only passengers from orange countries were involved, even though returnees from red countries also reported receiving the notice •
In addition: Tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and the removal of many red destinations from the list is expected.
At the height of a pandemic - the end to isolation for returnees from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent notices to returnees to Israel on Monday morning, according to which they are exempt from isolation upon receiving a negative answer to the coronavirus test they took after landing in Israel.
It's also about returning from red states.
Some of the messages sent informed the returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative reply or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative reply.
Only after that did an official announcement come out from the Ministry of Health stating that starting tonight at midnight, January 4, 2022, vaccinated or recovered, returnees from orange countries will take a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and go into isolation for 24 hours or until a negative result is received (whichever comes first).
The decision will be enshrined in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be submitted to the Knesset Health Committee for approval.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovered people who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they took upon entering Israel will end isolation tonight at midnight and are not obliged to take a second test.
Despite this, passengers from red countries reported that they too had received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and returned from an orange country will enter home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening isolation upon receiving a negative result in a PCR test performed starting from the 7th day of landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to remove most of the restrictions on flights and especially on the vaccinated comes a day before the hearing in the High Court of Justice submitted by the Association of Travel Agencies, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association.
At a hearing to be held tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand that all other red states be removed from the list, with Professor Itamar Grotto backing them in his opinion.
Foreigners will also be able to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transport agreed that as of Sunday, January 9, 2022, vaccinated / recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) from orange countries will be allowed to enter - subject to filling out an online form in advance, taking a PCR or antigen test before boarding, taking a PCR test upon entering Israel and then entering isolation for 24 hours or receiving a negative test result (whichever comes first).
Unvaccinated / non-recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, except those whose entry has been approved by the exceptions committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The group layout will not be renewed at this time.
And what about red states?
The Committee for the Classification of Countries at the Ministry of Health recommends that the government remove from the list of red countries and transfer to the orange list the countries: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain on the red list at this stage are: The United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option that the Ministry of Health is considering is to exempt from isolation the vaccinated who return from red countries.
At the moment it is not clear whether there is a connection between the messages received this morning by those returning to Israel and the guidelines that may be received from the Ministry of Health on this issue.
No response has yet been received from the Ministry of Health.
The sky is starting to open: The Ministry of Health changes the restrictions on the gates of the country
Vaccinated returning from orange countries will be charged with 24-hour isolation •
The countries the US, Turkey, the UK and the UAE will be designated red.
After long weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which one could fly without restrictions, and after all returnees from abroad were required to isolate, along with a ban on the entry of tourists to Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend canceling the obligation to isolate for three days for Israelis returning from orange countries.
Until now, anyone vaccinated or recovered according to the definitions of the Ministry of Health who returned from an orange country - was required to isolate for three days, subject to two corona tests.
Now, the isolation that the vaccinated and recovered returning from orange countries will have to enter is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of the coronavirus tests are received after landing at Ben Gurion Airport (whichever comes first).
Those who are not defined as vaccinated or recovered will nevertheless be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two corona tests, or 14 days without the second test, both if returning from an orange country and if returning from a red country.
Vaccinated or recovered who returned from a red country must also be in full isolation.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to pass government approval, includes the US, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the UK, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, with the exception of Turkey, the average of positives who entered the country in the last two weeks is more than 5% of the total number of arrivals, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase in patients from Turkey is rapid, the rate of positive returnees from it is just over 4%, so it was decided to put it on the list of red countries as well.
The notable countries to be removed from the list of red countries: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, starting January 9, tourists who are vaccinated according to the requirements of the Ministry of Health will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, similar to the conditions for Israelis returning from an orange country.
Even in this case, the decision is subject to the approval of the government, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
The tourists are against the restrictions.
The Association of Travel Agencies, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association filed a petition with the High Court to cancel the restrictions on flights.
The country removed the majority of restrictions yesterday, but as mentioned left eight significant countries on the list of red countries.
At a hearing to be held this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red states.
The person who will support the petitioners' position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razvozov, who in recent weeks has supported easing restrictions on the entry of foreign tourists into Israel, said yesterday: "The abolition of isolation for the vaccinated returning from abroad and the return of tourism to the vaccinated are the right and just thing at this time.
I thank my colleagues in the government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighs the benefit.
The vaccine is the best response to the pandemic, and as such - the vaccinated public deserves to lead an enabling routine alongside the corona. "
With an investment of NIS 200 million: The new resort to be opened near Arad
The desert is booming: Another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years •
Chef restaurants, private pools and 110 rooms are just a small part of what the hotel will offer •
All the details in the article
The 7MINDS company from Beit Fattal and the White City Buildings real estate company have jointly purchased a plot of about 20 dunams in the Judean Desert, where they will build a luxurious resort with an investment of about NIS 200 million. The hotel will be built on the same area where the Masada Hotel was built, which was destroyed about a year ago.
The resort will open only in about three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three communal pools, a spa, chef restaurants, a recreation complex, a gym and more.
The person who will be responsible for the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ran Shmueli from Claro Restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one to build the menu, which is expected to have a unique desert concept for the resort.
The mayor of Arad, attorney Nisan Ben Hamo, welcomed the project: "The decision to build a new and prestigious hotel near Arad gives the official stamp to the amazing success that Arad has made in the field of tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the choice of the developers and am convinced that it will be a joint success since Arad has enormous tourism potential. "

Almost every person these days, has an "old" tablet or smartphone lying in a useless cupboard.
Only because a slightly newer and more sophisticated model has come out can any device have a Spotify player instead of a Hotspot connection.
Old devices can be road cameras, remote controls for operating devices at home and many other uses.
You don't have to be a victim of consumer culture and you don't always have to be at the forefront of technology, with yet another truly useless gadget.
Collecting data without analysis.
It's a shame
It was more interesting to hear how many people received allowances from the Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the centers of the requested cities) is worth, and how much the employees' wages are (minimum).
Israel Post cannot be privatized
The question is how many packages arrived and how many were distributed?
How many of them disappeared.
Packages are ordered, and they disappear in the intelligence sorting center.
There should be a package tax of 5 shekels that will not just order nonsense in shekels and load the mail
This is mainly indicative of the cost of living in the country.
Thanks to the king of pucks who made it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to go near the mail and hope that no letters will come from them and the hatred for the mail has led us to give up everything that belongs to the possibility of mail.
Have a good week.
Lay off all postal workers, and start re-establishing the post office - by a private company.
Employers are patronising and some are racist!
On the phone, they speak differently and when they arrive for an interview, their true face is revealed.
No wonder they don't have employees.
They are looking for slaves.
Jobs of the slaves

Who is that?!
Why is it on a news site?
This is not Guy Pines or the Zion of Nonsense Moses.
It smells like a well-oiled PR and is invited under the guise of an article by a shekel yard that hides behind the name of the newspaper's editorial board.
The joke at the expense of US readers, the captive audience who escaped the clutches of the venomous Moses and seek an alternative
The song is not to my taste and the clip is casual
Lovely lovely lovely lovely
What a talent!!!
They want more and more from him.
Tamir Greenberg is a great singer at the level of an international star.
The State of Israel is small.
He's going to break out in a big way.
A clinical optometrist?!
The title does not apply to the country of origin.
Who is the next sector in line?
The Bibists?
And corneal mapping the main thing didn't mention.
Alec is a clinical optometrist.
Clinically on her own behalf.
Where will there be sirens?
War is preparing us.
And what will the battle looms what cruelty
Bennett Lapid and Gantz on landing Biden: Get ready friends get ready.
Because they are the champions of champions!!
Hahahaha but don't worry, even when managers are screwed and stupid, we have abilities above and beyond what is expected!!
That's right, and besides, our dimensions, like most of them, are fucked up.
The Home Front Command is playing "as if" games, because at the time of the artist - we won't know.
Why only in Tel Aviv
The rest are right-handed.
Despite the nice talk - we have not heard about the arrest of hackers, you put on trial and justice with them
And in the last four election campaigns, was the Election Commission prepared for an attack?
Why not elaborate for example.
Several infiltration and disruption attempts have been made and several have succeeded in penetrating the Election Commission in the last 3 years.
Don't we deserve some data, facts and proportion?
One of the more bizarre signings of Hapoel Jerusalem.
Good luck to Oz.
You will always be a part of the team's legacy.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
See blackness all of you, just claims and tortures, classic armchair yams.
Baldwin a social attack in the dressing room, so say players who played with him in both Greece and Spain!
Hollins was injured and didn't play in the Red Star's last few games.
Hilliard was also injured and did not play for the last six months.
The stakes are heavy.
Missing out on stardom
What it's really about with Brown
If he doesn't sign, he could be in trouble.
What about Lorenzo Brown?
Hahahahaha how fits like a glove next to a loser for a group of.
A great person A player The coach must give him more minutes Don't give him up Hapoel needs a big squad Don't give him up
The No.
Bring on Adrian Banks.
We need more strong Israelis in the squad.
The ones that really play.
Much more suitable than Wilbkin for the Maccabi you built.
You see that there are professionals in Maccabi - Blatt and Ketesh.
Perhaps personal abilities still ler compared to the Scot but team player, and especially game intelligence are much higher
It's so sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis warm the bench
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners, so they will not succeed with all the stars who have scraped from around the world
Who is interested???
If you already watch a game in which 6 American players and 3 Israelis decorate, isn't it better to watch a game of Golden State???
Puzzle until the end of the league.
May it be good luck
A good column though.
I was loved up.
As for the Israelis, he is absolutely right!!
And a comment about Ziv - we saw last season that this is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he cannot be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost confidence (which is no wonder after the attitude he received after 2 bad games in the Euroleague, as if foreigners did not have such games) and his use may also be wrong, and is the result of the coach's fixations and stencils.
Blazer didn't score with all due respect.
Yeftah Ziv should not be in Maccabi Tel Aviv, he is destroying it too much
There used to be not a good game but Sorkin and Doddie Blazer and also Cohen today well done.
Ido Eshed is a bum fan of Holon who was given 500 shekels, so he writes nonsense.
Pictured is not Federman.
Blazer, Sorkin and Gek Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor in Europe who play about 20 minutes and are not able to score a basket, who needs foreigners at the level of nothing and nothing, it's much better for the Israelis to play.
It's good to have a good spirit for everyone coach players and management in the mammoth draw
Depending on increasing internal processing.
And disciplinary and required strengthening of coordinator and guard
And that's the management part.
That is not true.
Direct human interaction is important in many ways.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is a bad thing both from the professional aspect and the truth, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the camera on Zoom and the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom and so their creativity wasn't enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years?
Someone missed an important detail.
Scientists don't care about warming or rain.
They only care about population growth.
They are working on more and more vaccines and bizarre methods to destroy the world's population, so they tell us foggy stories about warming and other nonsense they invent.
There is no problem to desalinate water, in unlimited quantities
They said it 50 years ago.
Meanwhile, there are more people.
The solution is birth control, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the rest of their anti-state leftists, and in all religions that believe in gods - in the stupid, the ignorant, the foolish, the blind, or in short - in the herds.
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living creatures (also sesmolans) consume oxygen and emit carbon report.
The solution: Sessmolans, commit suicide!
This is a green one.
Good for the world.
May you all be better, and may the Earth and all of us be safe.
Who are the researchers and how did they do the research?
I don't believe every study that talks about climate warming because that thing doesn't exist
He is trending to control us to plunder our liberty and freedom.
It's all part of the new world order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side as he did during the time of corona.
I have never heard from him a presentation of facts from both sides always he brings the side that serves the globalists.
We are being bullied.
Just burn money on academic "remorse" research.
As usual, another drawing from the land of drawings of psychopathic schemers.
The situation is actually improving. Human knowledge is expanding and with it new technologies and improvements.
For centuries, the world's population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, launched a huge war project in the Gobi Desert, with remarkable success.
The Saudis are doing the same and succeeding as well (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It is precisely the stupid "climate crisis" of the Semolans (carbon dioxide emissions, needed by plants) that is causing the Sahara to become greener, but hey, it does not fit the Semolan agenda, so you will not read about it in the newspapers.
The leftists don't worry.
Their urine goes straight to the head and so they do not dry out.
Does proper management of water resources mean cutting at least 70% of the world's population?
It is surprising that COVID came and it is surprising that the majority of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose consequences for a period of 5-25 years for those injected are not known at all.
It is also surprising that Agenda 2030 is underway and now this?
Really puzzling the whole story!!!
Lol what bullshit that is.
Tales of a thousand night and night, it's all scares and of course nonsense of the left trying to control the world through control of the media, five years ago they announced there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rainfall for two years.
They said that it didn't rain anymore in the country and the drought is constant and here it is raining.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena and that Peres did not know that Taman children were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not rob antiquities and Ezer Weizmann did not mess with his soldiers.
It is obvious that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
That is disgusting sabre-rattling.
Who will also take care of absorption in the axes, handling power outages and voltage drops and we are on the wave
"This is true Zionism," just as the opening of the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
Following the crook Bennett, the other lickety politicians will draw a line in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I'm not getting close to God, or rather "shoe on"
It was nice to say hello and not see each other.
You won't see me in your dreams either.
One more big shame, we in Israel are held captive by the Elal company, all direct flights are in the hands of price pigs, it's better that you go bankrupt already, it's time for a truly open sky.4
Some focus on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows Alal to fly over its territory, it will not add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big game changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as the supply of energy, the purchase of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates, tourism and enabling Israeli companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
That's a lot more interesting than 30 planes a week that would save an hour each.
It is more important that they allow air force squadrons to be stationed in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran and that they organize the Emirates of Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Morocco to drop weapons on Iran non-stop for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another squadron of the air force to settle in northern Saudi Arabia and strike the Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from the east from a less crowded area.
After we finish with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti and the Comoros into a peace agreement with Israel and get a majority of the Arab League countries to join the peace.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdogan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia overthrow the government in Qatar and finally eliminate the subversion of this country, and its support for other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these common interests come to an end, it will be possible to talk about a few more flights of El Al, if El Al survives until then.
El Al has to close.
Selling tickets for flights that don't take place.
The worst thing is that there is no way to get a representative
"There is no customer service."
Anyone who buys a ticket at El Al and wants to change or cancel it will forget about it, a sure loss.
See you have been warned.
Air Canada is better
They prefer to travel abroad.
Arkka has turned from a shit company into a hell of a company
El Al also went down a level.
Best to get a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you sued on the train to the field
40 euros a suitcase on Ryanair is much cheaper than Wizz.
A backpack weighing 8 kg can be lifted.
Why are you guys misleading?
Wizz Air on charge and return take much more significantly!!!
One big fidget
Just for example just now I came back if I hiyad
The permissible weight is 30 kg
And a 7kg trolley
Each additional 1 kg is $30.
Go get updated
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices, but in the end it's a bag the size of a school bag.
A trolley already costs money and a suitcase costs very, very expensive.
It's lucky that the companies don't ask us to come on the flight with underwear and a tank top so that there's no weight on the plane.
At El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% of the cost when booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, using a successful method.
A country eats its inhabitants and eats.
To this must be added genetic stinginess.
Shame on our country that allows foreign airlines to torture Israelis.
There is no government and everyone does what they want.
So what did you learn today that it's not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket.
Prepare a surprise for us all.
You will pay extra on the wheels of the plane, on the windows, on the luggage that does not arrive, on the food, on the drinks, and they will certainly add on the toilets
Stay at home and prices will go down.
Or big get out on the ships
Journey will take a few days
Come on, you'll probably come too.
Bennett wants to test how much he can attack and harm Israel, and still win the support of his new fans.
To open up now?
This is no accident.
Precisely when the rush begins there is an exemption, just delusional what is happening here.
This is not the peak of the epidemic.
Sorry, not suitable for you.
The number of confirmed rises does not mean the number of patients is rising
Stop being tested for any nonsense, sit at home if you don't feel well
The story is over
A government of lunatics
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
A loss of control.
And mostly stupidity
Confusion of the public 0
Only more damage from a trench
I suggest you open a new corner: "The daily and cumulative number of deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The faces and images behind the omission. "
Your ratings will soar.
You do not understand the Minister of Finance for not paying compensation to tourism workers
Bringing on more contagion
They don't care about the people.
8500 have died so far
Anything talk about that?
We are buried, especially the elderly
We have become Russia / North Korea.
If you don't talk about it, it doesn't exist!
The main thing is that the citizens put money into the state coffers to raise the ministers' butts and buttocks!
It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the prime minister!!
Very well, the Omicron pause was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half a people, and there is no point in trying to stop the Omicron - which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, he is statistically less dangerous than someone who is already here.
This is the first time I see sensible steps by the Israeli government in the fight against corona.
As if someone really sat and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi - did what he thought would look better in the newspaper (and failed in all sections).
Dream government at its best:
A finance minister telling teachers of the way to find a new profession two weeks ago was adamant about opening the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education Machishasha beeps at the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and sets her own policy, which puts all schools in complete chaos!
A foreign minister, a clown who comes sick with corona to a government meeting.
And the most clownish prime minister we have had in the country, does not control the situation and loses his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Just a government without leadershipwithout direction, in which all the people of Israel have lost faith.
Go home and beautiful one hour early!!!
Maybe it comes from a bad place, maybe it comes from a loss of control.
Now house prices there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Where are all the forecasters?
They are building a bus station and believe it will affect all the houses.
Except for the sponsorship.
When the exorbitant property tax prices of Arad are revealed, the hotel will return to being a white elephant like its predecessor
We will look amazing.
Lots of good luck.
I feel like it.
What about being photographed completely naked?
Giving up the rubbish
A serious pied à terre for Brear Field
Why are no benefits given to girls in the occupied Galilee by the Muslim Brotherhood?
All for the pickers
In reality, the South is still ours.
Need a passport?
Yet another luxury hotel!
My friends will be there too!
What about a folk hotel for a folk person?
Well done to investments in the [booming] South
Arad is developing and thriving and all respect to the mayor who, since the beginning of his term, has seen an explosion for the good and glory of the city of Arad
Cultural life, society, education and more on the height
Just a great mayor who made the city better!
Well done to you
I wonder how much sponsorship fees Bedouin will pay the owner of the resort.
Make money for sponsorship fees?
And wow, sounds good
Those who can afford only El Al - a company with service and security, the best in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai anything know???
Al on Tin Company.
Neither socially nor economically.
In recent weeks, it has canceled return flights from abroad, you see, sent messages to the Israelis and told them that the flight was canceled, ruined the whole trip, informed the passengers to leave a message on W.App or Messenger and we will return, return after two or even three days.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, is it better to ground planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to Israel, and also prevent economic damage?
Are there other assholes out there?
Free doesn't fly with them either.
Have they already returned the millions of customers they took captive?
EasyJet to Geneva round trip 70 euros.
El on One Direction $560.
From the religious scammer who controls the company together with his fucking son I don't buy even for $10, scammers non-stop.
And afterwards the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be in addition to the price change.
Those who buy tickets put their money on the wing of the plane.
A tin company.
Exercises of the Low Coast Company.
No luggage, no seat selection, certainly no taxes and no food.
Vacation and corona flights.
To all my fellow "Goliaths." On me!
Nature dilutes fools!!
