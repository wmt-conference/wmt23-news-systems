Diego Cocca becomes new Mexico coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca will succeed Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after Qatar's early World Cup exit. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach sparked anger at the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht blooms on" also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Fishing. "Geesthacht blooms" is an action of Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the help of many volunteers from clubs, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth since 2015. Objective: In the Geesthach urban area flower islands are to be created over a wide area, on which insects find food at any time. "In favorable weather conditions, the bees fly out in January to seek food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthachter Nabu. He has hives on the property himself.
So that the endeavor not only remains an action of conservationists and the specialist service environment of the city, but draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory panels are repeatedly placed to the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. Passers-by should be able to inform themselves in this way, which blooms so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will specifically replant at home.
In the first week of January was already the start of the season at the Wildhazel
More recently, shrubs such as winter-scented hedge cherry and winter snowball are found in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the pots on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first tender flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been considered with further signs. "The winter-scented hedge cherry is a very broad bushy shrub and can become between two meters high and three meters wide," can be read there under further information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that but not only the bedding plants now show flowers. In the first week of January was already the start of the season at the Wildhasel. It blooms particularly lush on the directional path at the slope, in the Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of her if he looked down from the sky to Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 pm for a brisk tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102. Birthday.
For the native Munich (15. January 1921) von der Schwanthaler Höh "is the Monday THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and stepping is my life, I can't imagine without it."
With Ernestine Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing the dance legs.
The 97-year-old is recovered in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today you would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life dancing, acting and singing."
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something of a chick in the round of tap dancers. She says, "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl."
Wikipedia: The tap dance was performed in the 19th century. Century developed in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are created during dancing, which fit the optical impression and the music. The dancer also becomes a percussionist musician. The English expression is Tap dance and the French claquettes. The Spanish flamenco might have influenced the tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well-audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, with us big and small, old and young welcome."
And what's the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," says the 102-year-old to BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sports, healthy food and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitalization progresses, the desire for analog is growing again for so many
The speed with which our everyday life became digital hardly allowed us time to set rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either one was one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or one was one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and there for a bottle of Radeberger with the relatives on the phone. Or you looked up a telephone booth. Unforgettable the smell of the Plastehörer and the click of the change coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - picture telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
How to continue in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also Moldova), President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisers.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure., as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was being attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her "tremendous sacrifice."
Moldova is a neighbour of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Chisinau parliament, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with Kremlin support - have become more popular.
These were the celebs' costumes

Oberhof: Bold eighth in World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Cup titles and continues to join his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on the ground as a TV pundit, is still an undisputed record champion with 20 World Cup gold medals. Even partly heavy fog did not prevent permanent winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, it had already been enough with Norway's mixed season for the successful title defense.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the chase, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so he can compensate shooting errors to a certain extent frighteningly easily.
Meanwhile, nothing went together again with Doll. After the veteran had given away all chances of a medal in the opener with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there was only sixth place, things did not go better three days later. Three penalties already in lying down shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in 2017 in this discipline.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago with 0.7 seconds advantage razor-thin over Bö. It was one of only three career successes in total Dolls, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Olympic Eighth of Beijing pulled away without a word after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished in 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is all about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
Us President Joe Biden has insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been tested," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the heart of our strength." Lula responded with regard to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed in a runoff election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. On 1. In January, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Supporters of Bolsonaro stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital, Brasília, in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is reminiscent of the storm on the US Capitol more than two years ago, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently invaded the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied - an obvious nod to his predecessor, Trump.
Short note on the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF wanted posters? They saw the members of the Red Army faction released for denunciation and firing.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which already existed before Corona, such a public mood was made against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's call it late capitalist society. (Here nothing to the really dangerous in pinstripe suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is otherwise rather after Raudis in the S-Bahn or onanists in the park, gives a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is ill-informed, because there are in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong perhaps more "Russian friends" than StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, but: In 1st to 5th place (!) If Ms. Wagenknecht stands, then follows Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone around me who reads this sheet anymore. If it does, it would be high time now. We've reached the familiar level where there's nothing below it anymore.
And at least now, well dialectically, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, ie peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no differentiation is necessary anymore.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This confirmed Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It states: 'I can confirm that my client, through his family lawyer, has made an application to the competent court to have his civil partnership revoked. I don't comment on details. "
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, separation rumors had been around for about a year. After his jungle camp participation, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from the common house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke on the RTL show about marital problems.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
A memorial centre was set up in 1999 in the ruined village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended France's values, Macron said. He also contributed to Franco-German peace. The survivor had campaigned, among other things, for German-French youth encounters.
A curve for 14 houses: In homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ-Series Nordlippische Weiler: In homeien, three or four generations often live under one roof. Here the inhabitants find pure idyll. In summer, sometimes 300 motorcycles per day roar the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup long - and some also right back.
Deutsche Bank boss Christian Sewing considers further interest rate increases in the fight against the high inflation rate "absolutely" necessary. "Inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can easily rise again, and even China's opening-up can give prices a temporary boost, "Sewing told the" Welt am Sonntag. "
The European Central Bank (ECB) had raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth year in a row in early February and another 0.5 percentage point increase for the 16th meeting. March in prospect. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high rates of inflation. At the same time, higher lending rates can delay investment and thus weaken economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for heavily indebted euro states, such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course we have to keep this in mind, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
In the medium term, the ECB aims for price stability in the euro area at an inflation rate of two percent. That target has been a long way off for months. Although price inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of ​ ​ the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent above the level of the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply higher energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federation of German Banks (BdB). "In this I currently see the greatest danger for the German economy. But I'm optimistic that we can avoid that scenario. "
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) in infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue. And he may also be a bit more controversial, "he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out, with which it does not necessarily have to go as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation at the turn of the year - but not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply to some extent because of the lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany tempo." In addition, the Federal Government had recently brought an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines on the way.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that should not automatically mean that from now on we always act so categorically and put the neighbor against his will a wind wheel in the garden, "said Hartung. There must therefore still be a negotiation process, which one finds right and wrong as a society.
In the past, they tried the classic set of rules and did not make it. "We should think again about whether the previous procedure was right. Maybe we've overdone it with the rulebook and made it too complicated. "
However, given the many open tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns of Bayer group smashing
The chemical union IG BCE warns after an announced change of boss at Bayer before a smashing of the group. "From the point of view of the employees, Bayer with its three legs is perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board, the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk spreading and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism."
The background is the announced on Thursday change of chief at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals company. Controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. At the beginning of June, the ex-pharmaceutical chief of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over.
Baumann has long been criticized. The 2018 completed acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars depends on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen had brought expensive lawsuits over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate in the house. The Bayer share was in decline for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to grant discharge to the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which should actually run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had put pressure on them. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also joined in. Bluebell insists, according to a media report on a split of the group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the Rheinische Post. On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to go back against the planned pension reform on the street.
To a government project, the unions oppose the concentrated protest on the street. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected nationwide on Saturday to demonstrate against the planned pension reform of President Emmanuel Macron. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the centre-government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in Parliament for a week.
Already, many people in France work longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid in long enough for a no-deductible pension when they reach the age limit. In many exhausting jobs, people could hardly work longer, say the opponents of reform. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-earned pension and not completely wear out their health in the job.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to pay their contributions for an increasing number of pensioners. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population must work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations, calling for the state to find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But not only at the retirement age, the government wants to screw. The increase in the necessary deposit period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, should be accelerated. In addition, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension should rise to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was canceled, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Already several presidents before Macron tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - broad protest and strikes were all certain.
With Macron's camp no longer having an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of conservative Républicains, which have announced support. However, some of the Members - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote is likely to be Macron's worry about crippling strikes at the moment. Before Saturday's renewed demonstrations, the president said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they went quietly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun in high altitudes
A powerful area of high pressure lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does that mean there is likely to be plenty of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately catches the eye over Central Europe," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high is shifting a bit eastward over the course of the next week. But it continues to determine the weather in Germany. "
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give the people in the lowlands for days dreary high fog gray, while in the highlands of the low mountains there is pure sun."
So the Sunday starts in most regions foggy-cloudy. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it can also rain a bit, according to DWD. Above all on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens during the day and the sun comes out more and more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily overcast or highly mist-like. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the gradually stronger sun nibbles again at the high fog and can dissolve it more and more during the day," says the meteorologist. At the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountains and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere she must first fight through the high fog cover. The maximum values ​ ​ are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine are 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, however, only 3 degrees are expected. In addition, weak wind blows from different directions.
On Tuesday, there can be in some lowlands again only tough resolution of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather is cheerful after fog resolution. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, according to forecasts, the sun shines all day. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator quarrels: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
Beaten top favourite Sofia Goggia has revealed her deep disappointment following her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not bring the performance I can," said the Italian on ZDF, after threading at a goal and being eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old could just prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill rider in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six races of the season so far in this discipline. After gold 2018 in Pyeongchang, she took silver at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, must continue to wait for a World Cup medal in her parade discipline. She was absent from her home game at Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
'I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second, "said Goggia after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel now. 'I'm disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life. " Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the expected and ultimately missed medal of all experts: "But they are not."

Selenskyj and Minister against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. With calls for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed on a joint conference call to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, said the Lithuanian Ministry of Sport on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinenė.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of the UK. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. 'and I've made the UK's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now make a joint statement on this subject. "
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Selenskyj said. He posted his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag was ultimately soaked in blood and not portable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a warring party because it provides military bases for attacks to Russian troops. Selenskyj called on the officials to work for the protection of Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "sadly lost its honesty."
The occasion of the conference was the IOC's announcement that athletes from Russia and Belarus would be able to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott should the IOC allow the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sport, said afterwards that it had also confirmed in the discussions to reject a start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "There is no reason, in our view, to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to competition. Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's ambition to resume Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way to go, "said a spokesman for the Interior Ministry on dpa request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "The sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against Ukrainian civilians. Big sporting events don't take place in a vacuum. " Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided that they clearly subscribe to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.

Half of vehicles lost?: Us sees Moscow's tank inventory severely decimated
Half of the vehicles lost? Us sees Moscow's tank inventory severely decimated
The Pentagon reckons Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the war began. We are talking about "half of the main stock."
The Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to estimates by the US Department of Defense. "Presumably half of the main stockpile of tanks" of the Russian army was "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, secretary of state for international security issues at the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide further details on the number of tanks seized and destroyed by the US assessment at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Ukraine is expected to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2 battle tanks for March. Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, your delivery will take much longer in all likelihood.
Russia wants to refill
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has begged abroad for planes, missiles, tanks," said Medvedev, who is now vice-chief of the Russian Security Council, on a visit to an armored factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "Clearly, in this case, it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
Already since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows for a greater alignment of the economy to the needs of the army. Thus, for example, individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Vortex for post occupation at Heer
Because the post, which will be held in the future by the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is made to a previously unfilled job, said the minister. "Speculation of a liberal staff representative" she did not want to comment. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. These are cleared out from Tanner's point of view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability for content. This is an expert for the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands information from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process." At the decision is the "appearance of Postenschacher," says SPÖ spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees before costs
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs, among other things, for security in Wasungen are difficult to cope with, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total cost of the move.
In Brandenburg, there are no carnival parades. The "train of happy people" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, takes place for the first time after the pandemic. Also at the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht no moves were canceled.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional move despite the increased costs. "We are going through our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. But here, too, the financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors were not found or the previous more contributed, reserves would have to be touched - "that does not work every year." The deficit currently: About 200,000 euros.
And the inflation: In the confectionery there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. Luck in misfortune had ordered too much in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. Nevertheless, it is already clear for the move that it will be more expensive. For security, twice as much staff is needed as in 2020.
Anyone who stands by the wayside on the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have that much with them. Camels or not, the influx of visitors should be great: "I believe that if it should not rain from pots on the day, then we can certainly expect an increased influx of people," says the Cologne train conductor Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that two years just did not take place a regular Rosenmontagszug. There's nothing to replace the train, of course. "
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. The train is generally "loss-making," that's no secret.
Ukraine Diary: Dreams and self-baked vodka
Ukrainians are not considered safe to drink for nothing. There is local beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't tell a big difference in taste. The same goes for the vodka, which is widespread. They burn here above all on the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a staggering 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here just how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that one should be careful as a tourist with it. But that's only true if he goes into mass sales. There is probably also adulterated.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and Drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer after work, you will find great restaurants in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glow for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favorite win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweeper master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Cup sprint of Oberhof. But there were two glimpses of light in the fog.
As much as the Federal President also made an effort, from the VIP stand on Saturday was not to recognize whether the windows on the shooting range really fell. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile and referred to the fog that kept moving into the stadium, which severely affected the view on the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, got numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier had won gold in the first race, the biathlon fascinates me," he revealed and praised Oberhof also for its modernized sports facilities: "The retreaded arena is great and offers ideal conditions. That's what the athletes say - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the World Cup was awarded. " Also in terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades."
Athletically, once again the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö escaped the competition. Despite a penalty after a shooting error, he secured the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23: 21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Cup title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round / 39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1 / 43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters were unable to intervene in the battle for the medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting error and with a gap of 1: 04.8 minutes as best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished 12th (1: 14.6). Two glimpses of light behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedict Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed use on Wednesday, the Black Forest left five discs this time and disappeared as 55th deeply disappointed and without comment in the cabin.
Bö had entered the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility. However: In his last two standing shots he had the luck of the good guy; they each landed on the edge of the windows and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year older brother: "It is the best feeling to stand with him here," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the finest athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's pursuit. For the women, on the other hand, the German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. 'if you start at number one, the goal isn't to come in as a tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one, "took sports director Felix Bitterling his" locomotive "in the duty. The organizers expect for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 clock / ZDF and Eurosport live) an almost sold out arena.
Brych dislikes'swarm of bees' on court
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on refereeing ball.
Aggressive players or grumbling coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanship. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Germany's top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in togetherness on the pitch. "I think that there are new behaviors of the players who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old of the German Press Agency. "We discussed that during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to that again - and we will sanction it. "
Recently, two coaches had been considered with place references. The Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "Even the coaching behavior falls into the area of ​ ​ unsportsmanship. We noticed that unsportsmanship has increased in this area as well, that the behaviour towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. Even such unsportsmanship we want to punish consistently, "said Brych.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a basically good togetherness of coaches and impartial. "Overall, the ratio fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent backlash. That's what the person concerned has to live with. That should not be anything earth-shattering, "said Fröhlich the German Press Agency.
"From the emotionality can arise in the course of the game quite conflicts. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal vilification, then you have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by referees, "said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the participants would have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be important if a rethinking process were to start altogether that such a behavior just does not belong," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible repercussions at another level. "Of course, events from professional football always color off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently responded to negative behaviors, "said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent rule interpretation in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combine Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country race of the Norwegians Jens Luraas Oftebro before the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves of Estonia.
The German combined drivers do not compete in the Black Forest in best numbers. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not included. They are preparing with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will take place from the 21st. February to 5. March in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that, "said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.

Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about building defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible building defects after building collapses during the earthquake. Arrest warrants have been issued for 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused should be responsible for building defects that would have favored the collapse of the buildings.
The prosecutor in Adana also investigates, according to Anadolu, because of possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
By early Monday morning, a magnitude-7.7 quake had shaken the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another magnitude-7.6 quake at noon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left-wing group in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old had died in the night of Saturday. Group leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED official and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," said the left-wing group in the Bundestag on Saturday. The party thus loses "a significant personality," said the group leader Dietmar Bartsch and the former faction leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first. Secretary of the district management of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on the 13th. November 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the Volkskammerwahlen on 18. In March 1990, the SED / PDS lost power and Modrow lost office a month later. He followed as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The leader of the Left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist." Bartsch added:
"Until old age he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be lacking."
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was just a special merit of him. That will remain his political legacy, "Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It also states:
"His later work in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS was always to represent also that part of the former GDR population, which was not wanted and whose interests were regularly injured."
After reunification Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As it says in a report of the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow has seen the new state "quite critical." German unity had been accomplished too quickly, the GDR had sunk too unconditionally, and too one-sided it had been condemned as an "injustice state," Modrow criticized according to dpa in many interviews.
What happened at night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Selenskyj condemns Russian rocket attacks. However, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's energy network. But Ukraine, too, is attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydropower plants have been damaged, said the head of the utility Ukrererho, Volodymyr Kudrytsky, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. It looks particularly bad with the power supply in the Kharkiv area. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block at Khmelnytsky nuclear power station had to be shut down, and production at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants was cut back.
President Volodymyr Selenskyj condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj doesn't want to abandon small town of Bachmut
On 24. February will rule war for a year. Us President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine backer Poland just before the anniversary. The danger of Russian rocket attacks, however, also lasted in the night to Saturday. In the capital Kiev, air alarms were triggered late on Friday evening for the fifth time for the day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," said the military administration of Kiev area. Fighting drones of Iranian design were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa areas of the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Bund selects consultant for network company
Demands, among others, the FDP and the Greens from the election campaign to split them, failed at the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, they had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be in the future public interest. This means that it does not need to generate and pay off profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms should help the federal government to accompany this process. The rehabilitation backlog on the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very unpunctually. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this maladministration with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments needed to achieve this have so far been estimated at EUR 50 billion. According to recent calculations of the railway, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
World Biathlon Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone pinch me, please?"
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann-Wick. She would have slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited," the pulse did not come down when running in. "Such a race," and that at the home World Cup, "you can not describe that in words," she said. 11,000 spectators whooped to the booming pop music with Germany flags, caregivers and team fell in the arms.
"Enjoy biathlon," that's what she had planned to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started as the biggest, if not the only German medal hope away from the squadrons in the World Cup. Herrmann-Wick has become the only German to win two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she currently occupies fifth place. And even if the power density in the women in the top is significantly higher than in the men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, they had for this sprint victory but rather others on the slip.
Criticism of the government - Bishop sentenced to 26 years in Nicaragua
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators calling for Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. The protests killed more than 350 people in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Defense industry demands more orders from special assets
First armaments projects have therefore already been canceled, other projects threaten the same, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. Which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms, but can not yet be said. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at the present time," it says in a response of the Federal Government to a request of the Bundestag MP Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
Background of the falling investment amount are the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special assets, which the Bundestag had decided in June 2022, must bear the interest charges for the loans themselves. If these rise, so less money is available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the currently high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 1: 40 clock, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive left at the highway entrance Kupperzell in the direction Heilbronn on the highway. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, police said. During the turn-off process of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both accident participants said that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A review of the traffic light system revealed no complaint. Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be hospitalized. The two cars were damaged by a total of about 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart commemorates victims of earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of Feuerbach's Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria concerns the world. On Stuttgart's Schlossplatz, more than 200 people commemorated and prayed for the victims on Friday evening.
Many parishioners had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened earnestly and silently to the imam's supplication. In the prayer, the Imam Allah asked for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for help and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. Speakers expressed sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German on Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already come together in the donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Türisch-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind in Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be brought by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat plant - Ebersberg
"After the meal you shall rest or take a thousand steps." The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has experienced an unimagined renaissance. Because who thanks to home office not in the middle of a stone desert, but rather only a stone's throw away from the field, forest and meadow, now uses the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk to the fresh air. At least one could gain this impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 14 clock not only dog owners frolic.
One reason, of course, could also be that modern humans can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of optimal time slot use. Because why not on the occasion of a short march through nature from the long-unseen neighbor news from the settlement? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? It was also possible to combine work and private life in this way - who says that the appointment with tax advisor, lawyer or investment adviser can not take place outdoors? Unless there are foreign ears nearby, of course.
What can also be done well is the acquisition of natural materials. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands next to cheese on a table by the wayside. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid only if you do not think about the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. For example, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voice. "Too bad, we have unfortunately forgotten the money."
The disappointment can be felt, because you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you let the sympathetic chance acquaintance also know. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You certainly have a bag with you! " He points to the hood of the jacket, which has been thrown over quickly before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat inlay and on this midday short trip has become richer not only by a lamb back, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk is due on this day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
At around 9 pm, the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the county road in the direction of Hailfingen and came from a previously unexplained cause in a left turn to the right of the road, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a control post, crashed into a tree at the side and stopped a few meters away. The collision caused the driver to become trapped in his car. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. Emergency services took the seriously injured man to a hospital. As there was a suspicion of driving incompetence, a blood sample was ordered. At the Audi, according to police report total damage in the amount of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: Point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in the office of President of the US
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the tax authority IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the Ministry said in the decision on Friday.
Contrary to political practice in the US, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He fought back to the high court against a release. A prosecutor in New York has since received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a trial.
The issue to Congress is arguably more sensitive for Trump: There, the circle of access rights is slightly larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be released in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information is constantly coming out of Parliament.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and about their undermining of our security as president," Pelosi stated.

British felon caught after long escape in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted British drug criminal has been caught in Thailand. As the British Criminal Police NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the NCA's most wanted criminals.
The leader of a criminal group had fled, according to authorities in early 2018 before the start of a court case, in which he had been sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. This fits in with the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again." Whether this fits in well in the generally prevailing domestic science skepticism here is an open question. In any case, his humor fits very well with Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York as a stand-up comedian in 2019 for a year. But now he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what Wissenaft actually is and what it knows - and above all what not. Of course, Corona also occurs, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many are pushing ahead: What really matters? All this with a huge wink, unexcited and very ironic. And so are not only well entertained, but can also learn something.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device Battlezone is equipped with a vector or X / Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of an armored driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level there are rock pyramids and rock cuboids, which provide temporary protection to the player, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super-tanks, as well as nimble rockets, which are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended game. In addition, UFO's appear at periodic intervals. These can't attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score with a UFO hit. The Battlezone device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the Attraction Procedure, the Game Introduction Procedure, Play Abl on, the Initial Input for Maximum Results and the Self-Test Procedure. The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the controls and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game sequence is triggered when the pressure switch START is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the sound of the game becomes audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is finished. The game starts with slow moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or rockets by observing the text displayed in the upper left corner of his cockpit. For example, a hint may be: Opponent OF THE RIGHT. In addition, a point representing the enemy position is visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The top, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of vision on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he must be well targeted on the screen. In addition, the upper left display shows simultaneously the EGNER IN the fire area.
Temporarily, UFO's that fly over the battlefield become visible on the screen. These are safe missiles that observe combat and can eliminate neither the opponent nor the player tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the fighting and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated from both the player tank and the opponent tank. A shot down by the player brings that 5,000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are reached: 1,000 for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 for a rocket and 3,000 for a super tank. A super tank drives and rotates twice as fast as the player tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the player the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence. In addition, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and for another more difficult game design, the appearance of the rocket can be varied. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting option are shown in the figure.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of maximum scores, HE or YOU can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that by triggering a self-test, batifying the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or interrupting the mains voltage, the table with the maximum results is deleted. When deleting (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores are received with their initials and re-enrolled on the screen to challenge more players. Each score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his / her pder initials within 60 seconds, strokes are automatically written by the computer. After this, the device switches back to the attraction game sequence. Assembly
1. New Parts
The Battlezone device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shift lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer casing part, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper function of the switch contacts. Another change is the rubber centring bellows, which, like a centring spring, brings the control lever back and forth to the center position. The microshawls are now fastened with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. Atari'S X / Y game circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in an even and calm image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the extension of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. In addition, there is a console in the device, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players, so as to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Equipment inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Still, you should do some checking to round out the quality control. In order to be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be made: Note: Device not yet connected to the 220 V mains. A. Check the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wire harness connectors for correct and fixed connection. Connect any open or loose plugs with each other.
Note: Never forcibly establish plug connections. The plugs are provided with a forced guide, so that a correct connection is established. A plug connection twisted 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check plug connections to the game PC board for correct and fixed fit. (3) Note the production number of the device on the nameplate on the back of the unit. Check that the die-in production number matches that of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, Auxiliary PC PCB, Controller / Audio II PC board and TV monitor. A picture of the location of the production number can be found on the back of the cover page of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your specialist dealer for more service information. (4) Check all other main components such as power supply, control console and TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. A view through the player's sight glass shall be taken to check that the radar screen is also located in the bright orange circled opening of the cover. If the opening is not exactly centered, the cladding, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector connector on the PSU 1 (s. Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
Any PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Checking the system configuration
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the package. Using the DirectX Diagnostic Program, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements. To access the DirectX diagnostic program, please do the following: Click the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. Enter "dxdiag" in the text box. Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphics and sound card. Among other things, you can check if graphics and sound work properly by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
It can happen that other programs take over the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are started automatically when the system starts up. Such programs that are constantly active on their system are also called "background applications." In some cases, they may cause your program to hang or crash. This is why we recommend that you stop such background applications before starting the game. - If your system is running antivirus or crash guard programs, you should close or disable them before starting your game. To do this, locate the program icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable" "Close," or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also quit general background applications, as these sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to exit all unnecessary background applications." Cleaning up the system
Before you install software, you need to make sure that your hard drive works optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, defragmentation, and disk cleanup to make it all work properly. Then the chances are great that current games on your PC run largely without problems. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus also other applications that you otherwise use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help files to access the ScanDisk and ScanDisk tools. To inform error checking, defragmentation and disk cleaning. Using the Windows Help
1. Click on the "Start" button and select the "Help" option (or. "Help and Support") to call the Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. B. "Scandisk" (Win 98 / ME), "Error Checking" (win 2000 / XP) and "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup." You will then receive instructions on how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. So you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First of all, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturer:

Introductory WORDS ON DRIVING
The desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression that could push the world to its limits. It was an opportunity for me to open up new horizons. I came like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century. On the one hand, although I struggled with the still immature technique, on the other hand, I was aware that everything still needed to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be perfectly honest, the next ten years couldn't quench my hunger. I had the dull feeling that the video games exploited only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too much on "action" and forgot about a fundamental element of the human experience world: The sensations. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of expressing feelings. Although this could, of course, have been done in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can certainly create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on fighting vile monsters in dark corridors and balling on boxes to get ammunition, but has far more sophisticated and deeper content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer a game content without sacrificing the narrative or the interactive elements. I hope that both diehard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. Should you be more skeptical about video games, I hope Fahrenheit will help change your attitude toward that. May other developers also feel the desire to take this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled much of our lives, representing an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, which has forced us time and again to challenge many of the principles previously deemed incontrovertible. I would be happy if Fahrenheit - much like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also does not pass by without a trace. David Cage

Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with minimum credit 2) for 2 players. Try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering Sparx. The game is set so that a minimum required area must be occupied before you can start the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the timed Sparx are displayed by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional Sparx are released. In case of alarm, the Sparx become SUPER-Spartix and more aggressive. If, as long as you try to draw your area, your marker goes into a spiral of death, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross or return your own path. If you hesitate and don't complete your area, a fuse will be plugged in and your mark will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are available.
The QIX game is able to self-check, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls work properly. For more information, see "Service Program." The volume can be made at the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data / Sound PC board.

Service-PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches - located in the device -, the self-test button and the LED's on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The languages can be set with the help of the "Sub-Test" button. If the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. Deployment-Programming. This indicator can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, it can set a "maximum number of credits," which may be before the start of the game. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" button. By multiple pressure on the "sub-test" switch, the factory or If the lowest line (RESET line) is green, press the "Up" button. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the green appearing lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display until "High hit rate until now." This value determines the required number of points / hits that a player needs to enter his / her own initials (names) and the hit points on the screen. The "maximum number of credit" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, - if coin lock exists - the coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for one player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be placed so close to 99, so by throwing in a coin the credits cannot become zero if added over 99. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum Loans" to O. Other programming: "Number of games": Number of marks per credit
"Threshold": Height of the% number that must be reached to switch to the next pass
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Difficulty of the game process
"Tightening tone": At "0" no sound at stationary operation
For "1" sound even when stationary (animating sound) "table model": For "0" stand-up device
At "1" table equipment
The credits per coin are set on the "throw-in slot programming" display. High score program display (maximum hit rate so far "). The player's hit points and initials will appear, including the 10 next scores. The values are used to set the highscore that was selected on the previous display (setting from "back"). Pressing the "Up" button sets the initials QIX Standard. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Overall Evaluation." By pressing the "Up" button you can set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts over. The total number can only appear to 0 if the battery or plug connection W1 is removed, if the device is turned off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (Not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Loans paid: Number of loans given for eigwerfene (umgwertete Münzen). Loans granted: Number of loans given by the device. % Free Spins: Loans granted (Paid + Loans granted per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes, for extended or won play. % free time: Minutes won / minutes played per 100. Average playing time in sec: Minutes played / credits paid + credits granted
High score: Number where a player had enough high scores to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" button, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Slot programming / normal money setting. With the help of this display, the selector can select a standard coin setting or program another setting
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If you want a setting that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. After a single pressure, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changes the values that are not suitable. Once the setting is done, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. If pressed unintentionally, the default setting will appear. The values can be increased or reduced with the "Up" and "Down" switches. By pressing the "Test" button, the process is finished. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") says how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an associated slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus loan is issued. "Min coin" means a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used "0." CMOS MEMORY (Memory) CALL
When "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, which stores all programming, has failed. All values stored in RAM are reset to factory default. This condition probably indicates battery failure or failure.
Troubleshooting and SETTINGS
Start of test method. Print the "Sub-Test" button or the "Self-Test 'button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can start. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" button the next program is displayed. If a permanent test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. When the display "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the J 19 plug is removed, the memory (memory) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checktotal stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LED's. If the ROM checksum is incorrect, U 10 will be displayed first. If this test does not succeed, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking that the storage was correct. Led value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt with the above mentioned. Display holds, an error has been discovered. If the communication RAM fails during the video board test, the error may have been caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or error in the data board. To locate the error, remove data board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: Failure in U 3, U 4 or connected circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test has been passed, all memory locations will be set to their previous value. Led value: 00 0011 If the device with the above mentioned. Display holds, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the connected circuits and decoding respectively.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers will be checked for accuracy when read back. Led value: 00 0100 There is an error when this value is displayed. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by inscribing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrolments are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, notice the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not show a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), the next check will be started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor shall be in place and it shall be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That's also the reason for star No 1. The 2nd for the right jacket to arrive without any visible seam defects. But I guess I was looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. Had oriented me on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she should sit so tight and I did not want to fight in my bust in an S or M. In the end, she would have fit in length and at the hip. In the rest, I could swim. In addition, the feed material already met when opening the package and distributed everywhere. Just a pity. It will be returned: /
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered her for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and she fits the 36 in this case quite well and will certainly be worn next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the edition does not quite fit. But what is my mistake. Have then slightly changed something so that it fits. The pad looks very robust and you do not damage the edges anymore. You can use the groove or the whole area. Worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy again right away.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product in itself I'm okay, but not under a year. Because the area to chew is much too big for the small mouth. We brought him when our son was 7 months and he could not use him for greatness. Now at 12 months old we've been looking for him back out and he can use him. Has also not been able to bite on anything with his already few existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it calms him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / unfortunately goes back
I have let myself be dazzled here by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I would like to say in advance that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has finally become too small and I need replacement. At Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can not say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at far higher prices. Guys, that's just not true! I really hoped that it would be, but there can be no question of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not provide such protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more laborious. Overall, the haptics of this backpack can't be compared to my Lowepro. Also the rice closures and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly high quality. So I decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment of many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to take the money for a reasonable backpack in my hand. Quality seems to come at a price. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not that I've had a hard time making the decision either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked a lot is the color inside. Here you will certainly find his things much faster than with a gray inner life. For someone who has other demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, the electric series of E. L. Todd best liked, however, my opinion was revised with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also recommendable and had really been looking forward to the third part. The part goes all the time around the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything and is then in every dispute like a little child and warps?! At the same time there were disagreements, my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor's ex and did not believe him when he said Taylor would stand on him and try to convince the ex that Taylor could not without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping that was the last part of the series and I think that part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary at the same time. I will still read the fourth part and hope that finally comes out, that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is the ex of Volt. That would bring more tension back to history.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn to do so! First of all, the film is not sooo bad now, as many write. Sure, of course the story is totally constructed, and conceptualized again and again according to the same schema F. When you've seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn to do so! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How many times have I thought about the film (and although I know it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there often shoot you tears in the eyes. That's why Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is already really neat. It's just a pity that humans just don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream movie. We consistently destroy the animal and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves to do so. Out of greed and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: No indication. 4 stars, because the film is well done, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Still, well-made popcorn cinema.
A quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is above all "French" - besides, it is quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and do not expect anything from it that he does not want to be.
Problematic
Taste like quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that does not matter. 5 Days every morning a parcel: Nothing has moved, but nothing is pure. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times daily. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate weaning, diarrhoea has remained for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, with the larger full 5? That is very strange!
Terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint in a chocolate brown, in February / March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed directly that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out a roughly chestnut brown (a bit darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the manual even with not satisfied result. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like the first try. Worst of all, it still stung weeks after application. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't disappear.
Highly Recommended
I now take the tablets for a long time and always take one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time because of my work, too little exercise and even a longer additional illness. Since I wanted to help my immune system not only by healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 something on the jumps. This also works out in a very good way. I feel fitter and substantially more comfortable. I better sleep and get out of bed. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not quite perfect!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems over time to "connect" to the mobile phone. This means that the "Power On / Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds. If you remove the mobile phone from the case and install it again, you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this creates a new deficiency. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the mobile phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it loosens itself from the cover, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although these are not many gross defects, I think that a case with battery should work perfectly in its function and therefore, for the cost of 30 €, I am very disappointed with the product, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I do not know how all this good evaluation comes about. In the end, it is actually an eyeglass cleaning cloth, which you get with every optician in a slightly smaller form gift. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I have promised myself much more of these cloths it is really very thin. Since I have used it I can not exchange it unfortunately I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far exceeded more than 2 euros one should not give.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I shcon fell into the shower), gives bass as bass again, Bluetooth works great. Of course, you have to water suction cup, otherwise it will loose. it can play sound very loudly. Yes. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is played as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played back very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the song are already almost hurting in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are grade enough audible. My old speaker didn't play bass well as bass, but the frequencies were pretty natural in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to pull off a star. I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
At a few places the color was chipped off and if you just went over it with your hand, the color went off to some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we did not want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our cost. they would only replace the damaged parts but as if both chest of drawers were damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did it all for us and transferred the money back to us. A LOB to Amazon
Better spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Supplied are individual parts which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't fault it as I desperately needed this product. The supplied adhesive hardly lasts, but sticks properly - like chewing gum, which does not get hard. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least this was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything is glued together. The stencils are partially incompletely punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high-quality product.
Am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closing + beautiful optics + stable when set up + shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors pop through magnets (you may be able to compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean places
- supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no other and did not have them since there was no cup in the house, glued with craft glue) - the mounts for the inlay shelf shake something (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If he would not look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give less stars, since you have to make everything suitable to be really satisfied. In addition, I find him a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes me.but
.There are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect I would have forgiven 5 *. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly (if at all!). Also the additional plastic waste (individually packed s.photo) means for me a star trigger. I hope the manufacturer changes this and will soon collect full points.
Go to the alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: The natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud. I couldn't turn them down, either. Probably a defect, supposedly that's possible. The quietest radio setting was too loud for me too, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time comes and the sunrise simulation started, it was too bright for me immediately. The colors and also the color change I found nice, unfortunately you can not dim the colored light. I also found it good that he has a battery so that in the event of a power failure, the clock and the wake-up time do not have to be re-entered. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light great, processing insufficient
I replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a board laughs at me at this point. There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - get 4" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled that coolly and quickly, but I did not realize that until after the return deadline. So I see that as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for two stars deduction. The light in itself is great. The rooms are now illuminated very bright and evenly. The light color is more in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry etc. For living rooms, I would personally resort to warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do that too and maybe I get there also intact copies according to the order. If my evaluation is helpful, I am happy about a positive evaluation. Questions I try to answer quickly.
Great
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I thought for a long time whether I order this set, or not. * * The material is stable and it lies well in the hand. * * All the utensils have a hole on the handle to hang them * * The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating. * * They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. * * You also do not forward the heat and thus can be touched directly. * * However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swipe and they're gone. Finally I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-goods sold as new goods
Amazon Prime shipping simply tip. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, tap unpacked and all parts checked. Here we found that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we have had to detect considerable scratches, abrasions. The fittings / connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that even on the chromed faucet itself scratch marks / streaks can be seen. This part has probably been delivered before and sent back again. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it does not matter how it looks. Our conclusion; Never again we order such goods via Amazon but rather spend something more in the hardware store where we get decent goods. Just find it sad that customers are so screwed up!!!
Product in itself top, outside sensor unfortunately already broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, there are no problems with the transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values ​ ​ outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be still intact, here plausible values are still displayed. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because there are always completely astronomical values ​ ​ of the outside air humidity displayed. This is a pity, because the device was placed on the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt of delivery stand today still blithely drives Hermes through the republic without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with the triggering of a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived at me quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and it gives a nice cut picture. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the catch basket is a big shortcoming. For one thing, it's only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom, and fabric in between. If you drop it off completely only briefly, then of course it is compressed and parts of the content fall out. Worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator shows already at half full catch basket on red. That would not be so bad if the mower did not lose large parts of the cutting material from then on. Always emptying the basket with a large lawn area when it is half full can not be the solution now. So I cleaned the device as well as I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, which is unusable for me due to the unfortunate construction of the fishing basket.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly constructed. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to save the battery. For the following reasons I only give 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed quite fiddly again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened nevertheless the hotbed is still too high and in the front right the screw falls almost out, because it is not tightened at all, although the hot bed is nevertheless still too low. The bars that hold the car are straight as well as the table too. Maybe someone knows what you can do there, because that makes it impossible to print something out. To set up: The setup was quite trouble-free you could only show how to lay the cables because you otherwise have to reinstall them several times, which is very hard. I have already written support but after a week of waiting I still did not get an answer. Unfortunately, sending back is no longer possible. Had expected me a little more.
Robust and precise I am positively surprised
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to come here. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so that you can start right away. The packing of the slider is simple, but fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full score for it and believe he will last at least as long as the old caliper. From mit there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, durable smell
Bought the bracelet and did not wear it for the time being as it exudes a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell is not gone, although it was constantly "aired." After return no longer possible, I have disposed of it. Rate from purchase
For the price ok
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me personally, so it seems quite massive. The larger sphere is freely movable, which I find quite beautiful. However, the chain as a whole is very easy to work with, so I have already torn open the closure two times. So far I have been able to fix it again and again, but I think that will not last long. But for the cheap price you simply can not expect anything really high-quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't work out, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more cuddly. Only: If you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after a few players. if you stick to the instructions, it does not work at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station and had re-inserted, the transmitters have finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about it did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all for me so not to use! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase anyway, brings only trouble!
Transport Damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off. I only bought them again for one reason, I urgently needed them because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the drain would fit. I hope that the shaft at the previous pump had a production failure and the current pump performs its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing cracked and the vents broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than using just a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
You could have thought better. Since I often deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than running around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. At first, everything went pretty well. However, the paint went off quite quickly and the screws always had to be pulled back. Nice that this also goes with a penny coin, but also only with a cent coin. I did not find a suitable slotted screwdriver that would not have ruined the whole screw immediately. To get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: Attaching the keys. Nice is that you can use the different parts, the screw on different sizes respectively. Can set lengths, but if you have screwed the whole then first, you need a pair of pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw in the thread is broken off during the third time mounting and thus the whole thing is useless. Conclusion: If at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the given dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material looks robust and all in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first Organizer Set), I will only be able to assess the goods after the first use. First of all, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can not really imagine packing everything there, for example, for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should be noted that not 8, but 10 pieces were delivered, because in the round cosmetic bag two smaller bags / bags were included. Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and consists of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. The price - performance ratio I see as a tasting price and that's ok.
So Lala
So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas too. Now, when I wanted to use him again, he didn't. Battery? Exchanged. But he still does not work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can as well.
Care is always good! The application is easy, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I could not hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. Battery life is long enough. Definitely completely sufficient sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wearing and are therefore very comfortable. The earlobes are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price category.
Chic dress
Very nice dress that is well wearable for a variety of occasions. Price-performance is in full agreement here, especially since I also bought it in the flash offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I am glad that I did not order it smaller (was recommended). I would only have liked the neckline not to be so deep, and the sleeves could do with a little more fabric (if you do not have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Finger away. It does not get any worse. I really and seriously didn't expect such a scrap to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a High End Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It can be assumed that the USB connections provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually works, Blu-rays are detected as unreliable as possible. The discs have to be inserted several times, then Rödel makes sounds like you have not heard them since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because there is nothing left or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or just anything. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, there is of course no Blu-ray software included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it should, but is not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually eye candy, because only the port that points up is a USB port. The other plug is only there to charge any devices and thus relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and had I just needed a grubby extension I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump of gold plugs. But apart from optics and my misjudgment, the extension performs its service very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not just dangle around in the area, as with a normal extension cord. So no real bad buy, but my euphoria is limited: -).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters which I had to send back unfortunately could not. Practical is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous loading is not a problem. Sound is supplied via HDMI. For what else do I use my PlayStation: P There was a small adapter with which can be attached to the tablet. This should bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, that doesn't fit with the adapter. Well keeps so safe and has contact from that. All in all somewhat expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, very small the whole and made stable in an aluminum piece. Price performance fits.
A lot of performance
Top device. Has been running without problems for months. Is not exactly light or quiet but brings neat performance. I find the central position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool and am therefore always on stage 2 on the way. Has also fallen several times on the tile floor and has survived well. And I like the simple design too. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has made a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We have been using the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the tracking is felt to be accurate to 0.5m. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump once by a few meters, which is not disturbing. Would buy me him again any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently he lasts about 1,5h days. Here a solution would be great which would create 7-14 days. Although there is an XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not have to last with us and change daily we find also impractical. You should deal with the dog not with his collar: -). The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education, the sole breaks after a few weeks and the shoes can not be used anymore. With the last couple it was also in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought for the lesson it will be enough. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke down after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. These here are unfortunately poorly processed at first glance. Comfortably, they are just like the ones I owned before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but at second glance, you can see that the edges are poorly made and that the strap on the heel is quite loose and very likely will not last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them for good luck. The mattress and a car air pump were included. To the mattress: I have tested them in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that this one does not show up again. In the inflated state, a lying test was carried out directly. It fits well on it and fits perfectly to the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace your own bed, but for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Before that, we took out the seats at the back. Thus, it fits perfectly. The Air Pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress needs two different adapters, which can also be found at the pump. The pump is put into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was broken (something at the soldering point). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and reassembled the good part worked excellently and pumped up the mattress in zero comma nix. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm then curious about the endurance test at the festival. I hope that she will not lose any air and will last a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not appear again. After the test, I can definitely recommend it before. If I have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than €10. Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me.: (1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the ludicrous processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On 21. There were no doors left at all and I had to allow more or less my son to take out the remaining parts because they almost already liked him. The parts often get mixed up, which often means that you have to disassemble the car to install the parts. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Most of all the windshield. This can also be very badly reattached.) In itself, I would no longer buy this calendar and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers will reconsider the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and make it better.:\
A real drone
I'm thrilled with the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. Inside it flies very well and the 5 min. Flight time is usually enough. The hair gets jammed in it and the drone breaks very quickly, I did not expect anything else with the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. Nice contact if you have any questions.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. Did not see when buying that it is not a game CD but only a code with which to download the game. That would be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is an impudence. Since then, the computer is constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery's running time
I had been really looking forward to the clock. Design and look great, messages etc were displayed easily. Service worked well. and yet I send them back. DRR big hook: The battery and its running time. Charged in the evening, only on the closet overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of news during the day, the battery was already at noon / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time. Therefore for, me not usable. Very bad.
Noble shell with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10 + you should definitely get a cover. I recently liked cases in which you can also plug the credit card. This is what the case offers here. If you plug in all 3 compartments of cards, it becomes too much, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. She looks classy. The mobile phone is embedded in contrast to many other cases around, only at the connections are recesses. Otherwise you can use on-off switch and volume control on the sides well through the cover. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the cover. Even on the QI charging station made of leather by TORRO it does not work. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be loaded when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well processed!
High quality shell with bulletproof glass foil
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass to protect the screen in a classic design provides all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily reared. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not pollute. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some hold. It's not too bulky and is firmly on the phone. Overall, a good buy.
