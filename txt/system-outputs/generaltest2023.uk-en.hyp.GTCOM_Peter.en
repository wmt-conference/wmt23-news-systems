And, if you can, pray for us, naming all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
These are our names. "
A Letter of Occupation.
Kherson.
"Natasha, we are holding on with all our might.
It feels like they're scared.
Are very much afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat several times that they are big, that they are strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and our heads spin - how are you, ladies, afraid if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat this greatness.
How you are not sure of yourself.
It's like sexual intercourse with an impotent person, who needs to be told endlessly that he is strong, that he can do everything, for a very long time and stubbornly for him to try and at the same time think when this painful abuse will finally end.
We repeat it in order to keep us all safe.
Because it is very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless body with a machine gun.
Because later, when this evil is driven out of our land, we will have to organize the city.
No matter who we are talking to, we all have the same words.
The words that the city smells of rot.
We will probably need a lot of detergents just to wash sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were large.
Three healthy men undressed her and left her on the street, forbidding anyone to approach her to help.
For three hours she stood undressed on the street and only spoke loudly:
"Don't come near me, my dear.
Do not put yourself in danger.
Please, please!
We will still have a lot to do with you.
Then!
And more to come.
They are stealing.
They are stealing everything.
It's hard to believe they don't steal.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting from children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because leaflets are constantly being put up in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the ZSU.
And when they are close, the Kherson people will deal with impurity with their bare hands and teeth.
They are feeling it.
So there's a rush.
And we will wait.
Let's wait and see.
Let's clench our teeth, clench our fists until our fingers are numb and wait.
Because we have something to look forward to.
To be once and for all.
And none of this uncleanness remained.
And then we'll wash the city.
For a long time.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, naming all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
These are our names. "
The author of the written for obvious reasons is not specified.
And I need communication. I have scattered quite something. I know that few people want to communicate with sour people, but I still do not lose hope
How satisfied are you with the housing?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same profession as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar questions are now being mapped out by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs as part of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The findings will help to better understand their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
All those who provided a functional e-mail when requesting humanitarian aid will receive an invitation to the survey (from the address invitation @ click4survey.cz).
The questionnaire is filled out by everyone only once!
By filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
Technician IN THE PRODUCTION
, MECHANIC IN PRODUCTION
We manufacture electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics or modern medicines - none of this would have happened without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues to our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities to both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I would like to say a few words about this.
There is a great desire to gather with the residents to discuss important, exciting issues, but the assembly is prohibited by law, because there is a war in the country.
I will be grateful for sound advice and any help in my quest to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are a force.
Together we will overcome all adversity.
Together we will win.
So reach out.
I will listen to everyone.
I will be infinitely glad and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the conditions for the payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all arriving Ukrainian refugees are entitled to a first aid payment of 5,000 kroner without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
In order to receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation - be considered unemployed, have no property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice as follows:
1 Ô∏è ‚É£ The first payment of assistance will cease to be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily multiple meals and hygiene supplies, he will not be able to claim a payment of 5,000 kroner.
The authorities will begin to believe that basic assistance was provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and there is no need to pay money.
This measure is designed to solve the problem of Gypsy refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for the sake of financial assistance.
2 Ô∏è ‚É£ as before, only those refugees who prove an immediate need (lack of work, etc.) will have the right to cash payment of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth benefits.
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå as in the first point, only those Ukrainians who were not provided with free housing, multiple daily meals and hygiene equipment will be able to receive financial assistance;
üìå the applicant must actually live in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary in order to stop the practice of "tourism for the sake of help," when a refugee lives in one country and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days solely for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address in the application form for the payment of benefits does not match the address indicated in the database of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she really lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the payment of assistance will be denied.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion crowns on the payment of humanitarian aid.
And today I spent the whole day digging up defensive structures, and the whole city is being dug in, some not very happy predictions for the near future.
Honestly, I am tired, it is very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, for this someone needs to organize equipment and people, and I am the head of the village, so these are my duties
All utility companies are involved, and we also appeal to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We must unite, because otherwise we will not overcome the Katsaps
Very much propaganda so that people lose faith and weaken the resistance
Honestly, I haven't picked up a shovel today, I hope I won't have to
My children put girl stickers on my phone case so that I don't forget that I am female
What will happen if the bill passes?
‚òò Ô∏è A government commission will be created from representatives of the Office of the President, some ministries and business associations, which will quickly review the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
‚òò Ô∏è The Commission and other executive authorities will review all permits for doing business in most areas by the end of the year.
And they will suggest which of the permits or procedures need to be removed.
‚òò Ô∏è The Cabinet will remove all "unnecessary" permits and procedures in an accelerated mode.
Without any public discussion, behind the scenes!
‚òò Ô∏è It will not matter if the decisions of the Cabinet contradict the current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of economic activities that may harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
‚òò Ô∏è Business regulation by the state will be based on the principle of "one new permit - minus two old ones."
Whether or not it will make any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
‚òò Ô∏è Behind the scenes, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents regarding permits or procedures in the field of the environment.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc., will be under threat!
‚òò Ô∏è Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We will not even know how and who changes the by-laws until the final decisions are made.
‚òò Ô∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the opportunity to influence are business associations.
Bill No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Short deadlines for reviewing permits, an opaque procedure, the absence of any decision-making criteria - this is a movement somewhere to the east, not to the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support
They told her - grandmother, the Russians came to the village; Grab your cat and climb into the beads.
But she refused - what am I, an old mare... Save the children and girls, I will stop here already... Grandma goes down to the cellar, shovels cucumbers, rolls away a tub with junk, a pile of troughs; There are doors with iron bolts and silver locks.
And behind the door someone rattles the chains.
I did not think - says the grandmother - that I would live.
Seventy-odd years - and again the rod.
Go - just not to the cities, because, damn it, you will bring us closer to "Putin kaput."
The grandmother's cat hisses, the glass cracks in the windows.
Tanks rumble and move between houses.
The Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Good afternoon, go to the mail and confirm your identity through "check-in," then upon confirmation you will be given a code, and you must specify this code again in the online registration and you are ready.
A bank card must be registered for the person who wants to receive financial assistance, another is not suitable.
I did this to an acquaintance, it also indicated that some kind of key was needed, but when she stood up, waited in the government office, they told her why she had come because she was already registered.
It also showed her, in this application, that some kind of key is needed, but in fact registration is already taking place without it
Help me too, the application was issued online on May 5, but something is not in fashion to understand whether to go to the labor government or wait
It is written that you will receive money on the card after processing your application, but it says that the identity has not been confirmed, the banking system issues an error
Good afternoon, dear Mrs. Angelino!
I want to express my point of view regarding the use of "in" / "on" in relation to the word "Ukraine."
The use of this term in recent decades has become a serious political issue.
Today's war of Russia against Ukraine was prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy
Thank you for the interesting exercises and tasks, for the clear explanation of grammar, pleasant communication.
We are especially grateful for the technical support of training, first of all, for the textbook, which made it possible to understand what was sometimes not learned in lectures.
These three months laid the foundation of our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish all the creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions, he popularizes world classics in the Ukrainian language, including "Lolita" (V. Nabokov), "Perfumer" (P. Siuskind), "Sin" by M. Kotsyubynskyi, "Letter from a Stranger" and "Wild" by S. Zweig, etc. (Etc.).
The works that he initiates are not easy to perceive, they require the investment of soul and heart.
The author deliberately brings the audience to deep feelings and tears.
In his opinion, tears are cleansing, this is the way to the recovery of modern man.
Has a range of awards.
In 2005, he received the title of "People's Artist of Ukraine," Laureate of the Taras Shevchenko National Prize of Ukraine (2007), but most of all, Mr. Mykhailo appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate.
Connoisseurs of Mr. Mykhailo's talent hope that after the end of the war they will again hear him play the saxophone, see his unsurpassed ability to reincarnate, and be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art
Minerals of Ukraine
By origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Therefore, their placement is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
The fuel minerals mined in our country include: Hard and brown coal, oil, natural gas, peat, oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully meets its own needs for hard and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we have a rational economy, acute shortages can occur in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissia.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, farms, and at enterprises of the glass, porcelain and faience, and food industries.
Various chemicals are also obtained from peat, in particular acetone, phenols, paraffin, fodder, yeast.
There are considerable deposits of oil shale in the Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions.
The geography of the placement of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, therefore they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as in the marginal foothill depressions.
Hard coal.
94.3% of the coal deposits of our country are hard coal.
Ukrainian hard coal is of high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine, there are deposits of the best grade of coal - anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1 / 3 of the coal is coking.
After special processing, it is used during the smelting of iron and steel.
According to the explored reserves of hard coal, Ukraine ranks 8th in the world and 1st in Europe, and according to production, it ranks 11th and 3rd, respectively.
Explored coal reserves in Ukraine amount to about 50 billion tons.
Estimated reserves are about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write "messages" on shells that are dropped on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
Thus, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the Eurovision stage to save the military blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol - and the very next day the Russians wrote on the shells "Kalush, as you asked! # on Azovstal."
The missiles that the Russian military fired at the station in Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022, read "For the children."
Then 61 people died from shells with a cynical inscription, including 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared during the First World War.
During the Second World War, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies.
Then it helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on the shells by the Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they don't like the political course of Ukraine.
Russia must be stopped so that such "messages" do not fly to any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing met us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
"We take insulin, it needs a temperature regime - it cannot heat up.
Is it possible to pass the control in an accelerated mode? "
The border guard allowed us to stand at the beginning of the queue, even the trucks graciously gave way.
Lvov
The city of the lion is alive.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body - an endless stream of people.
People from all regions of the country have found shelter and a sense of security here.
Someone goes further to Europe, someone returns home, someone stays.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at roadblocks around the city.
The war is reflected in the dictation-filled windows of cathedrals.
She wraps monuments and sculptures with white canvases.
But the war cannot be heard on Rynok Square, where thousands of voices sound at the same time, nor can it be heard in coffee shops and bars, where people continue to live.
Yes, life subsides earlier - at 11 pm, life hides from the curfew.
But it is there: When we were sitting in a cafe at 9 o'clock in the evening and announced the alarm, it could only be heard from a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpin
We paved the way to Kyiv through two of the many martyr cities - through Bucha and Irpin.
Cities are heroes in which the air smells of hope.
Despite the pain, people come back and rebuild their lives.
A private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Is it a bullet or a machine gun?)
On the shattered balcony there is a Ukrainian flag stretched.
Near the front door there are holes, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
There are three of them at the front door.
They clean, repair, build a wall and with it a new life.
And a mother and child are walking in the park two blocks below.
I can't help but ask myself: "Did their dad survive the shootings of men in Bucha?
Are you going to walk with them? "
On the way out of Irpen there is a car cemetery.
These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and which were ruthlessly shot by the Russian occupiers.
This cemetery has already become an object of a kind of "patriotic tourism."
If you go deep and stand surrounded by autoskeletons, you can feel a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slowed air, such an impression that it can be cut with a knife.
And it's already been weeks since the deaths of the passengers.
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.
And in one of the cars - an abandoned bicycle, in the other - a warm children's overalls.
Somewhere a booklet with instructions for using the airbag was not burned.
The remains of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
We drive on, I look around for the last time to look at the city - and my eyes come across the same bridge under which frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, but it was on these broken plates that the Ukrainian military carried a child in white.
This kid in the white jumpsuit probably survived.
But is there a chance that the child who was wearing the clothes abandoned in one of the cars is also alive?
A man sits on a broken bridge, a camera over his shoulder.
He just sits and looks at the chasm between Kyiv and Bucha.
He doesn't take pictures, he just looks.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge, and thinks: How is it?
"Happy holiday!" - exclaims the man joyfully to us. - "Happy City Day!"
On May 29, military Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Mykolayiv
A hero city, an outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A front-line city that the occupiers still cannot capture.
And we believe that they will not be captured - the city is fighting and living.
On the street corner, at every second intersection, there are neatly stacked piles of tires and Bandera lanes.
Evening Mykolaiv is now incredibly quiet - the noise against which the city lived has subsided.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And it's extremely dark at night.
Light masking for safety.
People live "by candlelight," more precisely, by the flashlights of mobile phones.
At home, we turn on the light only in the kitchen - quickly and as needed.
Grandmother covered the windows with heavy blankets, through which the light does not penetrate.
There is a hunting rifle by my sister's childhood bed.
"On hand since the 24th," says the father.
When there are air alarms and sounds of explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in a front-line city, it is very difficult to live in a mode of constant anxiety.
When then to live?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers from the city, shots from "pions" reach the Zhovtnevy district, cover Kulbakyne.
Several times I fly close to my relatives.
On the next block, across the street from us.
To the neighbors of the grandmother - the grandmother's windows were blown out, the children took them to themselves, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of the Ingul and Central districts.
Life goes on.
A siren is howling on the central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple is sitting on a bench, talking about something, calmly discussing it.
A bicyclist passes them.
We are watching with dad - what will we do?
"Well, shall we go get some coffee?"
So we are sitting on Sobornaya Street (the former Soviet Street, by the way) in the park near the monument to St. Nicholas.
And what else to do?
To be honest, when a siren catches you by surprise on the street, there is often nowhere to hide, there are no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every Mykolaiv citizen.
On the lawn near the entrance lies a huge trident - once decorated by the ODA.
Now in the place where the trident flaunted itself, there is an empty "nothing."
Just like in the place of the office of the head of the Regional State Administration and a dozen offices around.
The missile landed squarely on Kim's desk.
The war takes on a completely different shape when it is not in the news, but under your feet.
I walk through the corridors of the ODA, and with every step I hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor - someone submitted requests and statements, but now it does not matter.
On the table of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag.
On the bedside table is a flower.
They took her home, transplanted her, let her live.
We met a security guard who was on duty on March 29.
Survived.
"Patched up, sewn up," he points to his head. "Already at work."
Only journalists can get to the ODA.
With us are a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, direct inclusions, interviews.
According to official figures, 36 people died.
This is "September 11 in Mykolaiv," "a monument to the Russian measure," comments the press attache of the regional head.
The Mykolaiv regional state administration is just one of the wounds on the body of Mykolaiv.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even when Denmark helps restore the Regional State Administration, Mykolaiv residents will always see a terrible emptiness in it.
Russia has launched a new "gas war."
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transport system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped supplying gas to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May - to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline.
Official Berlin expects that Russia will cut off natural gas supplies through this route as early as July.
Such blackmail was used by Russia in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
Gas has always been not just a commodity for Russia, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the first priority is the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West.
Financing the economy of the Russian Federation is donations for the Third World War.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and trying to quickly diversify gas and oil supplies.
But in order to become energy independent from Russian energy, the EU needs time.
Meanwhile, the Putin regime is intimidating Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and lack of heating in homes.
Countries in Europe, especially dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may feel its shortage.
But this crisis will stimulate a more frugal attitude to natural resources and increase energy efficiency.
Europe will win when it gives up Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
Temporary discomfort should be endured so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia is burning crops in Ukrainian fields.
The army of the Russian Federation uses incendiary shells that destroy ripe crops of grain and oil crops.
Russia is spreading hunger in the world.
Due to the Russian war, the number of people in the world suffering from food shortages may increase by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, the Russians steal already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, and block sea exports.
The destruction of the agricultural potential of Ukraine is another manifestation of the military aggression of the Russian Federation.
Thus, Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world.
More sanctions are needed against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital Affairs launches an innovative hotline format - the Diya.Business virtual center.
Forced migrants from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registering their own stay, registering a business, finding a job and receiving assistance.
Therefore, the Diya.Business virtual center is being launched in order to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format until Ukrainians can return home.
It's scary how you have to be afraid of every important day, and how you never know a day or a minute that may come
Good afternoon, Anna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician back and ask when the next time you can come for a vaccination for Darusi.
They were supposed to be tomorrow, I can't come because the battery in the car needs to be replaced, it will be there by the end of the week.
The neighbor brought a cable and we charged from Marina's car.
But on the panel of the car writes, you need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia has to bring it from Ukraine, and then it will be replaced for me
I will try to start the car tomorrow, if it works, we will go alone, I will leave my grandmother in the car and will not turn off the engine.
If I do not start, then I will write to you and you will come for us
I am very uncomfortable to bother you, distract you from work.
Okay, let's go with you at 11: 45, so as not to take any chances.
"The war is not over yet, and the fates of our new neighbors are also becoming our reality.
We hear stories about escaping to a safe place, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure journey they are embarking on together in order to put them in hastily loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all adults who still do not quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
Stories of children for whom the only memory of home is a toy that they could cling to during many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, the organizers emphasize.
At the end of each trip is a return to a safe house.
But this trip is different, scarier.
That trip isn't over even after more than eight months.
A return home is anticipated.
The theme of war is ubiquitous, so our gait may seem superfluous.
On the contrary, in the face of increasing antipathies and hostile sentiments in society, which are stirred up and exploited by populists, we want to note that involuntary travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in poetic form and thus apply for participation in this holiday of Czech civil society.
They are now part of it. "
Despite such a painful topic, the parade still managed to be bright and encouraging.
Masters and craftsmen contributed to this, who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, reels, houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade went from Kampa to Vaclavak, and at each stop a huge performance was played, the dramaturgy of which was developed by the Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to preserve the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians are facing now," says the playwright. - Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects normal life, which is interrupted by an air attack.
To the rescue, the glowing birds come first - they cover the children with their wings in the first place.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of protecting wings becomes even more relevant.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song widens the column.
And all creatures came back to life: Sunflowers, reels, toys and even houses.
Such is the symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who has helped and is helping Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we will be able to overcome this difficult path and safety will prevail in homes. "
The wife sends her husband to the market for snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, the man meets friends and gets drunk for three days, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he mentions snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
Thinks to tell his wife why he's been gone for so long.
He rings the doorbell, spills snails on the floor, his wife opens it, he, pushing them with his hands, says:
- Well, here they come!
We go in, we go in, we go in.
Our editorial staff talked with the Ukrainian refugee Marina, who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.
"Now I am trying to realize myself as an artist," the Ukrainian woman said.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, concern for relatives.
In a conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, there is confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she found herself with her children.
But the woman believes in her strength and is trying to adapt to life in Prague, without abandoning the idea of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Marina comes from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children - a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect at the State Nikopol Institution.
"By education, I am an architect of buildings and structures, I graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Before that, she studied at an art school, graduated from a lyceum with a degree in "artist-decorator," "Marina said.
And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina, without thinking twice, left Ukraine with her children.
Prague became a refuge for a woman.
"Of course, it's a new city, big, crowded... A new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs say to me.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
In addition, I am not ashamed to ask for help from the Czechs and have never felt any aggression from them.
Thank you for this, "Marina shared.
According to her, people who have been living in Prague for a long time helped her in solving issues related to finding housing, obtaining a visa and insurance, and submitting documents for benefits.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the garden
After receiving a tolerated stay visa, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
"Of course, I want to find a job in my field.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands..., "she said.
"They didn't take us to kindergarten because there are no places.
They say that it is necessary to look for adaptation groups for children, and no one knows exactly where they are.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She wanted to help me find a place in kindergarten for children, calling a number of different authorities, but., "Marina continues.
"In general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and naughty.
I can't say that the children bother me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to safely attend Czech language courses.
Once I went to a Czech class with the little ones, so they played a little, and then they started to behave restlessly.
I, like a normal mother, was distracted, could not study normally... If there were language courses for adults with children or with small ones, someone would be there during the training... But my daughter is so attached to me, "the woman sighs.
"Of course, together with our children, we go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which we are very grateful to the Czech Republic," Marina added.
When the children sleep, Marina engages in self-education, learns Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
One day, Marina was looking at vacancies on the Internet and saw an announcement: "As part of the initiative of the Association" Spolek Zaedno "with the support of the EC representation in the Czech Republic" 12 stars for Ukraine, "we are organizing a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.
Only creative imagination is required from the participants. "
Marina could not help but take advantage of this opportunity.
"I took courage and applied for participation.
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we painted all day.
I didn't sleep, I was worried.
In addition, I have not taken a paintbrush in my hands for six years, "the Ukrainian woman said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists.
"The theme of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use the Ukrainian theme in our works - we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.
Therefore, the collection of paintings is dominated by blue-yellow colors, "Marina added.
The event was attended by 30 applicants, of whom only 12 were selected.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings will be held in Prague with their participation with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic.
"This is how life is.
All your once-acquired knowledge and skills can come in handy, and also support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic, "Marina noted.
"I'm trying to be real as an artist.
Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
But we have to do something, "the woman said.
Marina owes the Czech Republic for its hospitality and friendliness, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.
Active hostilities continue in the south of Ukraine.
Residents of temporarily occupied and front-line settlements continue to leave for safer areas.
On September 1, the academic year began in Ukraine.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will need a lot of time to fully recover from the full-scale war started by Russia.
However, Ukrainians are not waiting for better times, but have already begun to clear their cities and villages of Russian garbage, rebuilding infrastructure.
The Kyiv region took the brunt of the blow in the first days of the full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital and capture it in a few days.
These cities and villages experienced active hostilities, atrocities of the Russian army, and in some places - occupation.
In early April, the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksandr Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after active hostilities and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are rebuilding their homes and public space.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia began a new stage of this war - information.
The Russian Federation is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce support for Ukraine from the international community.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces fight the aggressor, and thus become complicit in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report: The Ukrainian military is equipping positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure facilities.
At the same time, she ignored the fact that it is only about objects from which the civilian population has been completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to information attacks of the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia attacked Ukraine, seizes its territories, kills and tortures the civilian population, destroys cities and villages.
The Russian Federation is guilty of the war, it has no right to any actions on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and knock the enemy out of the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine stand against Russia on all fronts!
I am sure that every person in the world has ever dreamed of their perfect home.
Believe me or not, I'm no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.
It would be next to the beach and have a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I will definitely be happy to live in the heart of picturesque landscapes.
My house would be a two-story cottage with a wonderful exotic garden in front of the house, and there would be a lot of different flowers and fruit trees.
I will also have a garage for my car.
By car, I will be able to go to work, shopping or just travel with my family wherever our eyes lead us.
In my ideal house there will be at least six rooms: A bright and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, an office with a workplace and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with bedside tables and chests of drawers.
In the office there will be many interesting books in bookcases.
The living room will become the most visited place in the house, where the whole family could get together, share news or just have fun.
That's why there would be a large sofa with small pillows, several armchairs, a chest of drawers, a huge TV and a long built-in aquarium.
In addition, my ideal home would have a loft where we can make a home theater or entertainment room.
There would be a pool behind my house with a few hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we could do exercises every day to keep fit or just play various team sports such as volleyball, basketball, football, etc.
My ideal home would be big and cosy, lovely and beautiful.
I would really like to live in it.
But this is just my dream... I have to make it come true.
Hello, how many men should there be so that I know which room to prepare? Is it alone?
I gave the letters to the secretary to you
Yes, of course, I ask how many they are so that I know where to settle them
Of course, you tell me right away what I would know
To have time to clean the room
Also tell me how you can send a parcel to Ukraine, my daughter-in-law is due to give birth on the 6th and probably needs our help, she is now alone at such a time, I can't leave her without support, she is my only granddaughter
The groceries, the diapers.
I'm just going to bed on June 6 for conservation.
I was released from the hospital for only 10 days.
I didn't have time to buy everything for the child.
There's still no bedding, no blanket.
So they should know, I hope they will find the main thing is not to panic, because now I don't know what to do, I am ready to go and search for myself, but they won't let me go to Donetsk, there is heavy fighting there now, and I don't know how it will be with the search, it's hard
So the last words that I heard from him were that I am a worker and it's good that I took my sisters and brothers and that they are safe
I have to hold on, children are what keeps me going, they are my hope and support, I have nothing but them for me, they are everything, I am happy that I have them
My whole body is numb, I don't feel anything good at all, even though I can walk with me, this has never happened before
So thank you, I can't go there today, another time I need to calm down and gather my thoughts a lot

How football teams from Ukraine and Russia fought in Turkey

FC "Minai" claims that this is a fresh photo from the last training session after the fight with the Russians
In Turkish Antalya, a conflict took place at a meeting between the players of the Ukrainian football club "Minai" from the Premier League and the Russian "Shinnik."
The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams accidentally stayed.
Initially, Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict that occurred on February 13.
The fight was then confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC "Minai," the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
It seems that one of them was drunk and clung to a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight really happened, but already on the floor where the Russians stopped, and in equal formations.
The number of victims on the part of "Shynyk" only confirms the fact that the Russians are still "throwing" their own, "the statement says.
The club states that after the end of the clash, the Russians continued the fight among themselves, the local police had to intervene.
"Before the start of the meeting, the main requirement of FC Minai to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams from the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to accommodate "Shynyk," "the statement reads.
Football journalist Roman Bebeh, who was one of the first to report on the situation on Twitter, posted a photo of the Ukrainian player who defended the employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that the Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Baza telegram channel writes that representatives of "Minai" approached the players of the Yaroslavl "Shynyk" and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians have denied this.
"The numerical advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our guy.
Jericho stood up for him and stood up for him.
There were five or six of us, there were much more Ukrainians, "a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"The Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, among the injuries are a dissection of the lip, a fractured toe and a suspected bruised rib," Kommersant writes.
"I don't understand where Ukrainians could come from in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine there," said Serhiy Kulakov, general director of Shynyk, in a comment to journalists.
Subsequently, Kulakov told the Russian agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but emphasized that they were not being evicted, they decided to leave on their own.
How to lose weight Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian.
And what is the medicine for diabetics
7 minute (s) ago
Injections, which are gaining popularity, help to lose up to 15% of weight, but have many side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy weight loss injections, which are used by some famous people, in particular Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in type 2 diabetes.
Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience in social networks, admitted to using it.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes can really contribute to weight loss.
By affecting specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, a person is less likely to feel hungry, get full faster and consume fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick solution and not a miracle cure that helps you lose weight without any effort.
Treatment takes place under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and physical activity.
Like any medicine, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or upset stomach, bloating and gas.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to loss of facial fat, and in some people - to sagging cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
Doctors called this effect "Ozempic face," from the name of another drug for the treatment of diabetes, which is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors advise taking Wegovy for no more than two years.
The USAF regained some lost positions

In some areas of the front, the Armed Forces managed to regain previously lost positions and gain a foothold there.
This was stated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhnyi during a conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhnyi, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk direction, where the Russians carry out up to 50 attacks every day.
Fierce fighting continues in the area of Vugledar and Maryinka, where, according to Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces of Ukraine reliably hold the defense.
"Despite constant enemy pressure, we continue to keep Bakhmut under control and take measures to stabilize the front line around this city," Zaluzhny said.
In a conversation with General Milley, Zaluzhny shared his concern about Russia's use of sea-based surface drones, which poses a threat to civilian shipping in the Black Sea.
After capturing Soledar, Russian troops continue to squeeze the ring around Bakhmut.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut is "developing successfully" for his troops.
On February 11, in the evening briefing of the General Staff, it was said that Russia was strengthening its grouping of troops in the Lyman and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and on the night of February 11, the Russians attacked critical infrastructure of Ukraine in several regions.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from six o'clock in the evening on Friday until midnight, Ukrainian air defenses destroyed two dozen "Shaheds," which the Russians launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile strike on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

The EU will strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
The European Union will introduce new sanctions against the Russian Federation on the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of an extraordinary EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU would support Ukraine "for as long as necessary."
The chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kyiv with the greatest financial support.
"In the supply of weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone in continental Europe," he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized "public tenders under the motto: Battle tanks, submarines, aircraft - who will demand even more."
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda will benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

In addition, the German Chancellor once again emphasized that, despite all the assistance provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not become one of the parties in the military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue to closely coordinate with partners the supply of weapons to Kyiv.
Scholz recalled the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022, about support on the way to European integration.
At the upcoming extraordinary summit, the EU countries intend to confirm their commitment to Ukraine's European path, he emphasized.
Ukraine belongs to Europe, and its future is within the European Union, the chancellor added.
An extraordinary summit of the European Union will be held on February 9-10 in Brussels.
One of the main topics will be Russia's war against Ukraine.
According to Reuters, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will take part in the summit of EU leaders.

Metzola called for giving Kyiv fighter jets and long-range weapons - DW - 09.02.2023
The president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, during a meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, spoke, called for the provision of aircraft and long-range weapons to Ukraine.
"EU member states should quickly consider, as a next step, providing the long-range systems and fighter jets you need to protect the freedom that many take for granted," Metzola said.
According to her, the response should be proportionate to the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union," she said, addressing Zelenskyy.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow the Russian Federation to destroy the European way of life
Zelensky, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on the way to EU membership.
"We are getting closer to the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
A winning Ukraine is a winning member of the European Union, "Zelenskyi said in his speech to the MEPs.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself against "the most anti-European force in the modern world."
"They are trying to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life with a total war.
But for what?
To destroy the European way as such after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of the 27 elements of the European way of life, 27 countries of the European Union.
We will not allow this, "the President of Ukraine emphasized.
Zelensky will ask to speed up the delivery of weapons
The day before, DW reported that Zelensky arrived in Brussels to receive the support of the European Council and speed up the provision of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As the source of the publication from Zelensky's advanced diplomatic team recalled, during Zelensky's visit to the United States at the end of December last year, Kiev received "an agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support voted for by Congress."
"Therefore, the president of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally goes to other capitals," the interlocutor said.
At the same time, the diplomat noted that, "of course, such decisions are not the business of the European Council, but the decisions of the member states."
It is expected that Zelensky will voice Ukraine's needs for weapons during the European Council summit and talk personally with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member states.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine primarily needs long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia launched a major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the west of the region has increased markedly over the past week, according to a February 8 analyst report.
It is also noted there that geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed Russian offensive successes in the Dvorichny area northwest of Svatovo.
The Armed Forces do not allow the Russian Federation to achieve significant success
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces are so far preventing Russian troops from making significant progress.
The ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full momentum, the Russian command has not yet activated parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after being deployed in Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in Luhansk region now have the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces set the terms of battle, ending the period of Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final culmination on the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions," the report says.
According to analysts, this culmination is likely to create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces, which they can use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning briefing, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Russian troops, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive operations in five directions: Kupianske, Lymanske, Bakhmutske, Avdiivske and Novopavlivske in the areas of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Maryinka and Vugledar.

The day before, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, suggested that the new Russian offensive, which is predicted in February, may take place not only in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but also in other directions.
"Of course, there will be attempts to attack both in the Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia directions," he said in an interview with Reuters.
"How successful they will be depends on us."

SpaceX limited the ability of the Armed Forces to control drones via Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
The adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Mykhailo Podolyak, on Thursday, February 9, called on the American company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kyiv in the war unleashed by Russia.
Thus, he reacted to the information that Elon Musk's company limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
"Companies have to decide for themselves: Either they are on the side of the right to free life and Ukraine - and then they do not invent how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its" right "to kill, seize territories," Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink is not meant to be a weapon
The day before, SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army is actively using to counter Russian aggression, "was never intended to be used as a weapon."
"However, the Ukrainians use it in an unforeseen way that is not part of any agreement.
We know that the military uses it for communication, and this is normal.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes, "Reuters quoted the director as saying.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could "limit their ability to do this."
"There are things we can do and have already done," she added.
Exactly what measures the company took, she refused to specify.
SpaceX "bargained" with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX transferred Starlink systems to Kyiv for free to provide the population with Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue financing Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over the issue.
Then she estimated the necessary funding by the end of 2022 at $120 million, and for the next 12 months - about $400 million.
The issue of financing was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, as well as in the European Union, but soon the owner of the company, Musk, said that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US Department of Defense to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that relations between Berlin and Kyiv against the background of Russian aggression are developing "in waves" - they have "ups and downs."
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
By nature, I am a fast person.
Others act more slowly, which may also be related to their bureaucracy, "Zelenskyi said, adding that in the conditions of war, Ukraine does not have weeks or months, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every moment.
Revitalization with air defense
The President of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage the "conservative attitude" of Germany changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally received support from Steinmeier (President of the Federal Republic of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I had difficulties before, especially because of the so-called" Steinmeier formula, "Zelenskyi said.
He stressed that "good work" had been done, which made it possible to change relations.
"We received IRIS-T air defense systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives, "the President of Ukraine noted.
According to Zelensky, Berlin managed to increase the pace of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T complexes to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with the tanks
However, the debate around the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kyiv has returned relations with Germany "to a difficult phase," the president of Ukraine noted.
He called the discussions on the matter "emotional and difficult."
"I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is not needed by us, but by the Europeans," Zelensky explained.
Categorical about fighter jets
After the allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kiev with battle tanks, discussions began about the transfer of fighter jets, which Ukraine insists on.
Here Scholz took a categorical position: Germany will not transfer combat aircraft under any circumstances.
At the same time, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv "as long as it is necessary."
He made relevant statements after meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of leaders of the European Union countries on Thursday.

A new prime minister has already been nominated - DW - 10.02.2023
The government of Moldova, along with Prime Minister Natalia Havrylytsia, resigned.
This decision was made after consultations with the country's president, Maya Sandu, Havrylytsia reported on Friday, February 10.
"After a year and a half of working in the government, it is time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, fight against corruption and integration into the European Union, "she said.
According to her, during its work, the government "faced energy blackmail."
"They thought that we would surrender and act like previous governments that betrayed national interests, but it was not so. We worked in a continuous crisis mode," Havrylytsia emphasized.
She did not specify the reasons for the decision to resign, referring only to the lack of "support and trust at home."
Sandu thanked the prime minister "for her tremendous sacrifice and efforts," also noting that Havrylytsia led the government during a period of crises.
"Despite unprecedented challenges, the country was managed responsibly, with great attention and dedicated work.
We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and bankruptcy, "the president of Moldova said.

The Secretary of the Security Council may become the new Prime Minister
According to the law, the Cabinet of Ministers will continue to perform its duties until the new government is sworn in.
To replace Gavrilica Sandu, she has already proposed her security adviser, the current secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and the former minister of internal affairs of the country, Dorin Rechan.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, in which the "Action and Solidarity" party has a majority.
Havrylytsia was her representative, so voting for Rechan should not be a problematic issue, the AFP agency notes.
Rechan has already said that he plans to continue seeking Moldova's membership in the European Union.
According to him, the priorities of the new government will be "order and discipline, breathing new life into the economy, as well as peace and stability," writes Reuters.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.

What are dangerous aftershocks?
Despite the fact that due to sub-zero temperatures in the region, there is less and less hope for the rescue of people, rescue work continues.
Thus, 102 hours after the earthquake in the south of Turkey, a family of six people was freed from the rubble, the state news agency Anadolu reports.
A total of 166,000 Turkish and foreign rescuers, police officers, medics and volunteers are involved in the rescue work.
Of these, more than eight thousand rescuers are from 61 countries.
In total, 97 countries have sent aid to Turkey, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
"White Helmets" in Syria criticize the UN for lack of assistance

In Turkey, almost 171,000 tents were destroyed in the region affected by the tremors.
According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets were transferred to the crash site.
At the same time, in Syria, representatives of the non-governmental organization "White Helmets," which carry out a rescue mission in regions controlled by rebels, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a representative of the "White Helmets" said that only two small international teams of volunteers who do not have rescue equipment arrived in the region to provide assistance.
In addition, according to him, no humanitarian aid from the UN arrives in the region.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which works in London and reports on events in the rebel-controlled northern regions of Syria, noted that one batch of aid from the UN had arrived in the region the day before, but it lacked shelter tents and equipment for disassembling rubble.
About three thousand volunteers of the "White Helmets" are involved in the rescue work in northern Syria.
According to their data, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people were found, more than 3.3 thousand people are considered dead.
More than 10,000 were wounded.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
In the early morning of February 6, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 occurred in the southeast of Turkey, as well as in the north of Syria.
This earthquake was the most powerful in almost a century of observations.
The last time Turkey experienced underground tremors of such strength was in 1939, when about 33,000 people died.
In less than 12 hours, the southeast of Turkey was shaken by a second powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.5, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

A decisive round of presidential elections is taking place in Cyprus - DW - 12.02.2023
In the Republic of Cyprus on Sunday, February 12, the second, decisive round of presidential elections takes place.
He left the ex-minister of foreign affairs of the country, Nikos Christodoulidis, and the former permanent representative of Cyprus to the UN, Andreas Mavroyanis.
Conservative politician Christodoulidis received 32 percent of the vote in the first round, while his opponent in the second round, Mavroyanis, who is supported by left-wing forces, gained 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling Democratic Union Party (DISY), Averof Neofita.
The DISY party, after the defeat of its candidate in the first round, could not decide whom to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, the AFP agency notes.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal suffrage.
He forms and heads the government of the country.
The winner of the current election will hold the post of head of state for five years and will become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of a coup supported by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the northern sector of the island occupied by the Turks proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Ankara.
The last negotiations on the attempted reunification of Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots - about 560,000 people - take part in the elections.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote on them.

Energoatom announced a new threat to the ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
President of Energoatom Petro Kotin called the Russians' reduction of water in the Kakhovsky reservoir a new threat to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).
"There are a lot of threats to the ZNPP.
The decrease in water in the Kakhov reservoir is a new added threat, "Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the level of the reservoir is 13.8 meters at a normal level of 16 meters, "so that the station receives power for its generators, for turbine capacitors and for safety systems."
"In recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and is rising slightly, because it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m," Interfax-Ukraine quoted Kotin as saying.
He explained that the Russians, who control the locks at the Kakhovskaya HPP, began to discharge less water, while at the same time the inflow at the top of the Dnieper increased.
The president of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at the ZNPP is sufficiently full and there is still enough water, but in case the level of the reservoir drops to a critical point, this, according to him, "will be a big problem for the ZNPP."
Kotin emphasized that the critical level will be 12 meters, the emergency level - 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will prevent a critical situation.

As Interfax-Ukraine reminds, by order of February 10, 2023, the State Atomic Regulatory Service banned the operation of power units No. 3, 4, 5, 6 of the Zaporizhzhia NPP at power levels due to the impossibility of eliminating the detected violations of nuclear and radiation safety requirements.

Near the station, shelling of territories is also recorded, as a result of which the buildings of the ZNPP are damaged.
The Russian and Ukrainian sides accuse each other of this, there is no independent data on who is shelling the ZNPP.
Israel will intensify the campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to step up its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, February 12.
"The government is meeting today to prepare for an even broader response to those who commit terrorism," Netanyahu was quoted as saying by Reuters.
This statement followed a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
The attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
Police shot and killed the man at the scene, and also arrested and questioned members of the Palestinian's family.
Israeli law enforcement officers sealed the doors and windows of the Palestinian family's house.
The next step after sealing may be the demolition of the attacker's house, AR writes.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot dead during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired a rocket towards the Israeli border on Saturday evening.
The Israeli army said that the missile was intercepted, reports dpa.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army has been conducting near-daily raids in the West Bank, leading to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported killed during them or during their own attacks.
In addition, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman died as a result of Palestinian attacks in 2023.
According to human rights activists, about 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022, making this year the deadliest in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, over the past year, 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis, AP writes.
Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, dpa notes.

The head of the Greek Foreign Ministry visited Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece, long-time opponents, writes dpa on Sunday, February 12.
On the same day, the foreign ministers of the two states, Nikos Dendias and Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu, held an unexpected meeting, at which, as the cameras of Greek television recorded, they even hugged.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
√áavu≈üoƒülu thanked Dendias for Greece becoming one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the natural disaster.
He added that both states will try to start a dialogue again and solve their problems.
"Greece's assistance to the Turkish people does not end there," the head of the Greek Foreign Ministry emphasized.
According to him, Athens will "do everything" - at the bilateral level, as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit a natural disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the region of Antakya and Hatay.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
Political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope for several days that the assistance provided by Athens to Ankara can be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members have already shown solidarity with each other during the strong earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This assistance, known as "earthquake diplomacy," helped to achieve some d√©tente then.
Conflict over the islands
Athens and Ankara have been arguing for decades over sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean.
Ankara questions Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos and Kos.
Greece seems to be violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous landing ships on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
Read also: Greece and Turkey on the verge of armed conflict?
Turkey almost daily reinforces its claims by flying fighter jets over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country's leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Ankara's warming ties with Armenia
Against the background of the tragedy caused by the earthquakes, there is also a warming of relations between Turkey and Armenia.
Ankara opened a crossing that had been closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia for those affected by the disaster passed.
In addition, Armenia reported sending two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake that occurred on February 6 and claimed the lives of more than 33,000 people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are tense due to historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War.
As the legal successor of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits that it exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide was condemned, in particular, by the United States, Germany and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the background of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation only became more complicated.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers began in Brussels, within the framework of which a meeting in the so-called "Ramstein" format is also being held on Tuesday, February 14.
On the agenda of the event is the further increase of support for Ukraine in the war and the increase in the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting that NATO should provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war."
"We do not see any signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensives and new attacks," Reuters quotes him as saying.
"This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics," Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations on the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.

During the meeting, the ministers are expected to approve long-term methodological recommendations for the Alliance's defense planning.
"Allies will discuss investments in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure," Interfax-Ukraine quotes Stoltenberg as saying.
What to expect from the ninth Ramstein
On this very day, the US-led Contact Group is meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, in which the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksiy Reznikov, is taking part.
Also, the head of the Ukrainian defense ministry will join the special session of the meeting of NATO defense ministers.
"More than 50 countries participating in the Contact Group are united with you in this struggle for the sovereignty and self-defense of Ukraine," Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of the meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership previously expressed hope that at the next Ramstein meeting, the partners could decide on the provision of Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that, based on the results of this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of the provision of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants a ban on the tour of Russian artists in the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine collects data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine or work in institutions and organizations funded from the state budget of the Russian Federation in order to include them in the new package of EU sanctions.
This was announced in an interview with DW by Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Halyna Hryhorenko.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
As Grigorenko emphasized, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum very clearly says that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation, "Grigorenko says.
In her opinion, dialogue through culture with Russia is impossible now.
That is why Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, the deputy minister of culture of Ukraine explained.
Thus, recently, the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DNR" in the Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour
However, according to Hryhorenko, this is not enough, and those representatives of the culture of the Russian Federation who support Putin's policy still manage to tour Europe.
"In order to officially cancel such tours, you need to have names on European sanctions lists," Grigorenko says and adds: "We are working to ensure that cultural figures of the Russian Federation who promote Russian narratives outside of Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts, on the territory of the EU. "
According to Hryhorenko, the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group under the Office of the President of Ukraine are dealing with this issue in Ukraine.
As previously reported, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, at a joint press conference with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9, noted that he asked her at the summit in Kyiv to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of cultural and media figures of the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 names.

The US is ready to sell HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment to Poland for $10 billion
The US State Department has approved the possible sale of military equipment and services to Poland in the amount of about $10 billion.
Voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin reported this with reference to the Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
These are primarily launchers of the highly mobile M142 HIMARS artillery missile system with ammunition for them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such an acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe," the Agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and deter regional threats."
In general, Poland submitted a request for the purchase of the following equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of the HIMARS loader module;
- 45 Army Tactical Missile Systems M57 (ATACMS);
- 1,514 capsules of the GMLRS multiple launch rocket system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
Also included in the agreement are missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, personnel training and equipment, system integration support, engineering and technical and logistics services for the US government and contractors, training, sensors, other related elements of hardware and software.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is an addition to the launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw also invited missile launchers from South Korea, the publication informs.
NATO Secretary General called on the United States to be ready for a long war with the Russian Federation in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine for protection in the war against the Russian Federation has not been removed from the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
'the first step in providing advanced aircraft is having soldiers or airmen who are capable of using them.
It's a process that takes some time.
We started this process today, "Sunak said about the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
"Nothing has been taken off the agenda, and our leadership on this issue is something we should all be proud of together."
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks would arrive in Ukraine "next month" and said that Ukraine "must never again be left vulnerable to attack," and also called for "arming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term."
According to him, Great Britain agreed to expand its training program, which has trained 10,000 military personnel over the past six months, and promised, as CNN writes, to "accelerate the delivery of our equipment" in order to ensure Ukraine's achievements on the front line in the coming "days and weeks, not years."
During the press conference, President Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: "Today it is clear that we have the support of Great Britain.
Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity. "
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he once again repeated the call for the provision of Western fighter jets to Ukraine and added that he "heard from Mr. Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighter jets" to Kyiv.
The Russian Embassy in London has already said that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military and political consequences" for the whole world.
Now, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kyiv continues to talk to Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: "I spoke with Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra to coordinate our international steps, as Russia's full-scale invasion approaches the one-year mark.
I thanked you for the last decision regarding tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation. "
The spokesman of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Yuriy Ignat, said in a comment to CNN that Ukraine will need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say that the West has a short period of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the start of the expected new Russian offensive in the spring or even in February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin is already trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since the beginning of January.

"Politics and profits" stand in the way of vaccination
The director-general of the World Health Organization said on Sunday that if countries do not effectively use existing tools to fight the pandemic, it will not be possible to end it.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the necessary tools - effective health care and effective medical tools.
But the world has used these tools badly, "Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries around the world.
The obstacles to meeting the WHO's goal of vaccinating 40% of every country's population against the coronavirus are "politics and profits," the WHO chief said, "not production."
"Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue to COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Fund," Tedros said.
COVAX is an international cooperation initiative created for the equitable distribution of the COVID vaccine.
Ghebreyesus also emphasized that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperation to protect other peoples.
Together! "- said Ghebreyesus on the social network Twitter.
The WHO official also urged vaccine manufacturers to "prioritize and fulfill their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African Vaccine Acquisition Fund]" and become "much more transparent about what goes where."
AVAT is an initiative of the African Union aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to "share know-how, technology and licenses and waive intellectual property rights."
Earlier, Karen Attia, a contributor to The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share the Moderna vaccine "recipe" with the world.
'the US administration has trumpeted about the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, this is not good-hearted philanthropy; it is arrogance.
Poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they asked for a fair opportunity from the beginning, "the columnist noted.
"We are not asking for charity," Tedros said, "we are calling for smart investment in global recovery."
As "Voice of America" reported, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the waiver of patent protection for vaccines against COVID-19.
Such a refusal should, according to the plan of the US administration, allow poorer countries to produce analogues of patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, etc., opposed it.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center reported Monday that it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
Nearly 7 billion vaccines have been administered, according to the university.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the decision to send F-16 aircraft to Ukraine will be a "very serious decision" that is "not easy to make."
This was stated by one of Ukraine's closest allies in an interview with the CNN television company against the background of discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
According to CNN correspondent Laura K√ºnsberg, in Warsaw, in an exclusive interview that will air on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16s will create a "serious problem" for Poland, because the Polish Air Force has less than 50 aircraft, and the Poles themselves "do not have enough. and we will need much more."
Duda also emphasized that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have a "very serious need for maintenance," so "it is not enough to just send a few planes."
These remarks by President Duda were made against the background of discussions of new deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, including Western tanks and anti-missile systems of greater antiquity.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has been pressing its NATO allies to send Patriot systems and Western-made tanks such as Germany's Leopard tanks to Kyiv.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an unannounced European tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with the means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelensky called combat aviation the "wings of freedom" for Ukraine.
Zelensky repeated the same message in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to the members of the European Parliament, Zelensky said that he was "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hoped that the next negotiations on the provision of aviation to Ukraine would also be successful.
"I heard from some European leaders about their readiness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
Now I have a series of bilateral talks, we will raise the issue of fighter jets and other aviation.
That is why we continue our work here in Brussels, "Zelenskyy said.
As Voice of America reported, last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to transfer its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said his government would consider Kyiv's request for the F-16s.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied the supply of F-16 aircraft from the United States, but Western experts believe that these aircraft may arrive in Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that previously, weapons that the United States refused to supply eventually ended up in Ukraine if European NATO allies agreed to transfer them.

Chisinau, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, the president of Moldova announced a conspiracy by Moscow to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country "at the disposal of Russia" and disrupt its aspirations to join the European Union.
The briefing by President Maia Sandu took place a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said that his country had intercepted plans by Russian special services to destroy Moldova, which Moldovan intelligence officials later confirmed.
"The plan for the next period involves the involvement of saboteurs with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will resort to force, attack some state buildings and even take hostages," Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate government of Chisinau to an illegitimate one," Sandu said, "which would put our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration."
She vowed: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed."
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought to forge closer ties with its Western partners.
In June last year, it received candidate status for the European Union, on the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several cases of organized criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence."
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a member of NATO, has faced a number of problems.
Among them are a serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply cut gas supplies; rapid inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed its airspace and debris that was found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said that Russia wants to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the special services contained what she called instructions on the rules for entering Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that state institutions are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control," Sandu said.
She said Moldova's parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the prosecutor's office, with "the necessary tools to more effectively combat risks to the country's security."
The president added that the plan would "rely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups," and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.
Last year, the United States and Great Britain imposed sanctions against both men.
Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shor party also rocked Moldova amid an energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday took place after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Rechan, as Gavrilita's successor.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, US State Department Deputy Spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova for years, often involving the use of corruption as a weapon to achieve its goals."

Maybe on Friday. The DOCTOR ASKED TO BE HOME AND TREAT Daria's ear.
I would like to talk to you personally, but we are at home.
Darinka's ear hurts, so we went to the hospital today. So we are being treated until Thursday.
Are you like?
I thought, if you need help, for example, I know that the kindergartens will have holidays from next week, stay with Nikita, if you are busy, you could stay with Darusia and Vanya for a while.
Stories from the war: "Grandmother with a red flag" threw him away when she found out about Bucha
An employee of the Center for Strategic Communications found the same woman.
A living symbol of "pro-Russian Ukraine," a woman who, according to the version of Russian propaganda, "bravely opposed the nationalists," is actually grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only support her with products, but also protected her from the anger of ordinary Kharkiv residents.
Anna Ivanivna explains that she went out with a red flag to, as she thought, the Russian military, so that they "would not thunder Ukraine."
And in the aggressor country, her motives were twisted, because of which she now feels like a "traitor."
She is currently staying in one of the city hospitals of Kharkov together with her husband.
üí¨ The military is urged not to disrespect the old woman.
"Now that Anna Ivanivna received a mine in her yard from the Russians, and help from the Ukrainians, her grandson is fleeing to Poland, when she found out about Bucha and everything else, she threw that red flag away," says a platoon commander from the pseudo "Cadet"
The enemy is creating conditions for an offensive on Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih - summary
The Russian military is conducting hostilities to reach the administrative boundaries of the Kherson region and create favorable conditions for the offensive on the cities of Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces
Literally: "In order to increase the pace of the offensive operation, the command of the armed forces of the Russian Federation continues to take measures to strengthen the strike potential of its troops.
Weapons and military equipment removed from storage in the Western, Central, Eastern military districts and the Northern Fleet are transferred to the regions bordering Ukraine by rail. "
Details: The enemy did not conduct active operations in the Volyn and Polissia directions.
There were no significant changes in the situation in these areas.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
There is still a threat of the enemy launching missile strikes on military and civilian infrastructure throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as provocations by the enemy on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine.
We refuse Soviet weapons and switch to NATO models - Zaluzhny
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny, held a telephone conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces
Direct speech of Zaluzhnyi: "We also discussed with my American colleague a promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will finish it.
I also informed General Milley about the difficult situation in the east of our country, in particular in the Izyum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, hold occupied lines and positions. "
"Whoever came up with this hellish summer was clearly out of his mind!" The wild plant complained and stretched out her hands in front of her, as if she wanted to reach for the ghostly coolness.
"You say the same thing every time," Varta remarked indifferently, stirring the ice in the cocktail. "In autumn - because it rains and it's foggy, the herbs rot.
In winter - because it is cold and the potion freezes.
In the spring - because it rains again.
"She would sit in her Carpathians," Varta shrugged her shoulders indifferently.
She didn't particularly like the city.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and fuss.
The girl liked to imagine the familiar streets calm, quiet and greener, like a hundred years ago or even earlier.
But there is no such magic that would allow you to return to the past.
- Pah!
You say that! - The wild plant slapped her palm on the table - and the vases with flowers timidly turned green. - You would sit in captivity with my grandmother Rutmera and her colleagues for a week, you would pray to every passing truck that you would just be taken away from there to any city.
Unless you loved to weed the beds from morning until night, pick herbs, hang them under the ceiling and at the same time sing old hymns.
Because the grandmother insisted with her horn that without words none of my potions would be the way they should be.
And wait, I haven't mentioned yet about picking up all sorts of junk at night!.
But where there, our Belarusian, you would have died, even a week would not have passed!
Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, and that they like such a "job," that it is their conscious choice, and so on.
But if you really start to understand this topic, it becomes scary.
Now the problem of involving Ukrainian women in prostitution is especially acute.
The problem is there.
Our current president even had the idea of legalizing prostitution... Because of this, I did not treat him very well.
I think that we need to adopt the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of "Swedish model" there.
In this case, they order not the woman, but the client.
Women are helped to get out of this "business" and make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees at all.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything anymore.
Men should also think about what they are buying - "pleasure" or violence.
There is a need for something else... You can show me where the nearest optician is with a doctor to write a prescription for glasses.
And the frame needs to be bought, high-quality... I looked at some sites with frames, and I was pleasantly impressed - it's cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $300 for them, the frame was of an average level (or even lower).
I don't know what frames are in stores, but the prices in online stores are quite normal.
But, as for some cosmetics, I can definitely say that it is more expensive here.
There's so much more.
Our multifocal lenses in glasses are very expensive (this is compared to our average wages).
Considering the budget of our family (especially the fact that we have to rent housing), $300 for glasses is quite a high amount.
Did the doctors not offer you an artificial multifocal crystal?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then intolerance to lenses began, another year after that I wore hard lenses, I began to have severe allergies to almost all cosmetics.
For 4 years I have been wearing glasses all the time, I rarely wear lenses.
Yes, I also read that Covid affects vision.
Also, after 40 years, there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than $1,000, then very, very expensive.
Yes, glasses are fashionable now.
I asked one doctor why he doesn't wear lenses or get laser correction, so he answered that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of UAH 1,500, this amount is unrealistic
I now have glasses to mask wrinkles
Yes.
My mother has little work experience.
She did not work much: First, young children who often get sick, then she took care of her grandmother... So the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father receives 3800 UAH, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8,000 hryvnias, and all these funds had to be paid for housing rent.
In good times (before COVID), there were premiums, but with the onset of quarantine, there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
Therefore, many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for their family or buy a kart, but then they lose contact with their family.
Yes, the pros are there.
But my husband has a day off, so he goes to the apiary)
Have a good night
According to the order from the day of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until the restoration of control over the specified seaports.
It is indicated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the impossibility of servicing ships and passengers, ensuring an adequate level of shipping safety and environmental protection during Russia's military operations in these regions, which pose a threat to people's lives and health.
The Russian Federation uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
As the correspondent of Ukrinform reports, Reuters writes about this, referring to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Great Britain.
"The British Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that Russia uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including Great Britain and South Africa, on social networks," the article says.
It is noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reached these conclusions on the basis of an expert study.
"The department said that this study revealed exactly how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign works, aimed at manipulating international public opinion regarding the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers," Reuters writes.
According to the study, the troll factory "used Telegram to attract and coordinate new supporters, who later acted against Kremlin critics, pelting them with comments in support of President Putin and his war."
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
"Traces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok," the report says.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on this occasion that her government had already "warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations."
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadowy troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war," Truss concluded.
Ivanna, I will explain to you now.
You have such a hair structure that all hair is almost the same length.
Very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest possible result, you need to do hair exfoliation.
But this will greatly affect the thickness of the hair.
That's why I didn't do it.
Or do root dyeing to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I also did not dye the roots.
Therefore, the transition can be a bit abrupt.
I can smooth the transition for you, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be painted to match your color, so when the hair grows back you will not notice the difference.
About the quality of hair.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
Hair can become drier, this is normal, because it is blond.
Without loss of quality, such a blond can not be done.
If you do the right hair care, the condition of the hair will return to normal.
Please write what kind of care from Matrix you use.
Maybe he's too blond for that.
We can sign up for free tinting to make a smoother transition.
This photo is also quite a sharp transition.
Because a large percentage of blonde in the root zone.
Please let me know when you can come by so I can take a look.
If we do tinting, it will take about three hours.
A lot of positivity from what I do at my job.
I help people - this is the most important thing and I wanted it.
Let it be in this way, but this is help to people to whom almost no one in the world helps and does not say "good afternoon" with a smile from the heart.
I found today on the Internet excellent basic lessons for learning the Czech language.
I clean the rooms here in the morning where the homeless sleep, at this time I am alone and the doors to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons in my headphones and repeat them after the lecturer.
From the side, I talk to myself, but it's good that at this time no one sees or hears me üòÖ I think I can learn the language like this for an hour a day.
So another huge positive of this work is learning the language in headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ
Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
Its longest period of peace lasted 12 years: Between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
He attacked 10 of them.
Most of the modern territory of Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural basis of Russians.
The cult of invasion and raids was successful throughout the history of Russia: In the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then - 20 years of Putin's regime.
These cultural features have formed state institutions that cultivate the politics of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of wars of aggression because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet fully felt the effects of economic sanctions.
Their standard of living has not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protest movements inside the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand stronger sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from the inside!
Russia poses the threat of a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military is shelling and seizing nuclear power plants on the territory of Ukraine.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was de-energized.
They fired from tanks and took control of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also recorded over the South Ukrainian NPP in the Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacking nuclear power plants.
A missile hit, overheating of the reactor or spent fuel due to failures in the supply of electricity and water can lead to a radiation leak.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
It is not necessary for Russia to press the "red button" to cause a catastrophe of a planetary scale.
Support Ukraine - the Russian threat can be overcome only together!
The Russians rob Ukrainian farmers and illegally export grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and the first crops from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a conscious policy of Russia: For example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory decided to "expropriate the surplus of last and this year's crops" from the south of Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take seed from farmers, but at the same time require them to successfully sow in order to then send new crops to Russia.
Prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, he threatens physical violence.
Russia repeats the USSR's policy of mass looting of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
This is how the Holodomor began in 1932-33 and private property on Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of a "liberation war with the Nazis," Russia, in particular, provokes famine in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country abandon any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine are taking children hostage.
They force their mothers to visit the locations of the Ukrainian military, and if they refuse, they threaten to kill the children.
People are being pushed to a tough choice: Lose their children or become traitors to the Motherland and suffer punishment for it.
The Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine, Lyudmila Denisova, has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphaned children by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated an amendment to the legislation "to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbas."
Call on your authorities and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don't like their indecision.
Due to the fact that NATO does not close the sky over Ukraine, thousands die.
More than 50,000 civilians have already been killed.
However, without Western weapons, we would be powerless, but I have to say that it comes in insufficient quantities and late.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think that this is beneficial for the alliance itself, because with weapons from NATO and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe
Did you know that a Ukrainian invented how to reload a "disposable" NLAW anti-tank system?
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage
The Russians deserve the worst and the worst that can be imagined.
So to some extent, I am happy with what is happening.
Because this war has not been going on for 4 months, it started around the 15th century, I don't remember exactly now.
But all these hundreds of years there is an attempt to make us their slaves.
No sooner has one generation died than another is born and takes up the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished, and now they have returned to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state
In general, it is wild for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the rapidity of events, I didn't even have time to think through, to reflect on the very fact that there is a war and what it means for me
It's great here, but I need to learn the language and go to work, I won't be able to sit on the maintenance of the Czech state, but the problem is that my husband doesn't want me to have constant quarrels at work. And I will have to return to Ukraine, or we could stay, but he will do everything for us to go back. very difficult situation
Doesn't want us to live here so his answer
Yes, he is glad that we are here, but in order to stay at home all the time, I myself took the children to school and swimming, I ask that we stay here after the war, and he says that we will go home immediately, he will not make us documents
I probably won't be able to leave myself if he has a long time to do, and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic
A lengthy beating
When the war ends, I want to study to be a hairdresser, and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic. If he doesn't want to, then he will probably have to go to a lawyer. It's too early to do anything now. But here he clearly told us that after the war we are going home right away.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine, he said he would))) well, now I know the truth
Yes. Thank you. We will get out of the situation, the main thing is that the war ends!!! Everything will be fine.!!!
No, at the moment he doesn't have anyone, that's for sure. I think the reason is that children in the Czech Republic want a lot of things, they ask him for toys or to go to McDonald's, shout, run around the house. And he is accustomed to peace, that no one bothers him and doesn't ask for anything lower. And here we came and everything annoys him and we have to spend money on us, and he is very thrifty. So it's better for him that we live in Ukraine.
Outside the window of the train, majorillas, dusted with a small gray rain, birch and fir trees, sprinkled with black and white confetti of magpies, mournful water carriers and freight workers.
Comrade Operative Orlrv lay on a narrow Spartan bed, familiar to him, because it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed at home.
He unwrapped an uncomplicated set of secondment - rye bread and lard wrapped in a gray rag.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and he was unpretentious in life, he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simply, because he did only what was useful for the country and the world revolution.
Then he bent over the old rusted bag and carefully took out with two palms the crystal dome, which sparkled dimly in the gray light of the middle lane.
"What is it with you, comrade?" The young cadet, his neighbor, asked in fright.
"A rarity," Comrade Orlov said with a tenderness unexpected for himself, securely placing the skull on the compartment table, "such a thing... a very interesting and flammable thing.
You could say, my friend.
Yes, I look work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately, I find work for men, for special education.
I don't know the Czech language, I'm a teacher of young children, I'm not an engineer and I don't have a driver's license.
It's also a great way to find housing.
I am abroad for the first time and just don't know what to do and how to act.
I can't find a job for a month, I just cleaned in one house.
I understand that the situation in Prague is very difficult, so I don't even go there
Here I have problems anywhere üò≠ I'm abroad for the first time, I don't know the languages and I'm all alone.
I and 20 other people were fired by the agency after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find a job anymore.
I ask people, look at sites - nothing
In this village I attend a course.
One lesson per week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, the situation now is such that I have to hold on to free housing while it is available.
And watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options.)
I don't want to just sit back because housing won't be free for long.
I get it
I don't want to take money from you.
I don't want opinions about lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in an ordinary city, not in the capital.
The difficult road from Ukraine for three days and a big city where a foreign language scared me very much.
I did not come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Perhaps you know someone in small towns?
I can look after the children, cook, clean, work in the garden.
I know how to sew, I have training to sew on a sewing machine.
I made bed linen and some clothes to order.
Maybe there will be such a job.
I'm able to do that!
Hugs and congratulations to everyone!! üôè üèª ü§ó ü§ó ü§ó üíê üåû

More than 100 missiles flew into Ukraine today üò°

All thoughts were with the child.

Everything will be Ukraine!
Let's get this shit out!

Sometimes it covers, of course)))
Then I clean, cook, communicate)))

I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! üôè üèª üíê ü§ó
Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the issue of withdrawing or not withdrawing the association of Russian psychologists from European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is the main thing.
I will give an analogy.
If one child takes a toy from another child in the sandbox, then most likely the adults who look after the children will try to reconcile the children and after a while the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox begins to hit another in the face with a shovel, then such a child will be isolated for a long time, and no one will play with him.
I also liked the analogy of one Russian psychologist colleague about the fact that when someone from a neighboring apartment kills someone, the whole apartment building is not put in prison.
Among Ukrainian psychologists, there are many discussions on the topic of excluding Russian associations from European ones, many feel how much pain they can't stand communicating with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to work with several psychologists from Russia that I know and share knowledge in order to treat the traumas of clients on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who, at their level, are trying to do many things to develop universal values in Russia.
Therefore, I am definitely in favor of a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that 5-10% of the population supports the war in Russia, and other figures in opinion polls are painted over by propaganda.
My wife left her native Ukraine because there is a war going on there.
The wife had a good job and no matter how bad the war was she never left her home.
In order not to sit on my wife's neck in the Czech Republic, I am trying to earn money, because once in 2009 I received a certificate of completion of masseuse courses in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money as they can.
Now there is only one problem - to learn the Czech language.
The wife teaches and works in languages and earns for herself and the child for food, for kindergarten, for a bus ticket, for mobile communication services, for clothes.
I am protecting my family at this time.
Thank you for supporting people who understand this.
Thank you to the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine at a difficult time. üá∫ üá¶ ‚ù§ Ô∏è üá® üáø‚úä
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to advertise my wife's massage services in your community.
The wife earns money on her own because she does not want to live on the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you so much
Thank you so much.
It really helps my wife earn money for her family.
OK, I'll pass it on to my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of the Ukrainian people.
Some people chuckle at my wife's announcement, but my wife offers her services.
My wife in Ukraine was a nurse, I work in the police, but the war separated us.
It's good that my wife wants to work and earn money and not wait for help from your republic.

Supervision of students in lessons, at breaks and at school events by school employees.
Safety conditions during your stay in the gym, on the playground and in professional classes
Rules of distance learning
If this is not possible due to the introduction of an emergency measure or the introduction of quarantine
Personal presence of students at school, the school provides distance education to interested students.
If the distance learning method is ordered by the school (class), students are obliged to do it this way.
The most important safety rules
In particular, it is forbidden to bring things that endanger health and safety to school and school events
Weapons (including knives), drugs (narcotics), cigarettes and alcohol.
It is forbidden to smoke and use alcohol or other drugs at school and at school events.
I really need a person who could act as an interpreter in a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we are dealing with the insurance company to fix the car.
The insurance company invited a person who can translate from Czech to Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa during the technical inspection of the car.
Can you help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific work based on a statistical analysis of the body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a separate population.
In addition, I also have experience in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in research at the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped monitor bat populations in the Kharkiv region, as well as organize wintering for bats that were disturbed by people in the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned how to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation, which is important to me.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to get acquainted with scientific works on tardigrades, observe their vital activity under a microscope and communicate with scientists who study them.
So the option of a deeper study of these and other microscopic organisms also interests me.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees - analysis from an expert
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.
It provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
Approximately 500 thousand arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors - Poland and the Czech Republic - and will tirelessly thank you!
How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden, the ProUkrainu editorial board asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has offices not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland is helping Ukrainians
The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians, and this significantly affected the livelihoods of Czechs.
In labor governments, long queues, significant price increases in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where millions of Ukrainian refugees are?
The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.
This has been foreseen.
In Poland, they have been saying for the past months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, they were less prepared for what was going to happen, while in Poland they were actively preparing.
For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the start of the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.
In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.
I heard that they were smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very balanced: To prepare for all these events even before the start of the war.
I note that extremely large funds were allocated from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing from bombing, from the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance in logistics - movement through the territory of Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical ones, for the wounded and sick.
These are planes that move between cities on the territory of Poland, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I had experience of cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as someone may think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, the payment for travel for Ukrainians was canceled.
They can travel for free on trains and public transport.
In addition, Poland has agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to get to the places where they plan to stay for free.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local self-government bodies.
For the most part, these are closed school small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
Free meals, free medical first aid are organized there.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
The large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, and Wroclaw became very active, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been created.
The example of Warsaw is generally unique in the sense that they managed to take away objects from the Russian Embassy that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes stood in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone in there.
The Polish local authorities have nationalized it, let's say.
Taken away for the benefit of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
There will be water, electricity, they are insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm adopted and the Senate approved the law on refugees from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to stay legally in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medical assistance to Ukrainians.
You just need to write an SMS, get the code on the phone.
And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, you can get medicine for free in Poland.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.
Various funds are distributed, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which give packages with food, chemicals, and clothes.
As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala."
That is, "an event that has no analogues."
Such a huge openness.
For the Polish state, this is a huge expense.
To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely large blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
The language problem as well.
The questions begin with polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems, diseases.
The second problem is schools, where students, especially in the upper grades, also do not understand themselves at all at the beginning, they cannot understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children have the knowledge not only to speak English well, but in general their level is higher than the class they enter.
This is interesting, too.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine, it is much more difficult to master this job here.
A lawyer or an accountant, I do not know such cases at all.
Doctors are now appearing in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small polyclinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.
The language problem is often the reason that prompts families to return home after a few weeks of staying here.
There are a lot of such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military operations.
They did not settle down here, did not find work.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, it will be more convenient for them to return home.
This is also one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed
According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, significant changes have occurred.
If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do the Poles feel about the millions of Ukrainian refugees?
There is a similar situation in Poland.
Here, all television channels often quote the statement of the President of Poland, Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When the events of Russia's attack on Georgia took place, together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.
There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will certainly not stop at Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.
Then there may be the Baltic countries, it may reach Poland.
That is, if he had foreseen it.
In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Poles appreciate this properly, that's why they open their homes, help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.
The threat is seen in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.
Therefore, the attitude has changed to positive.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem are now not a "song of nationalists" or some enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are still small groups among the population who have not changed their views, they exist in every country.
But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.
The claim about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who must be eliminated.
This is simply laughed at in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they have no political overtones.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those sections of society that still doubted some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are the heroes.
When Poles begin to think that there may be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives in the way that is happening now in Ukraine.
People from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities are constantly talked about here.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.
Russia fears that it will strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How does the Polish government and society react?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
In fact, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
Currently, additional recruitment to the Territorial Defense Forces is taking place in Poland.
That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
It is tangible for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.
Among this is the recently adopted new law on the defense of the homeland, where the budget has been significantly increased for Poland's military needs.
The requirements for the recruitment of the military have been changed, many points that are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert on future analytics.
Your predictions became a reality in Syria, you warned about Russia's attack.
What do you say about the analysis of the situation: When will Ukraine win and will the world manage to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for a nuclear strike, I don't believe much.
But there is such a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and for Poland as well.
It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.
I note, I wouldn't want that, but that's the worst-case scenario.
A blow of small power, but so that all television channels show this "fungus."
To be seen from Poland, the Baltic countries.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and a loss of combat capability of NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, the problems of Putin's entourage, oligarchs who are currently suffering from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.
We have the facts of the hydroelectric power plant catching fire on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are beginning to resent the prices.
Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.
We also have a tendency towards peaceful settlement of the war.
Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.
At the most, it will be delayed until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing the possible termination of gas supplies.
This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Since I am an analyst, I predicted this.
I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.
My family will not suffer the loss of this resource.
But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the increase in prices.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but the prices for all resources will definitely start to rise.
Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.
In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.
Regarding oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.
Currently, gas stations in Poland will be bought out, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe refused Russian energy carriers, it would be the loss of a source of financing for the Russian Federation's army.
Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in the Polish media
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Polish media.
What do the Polish media say about this?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has grown very much.
And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in the zone of military operations.
That is, the actions of the president are evaluated by politicians, analysts, and representatives of the authorities as very active.
They testify that the Ukrainian authorities are aiming as much as possible to receive military and financial assistance in order to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity, which sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.
You don't hear that here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, and the ability to fight the enemy has grown significantly.
It does not fade or fall.
This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.
In fact, the image of Ukraine is holding up, and this is very important.
Good morning to you.
Sorry to bother you with my problems again.
I am very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
Yesterday they tried to come up with something, but the attempt was in vain.
The mother-in-law's friend, who helped find this apartment, also joined the conflict.
She said that she was not looking for her for us, and if something doesn't suit us, we should leave and she will make sure that it is the mother-in-law, not us, who stays here to live.
Unfortunately, none of them thinks about the child, who is used to this place, considers it his home, and in 3 months of change there are already 6 homes.
I am very sorry, I could not have guessed that such a situation would happen
Once again, I'm sorry to bother you.
The bed looks strange.
We discussed this issue with my husband before I wrote to you that a bed is not needed.
He came here to see me and the baby and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law decided for herself that he would sleep with her in the room and she wanted to spit on his opinion and desires.
I am very ashamed in front of you, your husband, Sharka and Jan, the owner of the apartment.
You tried so hard for us
Got the point across.
I thought she was going on for some long term.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andriy's treatment, to do this at least until the end of the summer?
Maybe you need a certificate for Andrei that he is sick.
In Ukraine, with such a diagnosis, disability would be prescribed.
And just as Inna does not go to kindergarten yet, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the home
I understand, then it would be good to go with you tomorrow.
I will make a barcode for myself and Andrei
I am worried that they will stop providing humanitarian aid for him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a long time.
Can you give me some advice?
I also wanted to ask if you received money for the medicines you bought for Andrii?
The handle mount falls out.
It is short, so you need to be very careful not to lose it.
Only 2 portions were sold today.
The apricot is over.
Poured over the mango.
Mango doesn't go much.
Wanted most of the apricots.
Now they take more vanilla, because they don't like mangoes.
Norm, gone is the mango.
But it started creaking again üò≠
They actively started taking ice cream and he can't cope üò≠
Tomorrow there will be blackcurrants
Today will definitely run out of mangoes, and black currants
I'm all shook up üò≠
It freezes again, creaks.
Hudnes is on 4.0.
As soon as people actively take it, he does not let the ice cream in at all.
üò≠ üò≠ üò≠
It's just that the queue becomes for ice cream, it starts to give out such nuances and people move on.
It will freeze over.
If there is not one ice cream, it will creak and the piston will rub.
And vanilla in the mango can not be poured.
Magdalena can come at 8.00 tomorrow?
One has to wash the ice cream.
Today the ice cream is finished, and tomorrow another taste.

Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine
I believe that there was a dictatorship because people had just left Russia and still could not really understand whether they like being an independent country or they want to be an autonomous Republic of Russia
When Ukraine was independent, Kyiv already existed, but the city of Kharkiv was still in the Soviet Union from 1912 to 1934
I can't say that there were any other interesting events, but if there was democracy in the beginning, it would have been much better, and surely now we were in the European Union
