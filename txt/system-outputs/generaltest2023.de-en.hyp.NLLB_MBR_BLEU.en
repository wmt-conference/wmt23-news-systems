Geesthacht: New planting boards to encourage people to replant
Franko Stein (DG Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The 'Ghost in the City' initiative also includes information on what is blooming there - currently in white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blossoms" is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the town government. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, day-care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth since 2015. Goal: The Geesthacht urban area is to develop large flowering islands on which insects can find food at any time. "In favorable weather conditions, the bees fly out in January to look for food", says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has bee hives on the property.
In order to ensure that the project is not only an action of conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also reaches wide circles in the private gardens, explanatory boards are always placed for the plants. Approximately 50 signs have been placed so far. Passersby should thus be able to find out what is flourishing so nicely here.
In the first week of January, the season for wild hazel
More recent are shrubs such as winter cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been in the earth of the buckets on the Bergedorer street for a year now, now have the first delicate white and pink blossoms and have recently been thought with additional signs. "The winter cherry is a very broad bush and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide", is to be read there among further details, such as the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bed plants are now showing flowers, in the first week of January the season for the Wildhazel has already begun. it blooms especially abundantly on the dirt road at the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holertstraße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "The steppe keeps me young"
Munich - Dance God Fred Astaire would be proud of you when he looks down from the sky at Munich East station!
Every Monday at 3:00 p.m. there, at the Mandolin Motion Show Academy, three ladies meet for a rapturous tap dance - together they're an incredible 277 years old, pardoned young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap dancing are my life, I can't imagine living without".
Ernestine is joined by Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79).
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would say a musical actress, she worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I've spent my life dancing, acting and singing".
Elfriede Widmann, 79 years old, is like the chick in the tap-dancing ring and says, "We are simply having fun here with our dance teacher, Sissy Engl".
The tap dance was developed in the United States in the 19th century and is now known worldwide. With two metal plates, each more durable than the original wooden soles used, attached to the front and back of the shoe, rhythmic sounds are created during the dance, which match the visual impression and the music.
Sissi Engl, 77 years old, is the soul of the dance studio at the Ostbahnhof station. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a large family, with us big and small, old and young are welcome".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Sports keep me young", the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, eat well and don't drink alcohol".
Analogue in dialogue - The limits of the digital
With the digital transformation, many people are returning to analogue technology
The speed with which our daily lives have become digital has left us with little time to establish rules for dealing with it and adapt our communication and working practices, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, you had three options: you could either be one of the six percent of lucky people who had a private connection, or you could be one of the lucky ones who had someone from that exclusive group living nearby and calling their relatives for a bottle of Cyclabberger, or you could find a telephone exchange -- not to forget the smell of the plastic earpiece or the clicking of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to call and see the other person's face -- video telephony.
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old economist now has 14 days to do so.
Only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had resigned, the pro-EU leader of government was under enormous pressure, as she herself had explained by her resignation - apparently from pro-Russian forces opposed to her.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighbour of Ukraine that is suffering economically from the war, with inflation at over 40 percent, and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the legislature of Chisinau, the pro-European PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority of 63 out of 101 seats, so no problem in confirming the new head of the government and his cabinet.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians have become more popular with the support of the Kremlin.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
2023 is the year of celebrations in Veitshöchheim, the fifth season is in full swing and celebrity was not long in coming.
Father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
The Bavarian Minister of the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franken came Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich with his wife Anja.
The Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is taking it into space!
State Parliament speaker, Ilse Aigner, chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace and love mode, Bavarian Health Minister Klaus Holetschek with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, also known as Minister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy, Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne, wearing silver.
He even plays the sheriff in Fasching: Bavarian Minister of the Interior, Joachim Herrmann, with his wife Gerswid at his side.
On the waltz: economy minister Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to craftsmanship with his costume and his partner, Tanja Schweiger, county councillor in the district of Regensburg, does the same.
The political opposition was not to be missed.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The walking is the passion of the SPD group leader Florian von Brunn with the SPD state chairman, Ronja Endres.
Royal went on to become FDP leader Martin Hagen, who and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
He will certainly say more in the future, for in Veitshöchheim the chairman of the European Parliament Group, Mr Manfred Weber, was travelling as a pantomime, accompanied by Mrs Andrea.
Even if politics doesn't work out, he can still do magic, like Nuremberg OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
As a bee on the move: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back in the 1920s, the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, the director of the BR, Katja Wildermuth and the director of the BR culture program, Björn Wilhelm.
A small side kick against the climate activists by the Frankish crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Not to be missed were the first mayor of Veitshöchheim, Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: A bold eighth in the World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and closes with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, which is there as a TV expert, is still undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partly strong fog did not prevent permanent victor Bö from collecting his second gold on the race track.
There's little doubt that he will be in the hunt number three next. In the chase, Bo is once again the clear favorite, and his running form is outstanding, allowing him to compensate for misfire with a degree of frightening ease.
After the routine with a penalty round in the mixed relay had given all the chances of a medal for the opening round and it had only given place six, it did not run better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in lying down and two more standing were a great disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success in his career in this discipline in 2017.
In High Pile he surprisingly won six years ago with a 0.7 second lead over Bo. It was one of only three career successes Dolls has ever had on the podium this winter. The Beijing Olympic eight moved after his weak performance without words and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to the 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel ranked 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "We have to stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will focus on the value of democracy, with both looking back at their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden has pressed for preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test", Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to fight for democracy, for the democratic values that are the core of our strength". Lula retorted, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolating itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed in a by-election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by severe rioting. Bolsonaro's supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is eerily reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol two years ago, during which supporters of then-president Donald Trump violently invaded the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening", Lula said. "Sounds familiar to me", replied Biden - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note to the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF posters that showed the members of the Red Army faction being released for trial and firing?
In a country with a culture of denunciation that existed before Corona, the public sentiment was made against the most dangerous opponents of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society.
Now the Stuttgart newspaper, which is usually after redheads in the subway or onanists in the park, is putting out a new edition with the friends of the "war criminal" Putin. Since they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed because there are in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, but from No. 1 to No. 5 (!) is Mrs. Wagenknecht, followed by Mrs. Schwarzer.
Now, I don't know anybody around me who reads this paper anymore, and if they do, it's high time it was, because we've reached the familiar level where there's nothing below it.
At the latest by now, in all fairness, Mrs Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all those who are not yet completely stupid, that is to say the peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And there is no need for any distinction any more)
Harald Glööckler filed for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Design designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer, Christian-Oliver Moser, to Bild newspaper and RTL in the same terms, who said: "I can confirm that my client has submitted an application to the competent court through his family lawyer for the dissolution of his partnership. I do not comment on the details".
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, rumors of separation have been around for about a year.After his participation in jungle camp, the fashion designer is already said to have moved from the common house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports.
The SS massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane: the last survivor is dead
A memorial centre was established in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were not destroyed. French President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. He said Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France. He also contributed to Franco-German peace.
A curve for 14 houses: in Homeias, everyone knows everyone
The LZ-series Nordlippiske Weiler: In Homeien, three or four generations often live under one roof. Here the residents find pure idyll. In the summer, 300 motorcycles per day roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even immediately return.
Deutsche Bank chief Christian Sewing believes that more interest rate hikes are "absolutely" necessary in the fight against high inflation. "Inflationary risks remain high". "Energy costs can easily rise again, and the opening up of China could also temporarily boost prices", Sewing told Welt am Sonntag.
In the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive time and envisaged a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for its meeting on 16 March.
High interest rates can make credit more expensive, which may reduce demand and thus counteract high inflation rates, and at the same time, high interest rates can delay investment and thus weaken economic growth.
"The consequences of sustained high inflation are far more severe than the higher cost of financing for some countries", said Sewing. "Of course we have to be aware of this, but a high level of debt must not deter the ECB from taking firm action".
As regards the euro area, the ECB is targeting price stability at 2% inflation over the medium term.This target has been far from reaching for several months.Even though the upturn in price inflation eased again in January, consumer prices in the euro area of the 20 countries now involved were still 8.5% higher than in the previous month.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can then afford less for one euro.Strong energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, also burden businesses.
If inflation remains high, private consumption "will collapse sooner or later", warned Sewing, who is also chairman of the Bundesverband Deutscher Banken (BdB). "That is what I currently see as the biggest risk to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario".
Bosch chief Stefan Hartung hopes that there will be a broad debate on the "German pace" for infrastructure projects, as promoted by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue. And it will be a bit more controversial", he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will emerge that does not have to go as fast as the LNG terminals that came into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened after ten months of planning and construction. The goal was to close the gap in gas supply due to lack of Russian gas supplies. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had talked about a new "Germany-Tempo" on the occasion.
"First, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters, but this should not automatically mean that from now on we should always act so categorically and put a windmill in our neighbour's garden against his will", said Hartung.
In the past, they tried and failed to do it with the traditional set of rules. "We should think again whether the previous approach was correct. Maybe we exaggerated with the set of rules and made it too complicated".
He added that, given the many open tasks, such as the extension of the power lines, he was not jealous of the Federal Government and the companies involved: 'As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need this extension and it must be as green as possible.'
Union warns of destruction of the Bayer Group
"From the point of view of the employees, Bayer, with its three mains, is in just the right position for the challenges of the future", said Francesco Grioli, member of the union's executive board and of Bayer's supervisory board, to the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
These include the pharmaceutical prescription business, the consumer health nonprescription drug business and agriculture business. "The transformation of industry is only tackled with a business approach based on risk management and sustainability - not hedge fund activism".
In the background is the change of head of the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday: the controversial head Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The former head of pharmaceuticals of the Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is set to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time. The acquisition of the US seed producer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars, completed in 2018, depends on the manager. With the purchase, the people of Leverkusen had brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the weedkiller glyphosate into the house.
It was known for some time that Baumann had not intended to extend his contract, which was originally to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors were pressuring. More recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital have joined forces.
The very small fund with an unknown amount of stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off of the "Consumer Health business would be a possible way to increase the value of the company", Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the Rheinische Post.
Hundreds of thousands to demonstrate against pension reform
The Paris
The French want to take to the streets again on Saturday to protest against the planned pension reform.
As the government plans to go ahead, unions are protesting in the streets, with hundreds of thousands of people planning to demonstrate against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate nationwide against the planned pension reform of President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the plans of the Centre government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Over one million people have already taken to the streets twice and nationwide strikes have taken place. Last Tuesday 750,000 people participated in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in parliament for a week now.
Already many people in France are working longer than they need to until the age of 62 if they have not paid enough into a deduction free pension when they reach the age limit. Opponents of the reform believe that in many strenuous occupations people could hardly work longer.
Macron: Threat of a deficit in the pension fund
Macron reasons the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees with their contributions would have to pay for a growing number of pensioners. In order to keep the level of pension stable, the population should work a little more. Critics question the calculations of the government and demand that the state should find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
As well as lowering the retirement age, the government wants to speed up the increase in the required initial contribution period for a full pension, which it decided to increase years ago, to abolish individual pension systems with benefits for certain occupational groups and to raise the minimum pension to around €1200.
The pension reform is considered one of the most important projects of President Macron. A first attempt to implement the reform was canceled during the coronavirus pandemic, which led to massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron attempted to reform the French pension system, with varying success, and widely-spread protests and strikes were all expected.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in Parliament, it hopes to carry through the reform with the help of the conservative Republicans, who have announced their support, but some MPs, even those from Macron's faction, still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a narrow vote is now Macron's concern about crippling strikes. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility that they would proceed calmly and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather is expected with plenty of sunshine in the high seas
A powerful area of high pressure over Central Europe controls the weather in Germany. Does that mean lots of sunshine is to be expected everywhere?
Other
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected for at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately comes into view directly over Central Europe", explains meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "While this high temperature will shift a little to the east over the next week, it will continue to determine the weather in Germany".
But even calm high-pressure weather in the winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "It can be quite brutal and leave people in the lowlands with a dreary cloud for days, while in the high country it is sunny in the high mountain range".
From the Ardennes Mountains and the Thuringian forest to Lower Bavaria, it may rain according to the DWD. Especially at the Alpine edge, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens over the course of the day and the sun appears more and more often. In the rest of the country, it remains highly cloudy or highly foggy. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, in the vicinity of the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the sun, which gradually becomes more intense, again bites at the high fog, and may melt away more and more during the day", says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high ranges of the Mittelgebirge and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia sunshine is expected all day, and elsewhere it must first fight its way through the high fog. The highs will range between 5 and 9 degrees; the lows in the Lower Rhine will be around 11 degrees; the permanent greys in the southeast, on the other hand, are expected to reach only 3 degrees. In addition, weaker winds are blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands again there can only be a tough resolution of fog or haze. Otherwise, the weather will be clear after fog resolution. In high places, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, the sun shines according to the forecasts all day long. The temperatures rise to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
No more World Cup medal for Goggia
The top favourite, Sofia Goggia, was deeply disappointed after her exit in the downhill stages of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
French
"I am sad, because I did not provide the performance that I can", said the Italian woman in the ZDF after she had been roped in a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old could barely prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant rider in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six seasons in this discipline. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving, must wait for a world medal in her discipline.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was all about the hundredth of a second", Goggia said now after the surprise victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel. "I'm disappointed. I gave it everything. But this is life". Sometimes you think that things are guaranteed, she said about the medallion expected by all experts and finally missed, "They are not".

Selensky and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
With the call for exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have stepped up pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
During a joint telephone conference they agreed to write a declaration to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Sports Ministry announced on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues", said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The videoconference, held at the initiative of the United Kingdom, was a productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made Britain's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus cannot be represented at the Olympic Games, and we will now issue a joint statement on this topic".
Earlier, at an international video conference of sports ministers and other top officials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskiy protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions", Selenskiy said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel.
Ukraine threatens with boycott
Ukraine also considers Belarus a war party because the country is providing Russian troops military bases for attacks.Selensky called on officials to protect Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from competing.The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its integrity".
The conference was prompted by the announcement of the IOC to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions; Ukraine also threatened to boycott if the IOC allowed them to compete.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
Afterwards, the Federal Interior Ministry responsible for sports stated that it had also reaffirmed during the discussions the rejection of any start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to have the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The effort of the IOC to resume the Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way", said a spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior.
The Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser (SPD) stressed at the end of January that "sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population.
Russia and Belarus are currently banned from many international competitions, but the IOC wants athletes from both countries to return to the international sporting arena, under a neutral flag, as long as they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine.
Stepping up where it happens
"Hey, hot ass!" whistling at the dumb lady in a tight sexy outfit and shouting obscene sentences: all of this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind that term there is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost: US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
Half of the vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The Pentagon estimates that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has already lost half of its tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to U.S. Defense Department estimates. "Presumably half of the main tank stock" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine", said Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary for international security affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide additional information regarding U.S. estimates of the number of tanks seized and destroyed at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger 2 battle tanks for March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The USA has also promised a battalion of 31 Abrams tank tanks. However, their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to catch up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin head Dmitry Medvedev promised to build and modernise thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for planes, missiles, tanks", said Medvedev, now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, while visiting a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It's clear that in this case it's a matter of course for us to increase the production of various weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks".
A law came into force last summer in Russia which allows the economy to be better aligned with the needs of the army, for example by obliging certain industries to supply the armed forces.
The problem of vacancies in the army
The post to be held by the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner was not advertised, the personnel representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects of post corruption and abuse of office.
The Minister stated that it was not necessary to make a tender as the appointment would take place in a previously vacant job; she did not want to comment on "speculation by an independent staff representative". Ortner had been dismissed last year after 17 years as head of the HGM; in addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he had faced serious allegations of bullying, which, according to Tanner, had been dismissed.
Jedlaucnik also doubts the suitability of Ortner's content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current questions of security policy.
The SPÖ wants Tanner to clarify the "unusual ordering procedure". Robert Laimer, a SPÖ spokesman, says the decision has "the air of post hacking".The Neos want Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in corruption", said Douglas Hoyos, a spokesman for national defence.
Carnival: First Fools to Kneel at the Cost
In contrast to the state capital, the Thuringian carnival town of Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional facing move, even though higher costs, including for security, are difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. e funds alone accounted for about half of the total estimated cost of the move.
In Brandenburg, no Carnival Parades are cancelled. The "Joyeous People's Parade" in Cottbus, arguably again the largest in East Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. Even the Swabian-Alemanic Fast Night has not been cancelled.
Even at the current high cost, the carnival society in Schleswig-Holstein is sticking to the traditional procession. "We are going through with our event", says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. However, financial problems continue to be pressing: if more sponsors were not found or the previous ones were paying more, reserves would have to be tapped - "this is not possible every year". The current deficit is approximately EUR 200,000.
And the inflation: in the sweet, there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Nürnberg Fastnachtzug promotion association. Thanks to luck in the misfortune, 2020 was over-ordered, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that the move will become more expensive. For security, twice as many staff will be needed as in 2020.
Those on the outskirts of the way on the Rosenmontag train in the Rhineland might get fewer camels than previously. Because sweets have become more expensive, some participants will not have much. Camels to go, there might be a large demand of visitors: "I think that if it is not raining buckets on that day, we can certainly expect an increased demand", says train conductor Holger Kirsch from Cologne. "This is due to the fact that there has not been a regular Rosenmontag train for two years. Of course, there is nothing to replace the train".
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on the costs, but generally speaking the train is "deficient", it is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Self-Burned Vodka
The Ukrainians are not considered safe to drink for nothing. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lemberg. Every once in a while, I discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries, like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can not tell much difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widespread. They burn it here especially in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. Exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics, nobody knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health a few years ago claimed that consumption has dropped by an impressive 80 percent in five years. Well, you can hardly believe the Russians here. As a tourist, you should be cautious about it. But then, only if it is sold in the masses will this also go well.

If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or a beer at the end, there are great places in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the spotlight for club parties. Where is it the best? A look at the Google ratings will tell you.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favourite win and praises the High Court
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweeper Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal distribution of the Oberhof World Cup sprint, but there were two glimmers of light in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to see from the tribune of honor on Saturday whether the windows on the shooting range had actually fallen. "I had to get the results on my phone", Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted smilingly and referred to the foggy haze that kept pulling back into the stadium, which greatly affected the view on the grandstand for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10km sprint race at the Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof, got numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by Biathlon", he said, and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions.
Despite a penalty round after a shooting error, he secured in 23:21.7 minutes the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round / 39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals one day after the triumph of Denise Herrmann-Wick. Johannes Kühn placed eighth after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and became twelfth (1:14.6). Two glimpses of light behind the gray veil.
He entered the race with the number one spot in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the complicated visual conditions. However, in his last two standing shots, he had the luck of the best; they each landed on the edge of the windows and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the victory together with his brother five years older: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him", said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
"If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as a ten. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one", sports director Felix Bitterling called his "Lokomotive" to task. The organizers expect for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 / ZDF and live Eurosport) a nearly sold out arena.
Brych dislikes "Swarm of bees" in the square
Felix Brych - The referee Felix Brych decides on the referee's ball.
German referees want to "punish in a consistent manner" unsportsmanlike conduct. Head referee Fröhlich points to a role model.
The German referee Felix Brych has noticed negative trends among each other on the court. "I already think that there are new behaviours of the players who after decisions surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area", the 47-year-old told the German press Agency. "We discussed this in the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it".
The two coaches with recent expulsions had also been considered. The Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, it was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "The conduct of the coach also falls in the area of unsportsmanship. We have noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards the referees has become a bit demanding or aggressive. Such unsportsmanship we want to consistently address", said Brych.
DFB-arbitral-chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good coexistence of coaches and non-partisans. "On the whole, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The affected party then has to live with this. It should not be anything world-moving", said Fröhlich of the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can cause conflict in the course of the game. But if emotionality turns into a personal insult, then you also have to accept that the corresponding measures are taken by the referee", said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have cleared things up afterward. "It would only be important if a process of rethinking was also triggered overall, that such behaviour is simply not appropriate", said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Federation of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects at a different level. "Of course events from professional football are always coloured. There is a role model effect, which leads to imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviours", said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful".
The combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach.
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal course and the ten-kilometer ski-jumping race by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combiners will not compete in the Black Forest in the best team. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing for the World Championships in Oberstdorf, which will take place from 21 February to 5 March in the Slovenian Planica. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team feels it of course", said German coach Hermann Weinbuch in ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after road accident on the A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident with four vehicles on Highway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar Circle), including two children. According to a police notice, the accident occurred on Saturday, when a car driver crashed against a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed him onto two other cars. The complete closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
The initiators of the exhibition, Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) are standing with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition at the Marler Sculpture Museum ends with a few extras.
The closing speech to the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, 12 February, at 3 p.m. in the Transition Quarter of the Marler Sculpture Museum in the Georg-Herwegh-Strasse 63-67.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over, the artworks disappear, but a catalogue documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It is presented on 12 February by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
As a conclusion, Dr Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the Community. Using numerous graphic examples, she will present the peculiarities of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the lines of connection to this art genre in the Federal Republic with an emphasis on NRW in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and graduated 2013 to the mural paintings of the Weimar Republic. Since then she has been researching on building-based art as well as art and institution history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art on the construction in NRW. After the lecture, the last curators' tour of the exhibition takes place.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about tree defects which led to the collapse of buildings: in the earthquake region of Turkey, the judicial authorities issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul: In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for suspected structural defects in buildings that collapsed during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, 33 people were arrested, state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The defendants are accused of structural defects that contributed to the collapse of buildings.
The prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating for possible building defects in collapsed buildings, and the investigation has so far issued 62 arrest warrants. One of the accused was reportedly caught at Istanbul airport trying to travel to Montenegro with cash, and is in pretrial detention. The nine others were arrested in the towns of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
A 7.7 magnitude quake shook the Turkish-Syrian border area early Monday morning, followed by another 7.6 at noon, collapsing more than 7,500 buildings in Turkey alone.
Last Prime Minister of the GDR, Hans Modrow has died.
Hans Modrow has died, as the left-wing group in the German parliament has announced. The 95-year-old died in the night of Saturday. Dietmar Bartsch, chairman of the group, praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95", the left wing of the Bundestag announced Saturday, and the party "will therefore lose an important figure", according to the party chairman Dietmar Bartsch and its former leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district executive of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the wall, on 13 November 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days.
Left Party leader Dietmar Bartsch, in a message on the news-short service Twitter, described Modrow as a "deeply sincere and militant socialist".
"In his old age he was an important adviser in our party, "whose wisdom will be lacking".
"The entire peaceful course of German unity was a special achievement of his. This will remain his political legacy", wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary.
"His later activities in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of also representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated".
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994, and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (DPA), Modrow had viewed the new state "quite critically". According to DPA, Modrow had criticized in many interviews that the German unity had been completed too quickly, the GDR had fallen too unconditionally, and it had been condemned as a "state of injustice".
What happened that night
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky has condemned Russian missile strikes, but Kiev is forced to repair the country's power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is forcing the energy grid of Ukraine to repair again, but Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydropower plants have been damaged, the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television Friday evening. Electricity supply is especially bad in the Kharkov region. Due to instability in Ukraine's electricity grid, a reactor block at the Chmelnyzkyj CHP had to be cut, while production was curtailed at Riwne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Selenskyj condemned the Russian attack on Friday with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terrorism, but in a video message told his countrymen how much support Ukraine has received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selensky doesn 't want to abandon the small town of Bachmut.
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Ukraine's key supporter, Poland, shortly before the anniversary. However, the threat of Russian missile attacks continued on the night of Saturday. In the capital Kiev, an air alert was triggered late Friday evening for the fifth time for this day. "There is a threat of attack by drones", the military administration of the Kiev region informed. Iranian-made combat drones were also observed and shot down over the areas of Mykolajiv and Odessa in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects network company consultant
Demands from the election campaign, made by the FDP and the Greens among others, to separate them failed in the coalition partner SPD. The coalition agreement had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which should be oriented in the future to the public good, that is, it does not need to generate and deliver profits.
Restructuring budget of EUR 80 billion
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government to follow-up with this process. The congestion on the railway network is an important reason why the railway is currently very punctual. Transport Minister Wissing has set out to eliminate this problem by completing the complete renovation of railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations, it is more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon world championships in Oberhof 2023 - gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
However, the external circumstances had obviously not spoken for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", the pulse did not drop as soon as she entered the race. "Such a race", and that at the World Cup, "you can not describe with words", she said. 11,000 spectators shouted to the thundering hit music with the flags of Germany, supervisors and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoying biathlon", she had planned
The pressure was especially high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old was the biggest, if not the only German medal hope outside the relay started in the World Championship. Herrmann-Wick has been the only German to win two world cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she currently occupies fifth place. And although the performance density among the women in the top is much higher than among the men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, there were others on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Nicaraguan bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison
The Bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state, accusing Ortega of suppressing religious freedom.Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018 as demonstrators calling for Ortegas' resignation sought refuge in churches.More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018.Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of reprisals or arrest.
Bundeswehr: Defence industry calls for more orders from special funds
The first armaments projects have already been cancelled and further projects face the same threat as reported by Welt am Sonntag. "There is no need, even for the moment, to allocate specific procurement measures to any need for saving", says a response by the Federal Government to a request by Bundestag Member Ingo Gäensdech (CDU).
The background to the decreasing investment amount is the rising interest rates. The entirely loaned special funds, which the Bundestag had decided in June 2022, must bear the interest burden for the loans themselves. If these increase, less money is available for the concrete acquisitions for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation the purchasing power of the remaining amount decreases.
Copper cell: accident with 3 injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive left on the Kupferzell motorway in the direction of Heilbronn on the motorway. At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver rode the B 19 toward Künzelsau, as the police reported.
Both persons involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the accident scene indicated "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system did not result in any complaint. Further investigations followed. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The two cars suffered damage totaling approximately 20,000 euros.
Stuttgart Castle Square commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart people responded to the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria and there is great grief - including in Stuttgart.
More than 200 people gathered in Stuttgart Castle Square on Friday night to remember and pray for the victims of the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria.
Many community members followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque congregation, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's entreaty seriously and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from pests and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for the help and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands with the people of Turkey and Syria, the speakers expressed their condolences for the victims and relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event, and the appeals were also translated into German in the castle plaza.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is high. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Federation Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
For several days, the Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in the street "Bellockenstraße" to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas.
A walk with a meat pack - Ebersberg
"After the meal you must rest or take a thousand steps ".... The elderly know the saying, the young simply put it into practice. However, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because thanks to Home Office, those who sit not in the middle of a stone desert, but just a stone's throw away from the field, forest and meadow now use the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or to go out into the fresh air. At least this impression could be obtained around the Egglburger See, where between noon and 2 pm not only dogs are wandering around.
But one of the reasons could also be that the modern man, in an optimal time slot, can combine the health-enhancing supply of fresh air with other things. Why not take a short walk in nature and hear news from the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor? Or meet the friend with whom you never go to the cinema in the evening, not even in the old cinema? In this way, work and personal life could also be connected - because, who says that the meeting with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor can not take place outdoors? Unless, of course, there are no outsiders in the vicinity.
One good thing that can be done is to buy fresh products, such as fresh fruit next to cheese on a table by the side of the road, or potatoes and meat. It is stupid if you do not think about the purchase in advance and make adequate preparations. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg, for instance, leaves the wooden shop room of the farmer empty-handed and with regrets in their voices. "Wretched, we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, since you have a wallet-bearing companion but no carrying container - as you let that nice casual acquaintance know - to which the man replies: "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" Pointing to the hood of the jacket, which one quickly puts over one's hair before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an extra headcloth superfluous. "My wife always packs everything there!"
And so it happens that you make the return journey with meat on top and that on this midday excursion, you will be enriched not only by a back-but also by a very practical idea, that the second walk is due that day - after dinner, this time actually to digest.
Trapped and badly injured
About 21.00 the 25-year-old drove in his Audi on the ring road towards Hailfingen and came off of the road in a left turn to the right for an unexplained cause, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guide post, laterally bumped against a tree and stopped some meters away. The collision trapped the driver in his car. The firefighters released him with a heavy device. The rescue service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since the suspicion of drunk driving was, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report the Audi caused a fatality damage in the amount of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax returns: A point for the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has ruled that the Treasury Department must turn over the former president's tax returns to Congress.
Trump 2018, when he was the President of the United States.
The Treasury Department must instruct the Internal Revenue Service to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the department said in its Friday ruling.
Contrary to political conventions in the US, Trump did not disclose his tax returns as a candidate or later as president. He fought for a disclosure, fighting it all the way to the Supreme Court. The New York District Attorney's office now has the documents, but no details can be made public - unless there was a trial.
The issue of Congress is more sensitive for Trump: there, the circle of those entitled to access the data is somewhat larger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the ruling as a "victory for the rule of law", tweeting that access to the Republican tax records was a matter of national security. "The American people deserve to know the facts on his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president", Pelosi said.

British criminal caught in Thailand after long escape
London - A convicted British drug trafficker has been captured in Thailand after five years on the run, the NCA said on Saturday, after being arrested on Friday by Thai police in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "Most Wanted" list of most wanted criminals.
The leader of a criminal group, according to authorities, had fled early 2018 at the beginning of a trial in which he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (€9 million).

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the educated physicist from Lower Saxony who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits this. Whether this fits well in the general prevailing domestic science scepticism is unknown. In any case, his humor fits very well into Vienna.
The English language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, after all, he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. Now he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about his experiences overseas, but also explains what knowledge is and what it can do and what not. There is, of course, Corona, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off -- what is really important? -- and does it with a big wink, and very calm, and very ironic, so that we're not just having fun, we're also learning in the process.

1. general
The single man entertainment device Battlezone is equipped with a vector or X / Y monitor. This game depicts the combat from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are carried out in a vast valley, completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley plains there are rock pyramids and rock squares, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shells.
The player is presented with slow moving chain vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles that are increasingly difficult to hit, as the game progresses. In addition, UFOs still appear periodically. These can not attack the player's tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score through a UFO hit. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game-conducting sequence, the game sequence, the initial input for high scores, and the self-test sequence.
4. Course of play
The gameplay is triggered when the START button is pressed, the LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds are heard. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game ends. The game begins with slow moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The position of each enemy tank or missile can be determined by the player by observing the text displayed in the upper-left display corner of his cockpit.
The top cone on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to target on the screen. Furthermore, FIGHTING OUT MISSION is also shown in the upper left display.
UFO's are designed to round off the combat and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's armor as well as the enemy's armor. A shot through the armor earns the player 5,000 points in this mode. If an opponent is hit, the following long points are reached: 1,000 points for a falling armor, 2,000 points for a missile and 3,000 points for a Super-Armour.
5. Initial input at highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum points in the highest score table, they can enter three (3) personal initials into the table at the end of the game. The instruction is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that by triggering a self-test, disabling the RESET button on the Battlezone Analogue Vector Generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply, the table with the highest score is deleted. When deleting (RESET), the ten (10) highest point numbers, along with their initials, are retained and re-entered on the screen to challenge other players.
New parts
If you have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should note the important differences in these components. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI switch lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing, which has made this assembly more stable and ensures a proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another change is the Zentrale rubber buckle, which, like a centralized spring, always returns the control lever to the central position. The microscopes are now more comfortable, making it easier to rotate with a self-healing motherboard. A new image stabilizer has been built, with the help of a new VINC-based design, to provide a higher resolution for the screen, the screen, and the networking of several consoles at the same time. This has been made possible by a larger screen, and an upgraded version of the console, with two VINC-based C series of console to support a higher resolution.
These new parts, as well as all the other major components of this appliance are shown in figure 1.
When removed from the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready for use, however, to complete the quality control, you should carry out a certain check. To have certainty that the device has been delivered to you in correct condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: The device is not yet connected to the 220 V network. A. Inspect the outside of the case for damage.
NOTE: Do not force plug connections. The connectors are fitted with a force guide, so that a correct connection is made. A 180 degree twist of the connector will destroy the PCB.
(2) Verify the connector connections to the Game PC board are in a correct and fixed location. (3) Note the production number of the device on the model label on the back of the device. (3) Check the serial number printed corresponds with those on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, the Auxiliary PC board, the Controller / Audio II PC board and the TV monitor. A map of the position of the production number can be seen on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided exactly when you call your dealership for more service information. (4) Check all other main components, such as the grid connection, to make sure the battery is connected properly, and the TV monitor with the correct label on the rear wall of the unit.
Do you have problems with your software?The following are a number of tips that may help you solve most of the problems associated with current DirectX games.
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the packaging.You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Program to get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements.To call the DirectX Diagnostic Program please do the following: Click the Start button and choose the Run option. Enter "dxdiag" in the text box.The DirectX Diagnostic Program user interface will now appear.Here you will have access to all the relevant system details including information about graphics and sound cards.You can also check if sound graphics are working correctly by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the DirectX Diagnostic Program to enable the DirectX Diagnostic Program to test you in case we don't know your computer's start rates and changes.
Some other programs may take over the system resources required for the game to run correctly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are automatically booted at startup. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are called "Background applications". In some cases, they can cause your program to hang or crash. That is why we recommend that you stop these background applications before you start the game. - If there are any antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, search for an icon in the Windows Taskbar.
Before you install software, you need to make sure that your hard drive is working at its optimum. So you should make a habit of cleaning up your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleaning to keep everything running smoothly. Chances are then high that your current games on your PC run largely without problems. A clean system also has the advantage of being much more efficient and, consequently, running other applications you use faster and more reliably.
Click on the start button and select the Help option (or Help and Support) to access Windows Help.  Now click on the search box and type in the appropriate keyword, such as ScanDisk (Win 98/ME), Drug Tracking (Win 2000/XP), Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup. You will receive instructions on how to use these tools.
Is the game crashing or hanging?
To play games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure that you have the latest drivers for your video card. This is often a good way to prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First of all, try to download the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website.
How to stop all unnecessary background usage
Important note: After completing the game, you should reactivate the background applications by restarting your PC. This will automatically reactivate any background applications you left. Windows 98/ME
1.Keep STRG and ALT on your keyboard, then press ENTF. Now the Close application window will appear, listing all the background applications currently running on your system. 2.To quit a background application, click on the entry in the task menu and then on the Exit task button. Note: Do not quit the Explorer and Systray background applications under any circumstances, as these are needed to run Windows. All other background applications can be safely quit. 3.The window will now close and the task is finished. Repeat the above steps to quit all other background applications (up to Explorer and Systray on Windows 2000/PX Professional).
To close a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click the appropriate entry in the taskbar, and then press the "Finish the task" button. Note: Depending on your system settings, pressing STRG, ALT, and ENTF might not open the Windows Security window but the Windows Task Manager will appear in Windows XP Home.
(1) Hold down STRG and ALT keys on your keyboard and press ENTF. Now Windows Task Manager appears. (2) To stop a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click the appropriate entry in the taskbar and then click the "End Task" button before calling the hotline.
If you wish to make a call, sit down at your PC and prepare the following information (see the section 'Checking System Configuration'), including notes. - PC make and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98; Windows® Me) - RAM (memory) - Graphics and sound card and driver information
What is the role of the Commission?
The desire to develop video games was ignited in me by the advent of 3D real-time interactive technology, which suddenly opened a plethora of new possibilities in life and appeared to me a new form of expression, with which the world might be pushed to its limits. It presented for me a way to open new horizons. I felt for myself, as a pioneer of cinematography at the turn of the twentieth century, that, while I struggled with the still immature technology, on the one hand, I was aware that everything still had to be unearthed - especially a new language that had to be behind both narrative and fully visual. To be honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my creative appetite. I felt that the fact that video games had been designed with only a few interactive features would give me the hope to explore the world with its boundaries. I thought that it would make the whole experience easier and that, if we had a chance to continue to build our own experiences of racing and play in a manner which would be more creative than the other forms of interactive play, it would give me the courage to continue to raise and question this very important and uncompromising fact that both the ability to create a new game and to be able to live outdo ourselves.

This SERVICE MANUAL is intended to familiarize you with the installation and maintenance of the QIX TV entertainment machine. On the front pages, in addition to important instructions for installation and maintenance, the course of the game is described. The following service tips are required for general knowledge of microprocessors, TTL circuits and TV monitors. Without knowledge in these areas, no repair of the electronic device should be attempted.
The information and pictures contained in this SERVICE MANUAL are current at the time of printing.
Damage caused by transport
Where external transport damage is recognizable, these must be denounced at once, recorded on a transport document and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railway, etc.).
The machine is set to the mains voltage indicated on the type plate. For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. According to the VDE regulation, the machine is equipped with a protective conductor connector and intended only for dry rooms. The correct operation of the coin system requires the right setting of the machine.
IMPORTANT: If at any time there is an uncomprehensible signal on the monitor, please turn off the machine for a short while (pull out the power plug) and then turn it back on.
Remove power supply plug before repairing! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch voltage-carrying parts! Even if the equipment is off, the monitor can still produce dangerous voltage. WARNING, HIGH VOLTAGE! There are approximately 20000 volts at the anode connection of the image tube. Replace fuses only with those with the same values. A burnt fuse signals the overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced with a higher-quality one, serious damage can be caused. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never pressed circuits / connections when the equipment is switched on.
Game play
Pressing the corresponding start button starts the game for one or (at minimum 2 credits) 2 players. One has to try to get a lot of area, without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the travelling SPARX. The gameplay is set so that a minimum prescribed area must be covered before one can attack the next area (round). On the upper screen, the temporally controlled SPARX are shown by red timing lines. At intersections of the red lines will release additional SPARX. At an alarm, SPARX SUPER-SPARX will be updated and more aggressive. If you try to enclose your territory, your marking in your death sign will be reduced, you will not be able to achieve a full stop, you will not reach your destination, and you will be able to reach the control grid and destroy the control program after 4 seconds.
The QIX game is able to check itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working correctly. See "Service Program" for additional information. The volume can be set in the volume controller (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC-Board.
Programming and testing switch: SUB-TEST
Function: Switch to the next stroke
Programming and test switch: TEST
Function: Switch to the next program step (display)
Programming and testing switch:
Function: Reset to factory setting (until green), counting by step (when green) Programming and testing Switch: Down
Function: counting down by one step
In the instrument, it is possible to install a coin counter, a line to 412 V DC supply, a line to socket J 15-13 on the ROM /IC board.
The Service Program
General: For programming and testing, the four switches, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming indicator. It selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) in which the address programming and the game will work. The "Sub-Test" switch allows the setting of languages to be used. When the desired language - green - is available, the "Test" switch is pressed to switch to the next program display. Deposit programming. This indicator can be used to set the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, it can be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that can be entered before the start of the game. The next move to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-"Test switch (green), the number of points to be gained is set to this value by pressing the "Upgraded Programming" or "Sub-"test" button. Multiple "test" buttons are displayed. Once the desired language appears, press the "Test" button to jump to the next program display. The program value can be set to green. Once this value is over 99 or "Sub"-test screen is reached, it should be possible to save the maximum number of points, but not to 99,000 (example: "Upgradation programming-to-test"), and then, if the number of credits can be determined by pressing the "Maximum number of credits" button. The maximum number of points to be reached is now set to be 99.
'threshold' means the percentage to be reached to move to the next pass.
'Time limit' means the release of additional Sparx
'Difficulty' means the degree of difficulty of the game
'Pulling tone': at "0", no sound when in standstill
For "1" sound also in stand mode (animation tone) "table model": for "0" stand mode
for "1" tableware
The points and initials of the player, including the next 10 point values, are shown. These values are used to match the highscores selected on the previous display (set from "back"). Pressing the "Up" button sets up the initials of the QIX standard. Pressing the "Test" button displays the next program display. The "Total Score" button can set to 0 minutes. Pressing the "Up" switch can set the Minutes Minutes to 0 minutes. The following are recorded: total number of minutes credited: total number of credits paid out. If the total number is not reached at 0 minutes. The total number of credits won from 100 000 coins earned on the previous display (set from "back").
High Score: The number of times a player had high enough hit rates to displace other players from the high score list. Pressing the "Up" button sets the values to 0. Pressing the "Test" button displays the next program display.
Flip slot programming / standard coin setting This indicator allows the flipper to select a standard coin setting or program another setting.
In case of a default setting, the programming is selected by pressing the 'Up' and 'Down' buttons while the top digit is lit green on the screen. The size values change as the digits change. If the right setting is achieved by pressing the 'Test' button the setting is adopted. If a setting that does not correspond to the default setting is desired, the values can be set by pressing the 'Sub-Test' switch. After a single pressing the upper setting number is set to 0, meaning that custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can decrease his coin setup minima by selecting a setting that matches the value of his/her weighted coins and the value of the coins closely matching the values. The size values are changed when changing the numerical value. When the test is achieved by pressing the "Sub-Test" button the value is set at "SIMMONYCoin Upgrade" ("SM" - "SIMMONYCoinUpgrade") and the required amount can be reduced before the minimum amount is used to increase a certain number of units.
When "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM in which all programming is stored has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This state probably indicates a battery failure or error.
Error and settings
Testing method: Begin by pressing the "Subtest" button or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can start. Tests and settings can be entered for each program display, pressing the "Test" button will show the next program each time. If a duration test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the Auto Test mode. Under this program, the device will perform the hardware test continuously until it switches off. When the "Open Door to Coin Test" (money to be checked) appears, the program must be removed from the control panel. This is 1 J-19 - 1 J-2 (RAM / memory = 19 CM/s)
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each Video ROM, and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a discrepancy, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is erroneous, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be exchanged. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be entered as Banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's.
The Communications RAM test determines the reliability of memory that is shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the latch is holding on with the display, a fault has been detected. If the Communications RAM's failed during the video board test, the fault may have been caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or a fault in the data board. To locate the fault, remove data board from P6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Fault in U3, U4 or related circuits.
The video board is CMOS RAM.
After entering values into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the communications RAM. If the test is passed, all the memory slots are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the display among others, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing pre-determined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are followed for correctness when retrieving. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM).The display RAM is tested by inscribing a pattern on each side.The results of these entries are compared with the original pattern.Any discrepancy will cause the program to stop and the LEDs will show the faulty RAM.If a display RAM is failing, identify the problem and replace the RAM.If this error diagnosis shows no RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), indicates that the next test will be started (data hardware).The connection to the data processor must be available and it must be functional.
Unfortunately, disappointed.
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star # 1. The second one is that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable sewing defects. BUT I was probably expecting too much, because the disappointment was even greater. I had orientated myself according to the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Because it should be so narrow and I didn't want to fight in an S or M at my height... In the end it would have fit from the length and from the hip... the rest I could swim. Moreover, the lining came across one already when opening the package and was distributed everywhere. Just damages..:
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket looks great. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it well on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is very excited about it. She wears the 158 and you fit the 36 quite well in this case and will certainly continue to wear it next year. We can recommend an order.
High quality
I opted for the rubber c because I always work with wood on the hoist and that's not optimal. Unfortunately I measured too much and the upholstery doesn't fit completely. What is my mistake. Then I made a small change so that it fits. The upholstery seems very strong and you don't damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or the whole surface. It worked without any problems. It doesn't slip anymore. I would immediately buy it again.
Too big for under a year.
The product itself is okay, but not less than a year old. Because the area for masticating is much too large for the little mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of the size. Now at 12 months old we found him again and he can use it. He hasn't been able to bite on anything with his few teeth already. And if he was in the refrigerator, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not good enough / Unfortunately decreases
I was perhaps blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews here. I want to inform you that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro. I already have one very large (for equipment storage) and a rather small one with the most important, everyday things that are always taken. Because I just bought myself the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has now finally become too small and I need a replacement. I have bought this backpack for a really very reasonable price (barely 29 EUR), and actually was very proud of this purchase, although I have read many of the reviews in advance. When my backpack came yesterday, the following statement made me a lot thinner: the backpack is not bad for luggage with a high price, but you cannot tell the bag with a good price, that it is good for luggage! And even with the backpack in one hand, I was able to take my money back to another, which is not as much for the purchase of the products, but it is also not much better. However, the backpack does not have to be as much expensive as my own, because there are not many people who could afford to buy such products.
Unfortunately, disappointed with the third part.
So far I had liked the Electric series by E.L. Todd most, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and I was really looking forward to the third part. The part deals all the time with the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I thought it was unnecessary to dragged out the whole time. Taylor has been enthusiastic about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything and then with every fight he is a little child and gets off at?! At the same time, there were discrepancies in my intuition, because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor, ex and did not believe him when he said Taylor would stand up to him and tried to convince Taylor ex that he could not do without him and save himself. But at the beginning of the third part Volt seems to have forgotten everything and struggled against the stress and I hope that Taylor will have come out and read the last part of this series pretty much at once and also, I think, I had heard about the final part of the story.
Man destroys everything, knows nothing and does not learn anything! First of all: the film is sooo not bad at present as many write. Naturally, of course, the story is totally constructed, and conceived again and again following the same schema F. If you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same too: Man destroys everything and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn! And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us! Often in the film I just thought (and that even though I know that it is only a movie, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there often shoot tears in your eyes. The film Jurassic World has been made really well. Only it is a pity that my film has a humanity behind the stars and is not good, even though the message is always from the inside, a film that is consistently and consistently excellent, but we have made the latest film because the environment and the same, arrogant and rebellious animal. But, unfortunately, according to our last Ship of Ship, they would have been made to destroy our planet.
A silent and sensitive film.
Some here are waiting for a movie a la 8 Mile. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is first and foremost "French" - it is quiet, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and it makes you cry - if you engage in it and you don't expect anything that it doesn't want to be.
The problem
It tastes like Quench from the nineties, because of orange, but it doesn't matter either. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuing the diarrhea remains for a week. It should be noted that for the smaller pack size only 2 stars (unfortunately not seen until late) were given, for the larger full 5? This is very strange!
awful smell and poor result! I dyed my blond hair in October with an intensive dyeing in a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair dye remover. I used the product twice. The first time I immediately noticed that it stank terribly! However, there was a not too bad result, it came out about a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not obtained the desired result, I used it, as stated in the instructions, and with not satisfactory result, once more. This time it was a complete waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked worse on the first try. What was the worst of all, it was still dark after weeks of application. I washed my hair as often as I could, just didn't change the smell.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the pills for a long time now and always take one pill every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time because of work, too little exercise and also a long additional illness. So I wanted to give my immune system a jump not only by eating healthy but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This works very well. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great, as you also have to consider how long you can take the pills. Absolutely recommendable.
function not quite perfect!!! after 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following gross faults which I find very troublesome: 1) The cover has problems with time to "connect" with the mobile phone. This means that it will not charge even after the "Power On / Off" button is pressed for 3 seconds. If you remove the mobile phone from the cover and reinstall it, you will solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this will lead to a new flaw. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the phone in the case, the cover is so worn that it will detach from the case, so I almost lost it several times. Although there are not many deficiencies, I find with a battery case that it works just for its function for over 30€ since I have disposed of the product.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all this good rating came about. This is actually a washcloth which is a gift from any optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I promised myself a lot more of these towels. It is also very, very thin. Since I have used it, unfortunately, I can no longer exchange it. I'm disappointed, and I can't recommend it from my side. The price of these towels is greatly overpriced. You shouldn't give more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response.
I bought this speaker for the shower, when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a free gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the onforu works great, is waterproof (my shcon fell in the shower), it produces bass as bass, Bluetooth works great... Suction valve naturally you have to water, otherwise it will fall away... it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes... what I see as critical is the frequency response of this small speaker. That said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into higher frequencies. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loud while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the frequency are almost hurting the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just good enough. My bass speaker, of course, has not reproduced sound as well as I expected, but now I feel that the bass resonance is really annoying, but what is the difference between them is that it is not very well reproduced.
very bad
The paint was broken in a few places and if you just went through it by hand the paint just got lost in some places. We wanted to get them out free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately they were our cost. They were only going to exchange the damaged parts but like both the dresser was damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon did all that for us and sent the money back. A LOB to Amazon
Better spend a little more money.
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. The items are delivered to you, which you have to stick together by yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope, made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. The postman stuffed the product right into my letter box, so some of the templates were damaged. I did not complain, because I urgently needed this product. The supplied glue hardly lasts, but sticks properly - like chewing gum, which does not get hard. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden sticks. Since the glue material does not dry up (at least it was still not dry for 5 days after gluing), it is necessary to be very careful not to glue everything together. The templates are high in the end and I would not use a lot of money to spend on a high-end product, but would make money.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not that clear. + Magnetic closure + nice look + stable when built + shelf board can be positioned as you wish
- Doors pop by magnets (you might be able to offset with rubber cups) - some places not clean
- the doubles supplied are much too small and wobbly (I did not have any others and since there was no goblet in the house, I stuck them with homemade glue) - the brackets for the inlay floor wobble a little (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If it did not look so good and had such good measurements, I would give it fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Furthermore, I also find it a little too expensive for it.
I like the coffee, but...
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!). Even the additional plastic waste (packed separately, see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and collects full points soon.
It's my alarm clock.
The alarm clock was quick to come on and everything is easy to set. But: the natural noises sound awful and extremely loud. I also couldn't mute them. Probably a defect, supposedly it is possible. The softest radio setting was too loud for me so I fall out of bed right away. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the walls with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. But then when it was time to turn my face to it and the sunrise simulation started, it immediately struck me. The bright colors and also the color change were nice, unfortunately you can't colour the light. I found that it had a good battery so it didn't go out at one hour, so I had to reinstate the time of the wake.
Light super, processing not enough
I replaced four lamps in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately I could only replace four because the other two were delivered without a cover - instead a board laughs at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "6 pay - 4 received" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have handled this neatly and quickly, but I only found out after the return deadline. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - thus far the only reason for a 2 star deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and uniformly illuminated. The light is more in cold white. It should be perfect for floors, workshops, bathrooms, kitchens, etc. I would like to personally evaluate the housing to be warmer with the help of Durchaus Light. I am very happy to compare it with a 100 good old birch lamps, and I can also try and get a positive answer quickly on all the other questions. However, I think I will be able to answer this quickly.
That's great.
I've received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I have thought long and hard about whether to order this set or not. ** The material is sturdy, and it fits well in the hand. ** The utensils all have holes in the handle to be able to hang them. ** The soft silicone doesn't scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical for use on coated pans. ** They are heat-resistant and can be used up to 440 °F. ** They don't carry heat either and can be touched directly. ** However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone.
B goods sold as new goods
Amazon Prime delivery easily tip. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked faucet and tested all the parts.In the process we discovered that the part had already been built before. On all the assembly parts we had to detect significant scratches, erosion. The screws / connections of the pipes were all damaged. Despite this, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that even on the chrome faucet itself there are scratch marks / flakes. This part has probably been delivered already and sent back again. We keep this faucet and build it in the basin in the cellar because there is one no matter how it looks. Imprudent order; never order such goods via amazon again but we prefer to give more from the original product in our shop, just so that customers will be frightened!
The product itself is excellent, but the external sensor is broken after 6 months
Basically I am very happy with this product. Installation was very simple and the phone width is also very good, there are no problems with transmitting from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can be mounted on the wall or mounted as a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. However, the thermometer still seems intact, here plausible values are still shown. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is quite right because the extremely high humidity of the air is always shown on the outside. It's a pity that the device is fixed outside at one place and this is the reason why I only gave this product two stars.
Strong mower with a weak fishing basket
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt of the stand is still going through the Republic today with Hermes, unable to find its way back to me or to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a spare delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly at me and made a good impression. The engine is powerful and the result is a nice cross-section. The volume is not exactly impressive low, but ok. Unfortunately the catch basket is a big problem. For one, it is only top and bottom of hard plastic and in between of fabric. If you fully remove it only for a short time, it will, of course, be crushed and parts of the contents will fall out. It is very bad, but actually the practical filling level is half an inch already eaten full. I think it would be unsuccessful to fully remove a small piece of material through the design of the basket, so, if this is not so bad, then it will not be very good for the large size of the cut, but not always for the use of large parts, and I would have to reconsider.
Good equipment for surveillance
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate through the app. Very good is the included insertable sensor cable, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is built solid. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to spare the battery are displayed only once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I give only 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be locked quite dimly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect again even when you put it in the router. The batteries have to be removed and reconnected after a short break. If the battery is lost, then the alarm should work again.
This is a 3D printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I still haven't been able to level the hotbed properly. The right rear fixing screw is fully engaged, although the hotbed is still too high, and on the right the screw practically falls out because it is not at all engaged, although the hotbed is still too low. The rods hold the car straight, as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what to do because it is impossible to print something this way. For the construction: The construction was fairly trouble-free, I could only show how to lay the cables because you would have to reposition them several times, which is very stressful. I wrote to support, too, but after a week of waiting I still didn't receive an answer. Sorry, I don't have a hat. I'm not expecting anything either.
robust and precise I am positively surprised
Unfortunately my old slide failed to produce the necessary results after many years of use, so I had to buy a new one. This one gives a very robust impression, and after several test measurements it is just as accurate. It comes with two batteries, so that it can be launched immediately. The packaging of the slide is simple, but it fulfills its purpose completely. Otherwise, the slide leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full credit, and I think it will last at least as long as the old slide. From now on there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell of food
bought the bracelet and for the time being I have not worn it, because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day it is not gone even though it was constantly "ventilated". After it was no longer possible to return, I have disposed of it.
For the price, okay
The stars and spheres on this chain are a little too big for me personally, so it looks very solid. The bigger spheres are free to move, which I like very much. However, the chain is very easy to handle, so I've already torn the closure off twice. So far I've been able to repair it over and over again, but I don't think this will last well for very long. But for the low price you simply cannot expect anything of high quality.
What a beautiful piece of jewellery.
A beautifully made band and the simple lock actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't get up, amazing! I rubbed it in with some leather care, making it a little softer and more supple. Just: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the lock is made of steel!
Alas! I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that this is used goods. The base station was in order. Now about the function: connect only after some tinkering.... follow the instructions it does not work at all, until after I have removed a battery from the base station again and had reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because after an hour, the connection was lost, and that even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also the display of the three stations was very different! That was not so useful for me!
Damage caused by transport
Hi, I had this garden pump once, unfortunately after three and a half years the thread of the inner shaft had rusted away. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew that the suction line and drainage connections would be suitable. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and the current pump would fulfill its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the air-tight compartment was broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend that the pump in the future be packed a little better than using a thin-walled board. I kept the pump however, as described above, despite the fact that I urgently needed the pump and the rust material inside the pump so it did not affect the performance of the pump.
If only one could have thought better, since I often deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than to run around all the time with a large bundle of keys. In the beginning everything went very well. But then the paint wore out quite quickly and the screws had to be pulled again and again. Good, this works with a penny, but only with a penny. I have not found a suitable slot screwdriver that would not have immediately ruined the whole screw. Now, to come to the most important thing of the whole thing: the fastening of the key. The beauty of this is that you can put the screw through the different parts, the screw on different sizes or lengths, but then the whole thing should have screwed up, but then you can take another to bring the whole thing back together. It is possible to put the key together again, but it is uncomfortable for me, and then, the final thing: once all the screws are removed, you will never be able to balance it with the whole thing.
Not fully conform to the dimensions specified
Easy-to-use zippers, the material looks sturdy and everything is in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually assess the product after the first use. At first I can say that the height is lower than specified. At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there for example for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly in the case - as usual. It should be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, because in the round cosmetic bag there were still two smaller bags / bags. Not high-quality finished, I wanted to mention this. However, the fact that the cosmetic bag has a different tone and is made of a different material, the bags are expensive, does not bother me personally. Moreover I see the price-performance ratio as being ok.
So there
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas, and now when I wanted to use it again, it didn't, but, it still doesn't work, so the money I could've just dumped directly in the trash.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I could not hear an improvement in the sound on my very high quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are perfectly protected. With them, two black cables. The battery life is very long. Definitely perfect sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time, and therefore they are very comfortable. The earmuffs are totally soft and comfortable to wear. Also, the weight is very low. Recommendation to buy in this price range.
Nice dress.
Very nice dress that wears well on most occasions.. the price/performance matches exactly, especially since I bought it during the flash sale. It fits my size perfectly, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (which you would have recommended). I wish the cut wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could tolerate a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper sleeves as the model in the picture). But overall it's a nice dress for many occasions.
It's all over. It can't get any worse. I really and truly didn't expect this junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It's assumed that the USB ports supply enough power. However, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVDs usually run, Blu-rays are detected to an unreliable maximum. The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes a squeaking noise you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a couple of minutes you can either restart the computer because nothing is detected or it is finally detected. But in no case should you ever push a button or pause during a chapter or alter the sound during the movie, just as, of course, a Blu-ray Disc does not contain any additional cost-free software or if it comes with a Blu-ray Disc, you cannot change the sound immediately.
it does what it's supposed to but it's not pretty. first of all I would like to point out that these two USB ports are actually quite an eyesore, because only one port that faces upwards is a USB port. the other plug is just there for charging any devices there and so relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I actually need a second port and if I only needed a tiny extension, I surely wouldn't have bought these shabby lumps with gold plugs. but aside from the look and my miscalculation, the extension performs its service very reliably. and due to the weight of the plug, the built in USB stick doesn't simply extend around like the ones with a normal extension, which is fine. but my real mistake is that it keeps in tight place. (laughs)
Small but oho! I bought this product so that on my iPad (Pro) I can connect an audio output and a display. With IOS 12 you can now also pass data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters, which I had to send back already, could not regretfully this. Practically it is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Audio is delivered via HDMI. What I use my PlayStation P for: There was a small adapter which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and has a magnetic support. My shell does not fit with the adapter. Well also keeps the case from contact and therefore... Everything is very stable and expensive, however, because something in the middle is completely wireless. All the aluminum is still very much justified in one piece. Performance in one small price.
Any quantity of power
It runs for months with no problems. It's not light or quiet, but it gives a lot of power. I find the temperature setting to be a little too cool, so I'm always on level two. It's also been dropped on the floor many times and has survived well. And I also like the simplicity of its design. Competitors like to look like space ships.
Very good.
The workmanship of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference is very large compared to the original, but it does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with a weak battery.
We've been using the Tracker for about six months and are positively surprised in live mode, the positioning feels to be 0.5m accurate. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters which is not disturbing. I would buy it at any time. But what would be great, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently it lasts about 1.5 days. Here would be a great solution that would last 7-14 days. While there is an XL version but unfortunately this is too large for our taste, so the battery would not last with us and we also find it inconvenient to change it every day. You should not deal with the dog with his necklace :-) The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks, garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the life cycle decreases more and more. Although my son only wears them in exercise class, after a few weeks the sole breaks and the shoes cannot be used anymore. The last pair was of similarly ordinary use, they didn't last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the lessons. Unfortunately that was not true. The shoes are more expensive trash and totally not to recommend.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after five years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly made at first glance. They are as comfortable as the ones I owned before. At first glance, you may not see any difference, but at second glance you notice the edges are poorly made, and the restraint on the heel is quite loose, and very likely will not last five years like mine. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good.
Since there are hardly any reviews yet to read, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am going to a festival this year and I would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it anyway out of the goodness of my heart. As part of the delivery, the mattresses and an automotive air pump were included. Regarding the mattress, I tested it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hoped that it would not reappear. In the inflated condition, a direct delivery test was performed. It lays well on it and fits perfectly to the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace the hard bed, but for the own days at the event it is very pure of luxury. Since the mattress fits miraculously into the back seat of my car. Before we had the pumps, it fits perfectly with my car.
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar from me gets only two stars.:( first, for quick shipping; second, for the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar was torn open by the lapidary processing directly on day one on multiple doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the rest of the pieces accordingly because it was almost already satisfactory to him. The parts often come out wrong which often means you have to rebuild the car again in order to fix the parts. After the car is completely assembled, the parts fall out while playing. (The front decoration is the most important. This one also fits very poorly.) I would not buy this calendar anymore and recommend it to anyone.
a real drone
I am excited about the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies it. Inside it flies very well and the five-minute flight time is usually completely adequate. The fact that hair becomes trapped in it and the drone breaks very quickly I did not expect anything different at this price, but falling from the ceiling to the ground, whether tile or carpet, is not a problem. In case of questions, a nice contact.
game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. did not see when buying that it is not a game CD but merely a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam to be able to play at all, which is a disgrace. Since then the computer is constantly hanging, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails on the battery life.
I was looking forward to the watch very much. Design and looks great, news etc were easily displayed. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. Three big hooks: the battery and its running time. Charged in the evening, laid only on the drm cabinet overnight and in the morning 11% less battery if not used. Got many news in the day, the battery was already in the midday / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time. Therefore, not useful for me. Very bad.
Noble cover with restrictions
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10 +, you absolutely should wear a case. I recently liked case where you can also place the credit card. This is provided by the case here. If you insert cards in all 3 boxes, it becomes too much, then the cover is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather case gives a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks classy. The phone is unlike many other cases around, only at the connections are gaps. Otherwise, you can easily control the single-board and silencer on the side through the case. The disadvantage is that even on QI boxes it is not possible, through the thickness of the case, to charge the phone. You can only charge the phone well from the case. It does not work as well as other accessories.
a high quality casing with glass foil
Strong case with a proper armored glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily pulled up. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not pollute. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and is firmly attached to the phone. Overall a good purchase.
