Located in the mountainous area, Nakita Farm in Kagamijo County is mostly a gradual field with no good soil.
These farms had an unprecedented harvest last year
It is a major achievement of the Kiyotsu Central Zoo Feed Safeguarding Plant.
The plant was established in 2011 with the mission of sending feed seafood to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
In recent years, it has supported farms in Kiyotsu City, such as the procurement of agricultural supplies.
However, it was not Kiyotsu City, but a farm in Kagamijo County adjacent to the city.
And I decided to help with the "dividing" of the rustic farm, which is said to be the strictest condition in the county.

FUJI Preventing Accidents System Development In-house Vehicles FUJI Economic Newspapers Aichi, Gifu, Mie, and Shizuoka
FUJI (headquartered in Chitate City), which manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has begun developing a system to prevent "leftover" such as children being left behind in cars.
When a person's sensor is installed in the car and a person's movement is detected, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, a demonstration experiment is carried out at the transfer vehicle of the company's facility.
In the event of a painful accident caused by leaving behind, we will protect the safety of children.
Currently, we are conducting demonstration experiments at two transfer vehicles of Teracoya THANK, an English conversation after-school for children operated in Ichidate City.
A sensor that detects the movement of people from the temperature difference between people and the surroundings is installed in three ceilings in the car.
When the engine of the vehicle is cut and the door is closed, a person's movement is detected after a certain time has passed, a warning notice is automatically sent.
By linking the state and information of the engine and the door, it prevents incorrect detection as much as possible.
Warning notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling the registered number in advance, it is displayed in a chat on a computer or smartphone.
You can register multiple addresses and take care not to make mistakes such as missed.
The trial will continue until the end of February.
Kazumitsu Kamiya, head of the Division 2 of the Innovation Promotion Department, pointed out, "We have also seen peripheral issues other than the system during the experiment."
For example, he was able to pick up various issues related to school bus, such as creating an environment where drivers can focus on driving.
If we want to expand our solutions, we can do our best."
One of the reasons for the development of the leftover prevention system was the leaving of one bus to another across the country.
There were suggestions from employees with young children that they could do anything to protect their children's safety.
We decided to develop this technology in order to utilize our know-how, such as information management using IoT (Internet of Things) and sensors, cultivated through FA (factory automation) -related businesses.
FUJI's preventive system is easy to sell.
The sensor can be installed with a pin on the ceiling.
It is possible to easily rearrange the transfer vehicle so that the hurdle of introduction is reduced and it is aimed at dissemination.
Going forward, we will consider commercialization, with cooperation from nurseries and kindergartens.
[Discussion] Atsuga, the Hokuriku Shinkansen line, which was originally scheduled for fiscal 2023, was sent off, and the construction of a town west of Atsuga in Fukui Prefecture is beginning to occur.
In Kohama City, where a new station is set up, the location of the detailed station is not yet shown, and urban planning has been implemented, including the maintenance of the surrounding area.
It is expected to take a long time to develop a plan, and it is necessary to publish it as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station, which is scheduled for Obama City, will be the only new station west of Atsuga.
In 19, the Japan Railway Construction and Transport Facilities Development Organization indicated that the station was within a radius of about 2 and 5 kilometers, mainly at JR Higashikohama Station.
The location and route of the station were planned for winter 22.
In Kohama City, the business related to the Shinkansen line, which opened in Atsuga and opened in the future, was fully established in FY21.
The initial budget for FY22 will further increase the number of businesses, and we are trying to build a town that expects the position of the new station to be announced.
However, the details of the new station are not yet shown.
The city is considering land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station, and as a business that formulates a basic plan, it is expected to receive 3 million yen in the budget this year, but it is expected to be unenforceable.
The city plan, centered on the new station, "takes a long time to establish a civil agreement" (the city manager).
There are cases of Echizen City in the newly established suburban stations in the prefecture that do not have existing JR stations, but it can be said that it takes a considerable amount of time to summarize the overall concept.
It is a concern that the later it is announced, the shorter the preparation period will be until the opening, and the impact will be on the surrounding area.
Before the location of the new station, there is uncertainty about the extension west of Atsuga.
In October of last year, a municipal group in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted a signature to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism requesting the withdrawal of the white paper of the extension plan.
In the Ishikawa Prefectural government, there was a call for a reconsideration of the Yonehara route, and so on, so there was a series of movements to restore the route setting that had been settled, and it is difficult to say that the neighboring prefecture is a single rock.
Although it is relatively calm for the residents of Kohama to take notice of the start of construction, the location of the new station is unknown, and if the opening period remains unclear, it may be affected by the future momentum.
Mayor Akiharu Matsuzaki will continue his requests to the country for the opening of the entire line at an early stage.
With the indifference that "the Shinkansen will pass by someday (west of Atsuga) ," it is impossible to move the country and neighboring prefecture municipalities.
I want the enthusiasm to keep raising my voice.

Before Valentine's Day on February 14th, the price of chocolates has risen due to the rising cost of raw materials and packaging materials.

"I'm trying to create a sales office where you can enjoy the Valentine's event itself."
The store has been selling recommended sweets from January 26 and resumed tasting for the first time in three years.
Kurabu (headquartered in Ichihondanaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai City) was the first to launch a series of original chocolates called KISEKI (KISEKI), which was jointly developed with a long-established chocolate manufacturer in France at the end of last year.
It is characterized by a fruity taste that is focused on cacao beans and suppresses bitterness, and is sold for three thousand yen and nine thousand yen.
Mr. Ryuma Takakura, Director of the Company's purchasing department, said, "While the culture of Giri Chocolate has gradually faded, there is a demand that we enjoy a little bit of a good taste on Valentine's Day.We will increase the added value of our products and try to differentiate it."

The site of Ushigahara-jo Castle, which is said to have been built to prepare for the battle against Heizei-ji Temple, Ushigahara, Fukui Prefecture
Inuikawa area of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture was once a large Ushigahara shoen.
Ushigahara-jo Castle is said to have been built in the middle of Mt. potbed in the area to prepare for the battle against Heizei-ji Temple, which was in conflict with shoen during the Kamakura period.
He appears in the'Taiheiki' (Taipei-ki) of the war chronicle.
There is no document on Ushigahara-jo Castle, but the following is written in'Echizen Ushihara Jito no jito' in volume 11 of Taiheiki.
Awakawa Ukyo no Suketokiru, who was an official of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), was sent to Ono as Jito.
In 1333, Takauji ASHIKAGA overthrew the Rokuhara Tandai, which was established in Kyoto to monitor the Imperial Court and control the western provinces, and the Kamakura bakufu was overthrown by Yoshisada NITTA.
When he heard the news that Rokuhara Tandai had been destroyed, his vassals ran away and only about 20 remained.
Sobei of Heizei-ji Temple attacked the gap.
Tokiharu went after his wife and two children when he entered the river and later committed suicide.
⇒ A difficult castle with Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu.
In 2014, the local community issued a'dry side history.'
The story of Tokiharu is introduced in comics so that it is easy for elementary school students to understand.
Masao Kitagawa, 75, who was involved in the publication, said, "I want people in the region to know the familiar history and pass it on to later generations."
"Fukui Castle Tour" to learn and enjoy castles in Fukui Prefecture
Ushigahara Castle
At the site of the castle, you can go on a mountain trail with a well-maintained association on the dry side.
It is about 200 meters from the entrance.
The road leading to the entrance of the mountain is sometimes not accessible due to snow accumulation in winter.
A meeting to make the dry side better
There are approximately 220 houses in the area.
In the past, "Tricetsu on the dry side" was issued to introduce the tumulus, historical sites and highlights in the district.
Rennyo no Sato Awara, a road station under construction in Yoshizaki, Fukui Prefecture, will open on April 22.
With the opening of Ashihara Onsen Station on the Hokuriku Shinkansen in the spring of 2024, the station expects about 360,000 users per year as a new regional promotion and tourism base in the northern part of the city.
The main food and beverage facilities of the station are steel-framed flats with a total floor area of 975 square meters.
The area of the entire road station, including the parking lot and Nagisa Children's Park, is 8137 square meters.
The facility also has a rest area and a tourist information center.
Electric bicycles can be rented and shower rooms are also available.
The two parking lots accommodate a total of 66 small cars and large cars (including three for disabled people).
The mayor of the city, Morinotsugu, made it clear at a regular meeting held on February 8.
In the food and beverage corner, parfait using fruits from the northern hills of Sakai, and pie at Mitsuki are sold.
We are working to develop a menu that uses a lot of local things, such as egg kake gohan using Fukuchi chicken, and autumn/winter-only dishes using eels from Kitagata.
There are currently about 60 companies in the "shipper council" of the direct sales office.
It also enhances the taste of processed products such as bento and general vegetables, and agricultural gardens such as seedlings and trees.
The Souvenir Corner exhibits and sells the works of artists from the Mori Art Museum of Kanazu, and deals with confectionery, sake, and traditional crafts.

At the meeting, Mayor Mori said, "We will restore and enhance the energy and vitality of the entire city, and lead to the improvement of the lives of local residents and the revitalization of the region."
A cat-shaped distribution robot introduced at the "Iwashio ripening gingi skanbonta Fukui Station Mae store."
Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a shortage of workers, there is a movement to introduce a rationing robot carrying dishes to customers' seats.
It is said that it helps customers to save labor in store operation and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and that the adorable expression of robots is well received by family customers.
Restaurant owners and stakeholders say that "local restaurants are difficult to secure employees and part-time workers, and distribution robots will become even more popular."
"Zin, Zin, Jingiskang!"
A robot displaying a cat's face on the screen, while sounding light music, ran smoothly in the store.
When they arrive at the table, they talk to customers, such as "I brought you the food you ordered."
The "Iwashio ripening gingi kanbonta Fukui station store" of Ote 2-chome, Fukui City introduced a cat-shaped distribution robot in August 2022.
When a robot is waiting near the cooking ground and presses the table number on the screen, it is delivered autonomously to the table.
The AI (artificial intelligence) voice function is built-in, and when the customer touches it, it reacts and the expression of the cat's face reflected on the screen is rich.
The "Bonta Group," which runs the same store, has introduced distribution robots in two stores, including the same store.
President Toshiyuki Saito emphasized that the reason for the introduction was "the largest labor shortage" and that it was part of productivity improvement through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to sales of stores is usually about 30%, but the introduction of the system has reduced it from 21 to 22%.
The robot also has a role in collecting dishes that the customer has finished eating, which leads to the efficiency of cleaning up, and adds that "the family and children have joy and publicity."
The Rokuma Hoshiyama Fukui store, a grilled meat and hormone pot located in Shinbo-cho, Fukui City, was introduced in August 22.
Mr. Nagafuku Hoshiyama, president of Sonsan Shopping Co., Ltd., said, "We can't come here even if we recruit employees or part-time workers. We thought it would be absolutely necessary to eliminate the labor shortage."
In the Fukui store, it is operated by dividing the zone that employees provide and the range of robot delivery.
It is said that the lease fee for robots is about the same as that for one part-time employee.
In order to save labor, in addition to robots at stores, we are also considering ordering systems using tablet terminals.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, customer service, such as restaurants and restaurants, was 6.94 times higher than in December 22, 2010, and a high sense of labor shortages.
A person in charge of the network system (Takagi Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which is responsible for selling distribution robots, said, "The labor shortage of restaurants in the prefecture has become serious due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there are many inquiries regarding the introduction of robots."
President Hoshiyama analyzed that local suburban stores will become even more difficult to secure employees, and distribution robots will become more popular.
[Discussion] Echizen Town has made an ending note and distributes it to the townspeople who want it.
When I published the "Okuyami Handbook" last year, which covered the necessary procedures, written heritage lists, family tree, etc. when I passed away, many people came to receive it for themselves.
In many places in the prefecture, lectures on how to write and organize ending notes are often held, and "Enkatsu" seems to be completely established in the prefecture.
Echizen Town's ending note is page 35.
In chapter 5, we will start with a look back at our own history and write about our current health and asset status, care for the future, hope for end-of-life medical care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There are also columns that you want to do for the rest of your life and a message for the important person.
If you have 35 pages, it seems painful to write, but you don't have to fill all the pages.
What do you want to write most to people around you, including your family?
It is important to clarify the purpose.
In bookstores, various notes according to the purpose are marketed, and it is said that you can start writing freely from where you can write.
It was not until 2009 that the word "Enjoyment" was born in the same way as Narikatsu.
Two years later, the Great East Japan Earthquake struck in 11 years.
It is said that many people saw the reality that "death suddenly comes," and more people prepared for their own end and end.
It has been more than 10 years since then.
The COVID-19 pandemic, which struck the world, has not yet settled.
As prices rose due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, electricity bills this winter jumped to unthinkable prices.
Halfway through, wages haven't come up enough to meet the current highs in prices, and many are head-on.
On the other hand, it was used to be a funeral service, nursing care, and tomb management, which was previously shared by relatives, but it is not uncommon for a single child.
In addition, the life expectancy was significantly extended compared to a year ago, but the older the age, the greater the risk of dementia and caregiving, the dilemma.
It should be borne in mind that there is also a rise in social unrest in the background of the end-of-life period.
Anyway, everyone would hope that they don't want to put too much burden on their partners and children.
It seems to be a popular keyword of the ending note, but it is not possible to be too alone.
I would like to consult with my family once and prepare for it.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (second from right) and Minister of Education Katsurako Nagaoka (third) will attend a commemorative photo at the elementary school where he visited.
On February 10th, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture announced that mask-wearing for children and faculty members was not necessary at the graduation ceremony.
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) established the policy that mask-wearing for children and their children was "basic to not wear" at the graduation ceremony.
"It's actually difficult to take the interval between students widely, and we're worried about how we should respond. Some students feel uneasy about removing masks," the school's president said.
It is said that this topic has also been raised among faculty members after receiving reports about wearing masks at the graduation ceremony.
On the other hand, one elementary school director said, "If the country decides, it will not be worn.
At this graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to ease the measures by allowing current students to participate or resume chorus of graduates.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high is scheduled to be held in early March, and public elementary and junior highs will be held in the middle of the same year.
The Board of Governors and the Board of Governors are expected to respond by waiting for a formal notice from the Ministry of Education.
In addition, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has been cautious about the policy of not requiring mask-wearing throughout school education activities since the new semester this spring.
The primary school's director said, "From one day to another, children are confused because they suddenly don't have a mask.After deciding to wear it, the natural flow is that the number of children who remove it is increasing."
× x ×
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) on February 10 decided not to wear masks in school education activities since April in line with the new government guidelines for mask-wearing.
In principle, choirs, physical education classes, and club activities are not masked.
In FY2022, we will ask for infection control measures in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and we will inform the Board of Education and the school site of the precautions after April.
The graduation ceremony for elementary and junior high school and colleges, etc., is based on measures such as ventilation and other measures, and graduates, faculty members, and current students who participate are not allowed to wear masks.
Yasushi Nagata cuts the exam student (left) with a scissors who wished to pass the exam.=Hear atrium rim in Tsukamachi, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture
In the beauty salon Haer Atriemrim in Tsuka-cho, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, students are cut by using scissors to pray for passing.
It is said that the students were "confident" and "settled" to take the exam.
Yasushi Nagata, the representative director of the beauty salon, has seen and heard students open textbooks while waiting for cuts, and exude anxiety about exams during cuts.
As a result, in 2014 he began to cut his wish to pass.
The final date of the national public application
In the same beauty salon, she is asked to pray for the passing of Hasami and Kushi at Kazusa-sha Shrine in Wakatake-cho, the city on the first day of her work.
Around 80 people receive cuts each year.
It is said that there are various kinds of things such as high school, university entrance examination, job hunting, driver's license exam, etc.
He is given a pencil to pray for his passing.
Mama ogi, you're going to take high school exams.
In the 21st year, a man who received a cut and passed the University of Tokyo (19) looked back, "I was happy to see the feeling of cheering, and I used the gold pencil I received in the exams, and my feelings were strong."
'Dear Cabinet Minister,' from Tojinbo,' a book published by the NPO's Bunshu and Editing Bureau, which was self-published.
"Dear Prime Minister, I have published my 10th book with this title."
Each newspaper in the country has covered it, and many readers have been receiving feedback.
The purpose of this book was to create a "comfortable society" with all of you who shared with you the contents of the "social and structural" environmental issues in Japan.
We have been patrolling the rocky area for 18 years and 10 months to prevent suicide during the watershed of Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, which is called a famous place of suicide, and continue to support suicide plotters until they are found and protected.
This article summarizes the issues we have heard from 784 people (as of 6 February) who have protected so far.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "human life rescue" activities.
(2) "Human rights violations" are piled up behind suicide.
(3) Suicide is a victim of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat people who live outside the jurisdiction as "disobedients."
(5) Disabled persons such as depression are treated as "accidents" even if they commit suicide.
(6) "Safety obligations" in high-risk areas of suicide are oblivion and run into commercialism.
(7) The part that cannot be scientifically proven by the doctrine of an emerging religious group is deceit, and the act of threatening and providing money to the other person by telling them about the future is extortion.
Religious groups carrying out criminal acts of this "fraud and blackmail offense" should be published and eliminated.
For this reason, we have received comments from those who subscribed to this book, such as "I was moved by the strong mentality of the people working on this activity," "This former police officer's figure is a book of police officers," and "It is a Bodhisattva who is alive to support himself even though he is another person."
I saw a photo of a newspaper article and I was like, "What do you think..."
I'm hearing that there is an increasing number of suicides of people who have been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic.
It's really sad.
Everyone seems to be that person.
I hope it is a society where you can live your life with joy.
I felt respect and gratitude to all the staff who have done their best to those who have been so patient that they want to die.
I think this activity is an activity that is used harshly both physically and mentally, but please continue to speak to me after being narcissistic.
Thank you very much.
Kashiko
I hope that everyone who is a reader will become a gatekeeper of life in the region.

Kenji Shimada, 38, a resident of the city.
Starting in March 2021, the company began dissemination on the exchange site (SNS).
Kapiburgh is one of the world's largest rats, with a water whirlpool between his fingers and a good swim.
From 18 years after opening in Hapijan, a total of three males and two females have been raised, allowing them to observe and feed in close proximity.
Shimada learned about Kapibara five or six years ago.
He said he was shocked to see a video of him relaxing in a hot spring and saying, "What is this animal?"
It was drawn by the adorable expressions and shigusa like humans.
After that, he heard that he was raised in Hapijan and was looking forward to seeing it nearby.
About three years ago, I bought a SLR camera.
It is used to capture the adorable figure of Kapibara, and does not miss the shutter chance, such as the appearance of bruble and seismic body and cutting water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram has risen to about 830, and it is enough to look back, "I often take this."
Do you remember Mr. Shimada as you went through the footsteps?
"It's cute and nice," said Shimada's capybara love.

[Toba] On the 10th, Toba City announced that a total of 600,000 yen had been provided to 12 11 households for the special benefit for child-rearing households (other households) in FY2020.
The city provides an apology and explanation of the circumstances to the Target Company and seeks procedures for return.
According to the city, it was discovered by a guardian of the eligible child who confirmed the past deposit on January 27, Reiwa 5.
After confirming 182 of the 79 eligible households for the same year, it was said that 12 of the 11 households were given double benefits on July 20, 2020.

Introduction of plant research Origins of Mt. Hayaike Mt.
The exhibition "People who introduced the flowers of Hayaike Peak - the history of the early pond peak plant research," which is known as the treasure trove of Takayama plants, is held until 12th at the City Cultural Property Center in Osamu-cho, Hanamaki City.
He collected 124 materials, including valuable specimens collected by his predecessors, and introduced the footsteps of his predecessors who were involved in plant research on Mt. Hayaike Peak.
The plant research of Mt. Hayaike began at the end of the Edo period with Karl Johan Maximovic (1827-91), a Russian plant researcher who came to Japan, and Naganosuke Sugawa (1842-1925), who was from Shiwa-cho, who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovic.
Maximovic, who was not allowed to walk freely in Japan for foreigners, asked Sugawa to collect and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa continued to support the research after returning to Maximovic, leading to the announcement of'Himekozakra', 'Nambutou Chiso' and'Miyayamabukishoma', which are unique to Mt. Hayaike.
Later, Tomotaro MAKINO (1862-1957), a modern plant classification scholar, published'Nambutranoo,' 'Kobanotsumekusa,' 'Nambuinunazuna,' and'Katohakobe,' which he discovered and named on Mt. Hayaike in 1903.
The exhibition materials show that many researchers have revealed valuable alpine plants.
In addition, he introduced Shichiro Tamagawa (1914-88), who served as a curator of the Tachiyama Museum of Osamu Town and was involved in the publication of "Waike Peak Plants," which accompanied the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 1972.
"There is a lot of research in the background of each plant of Mt. Hayaike, and there is a connection between people and people.
The exhibition consists of four chapters, and in chapter one, the faith and history of Hayaike Peak, and chapter two, based on the survey of German geologist Heinrich Edmund Nauman (1854-1927), who laid the foundations for Japanese geology, also has a spot on the features of Mt. Hayaike Peak from the geological perspective.

In response to this, the Council held its first meeting in November last year, aiming to develop a plan ahead of six other remote airports in the prefecture.
The second meeting is not open, except at the beginning.
At the meeting, Mr. Ando confirmed the greenhouse gas emissions of the airport.
It is said that talks were carried out in line with the guidelines of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to set targets and introduce renewable energy.

It was the first time in Kyushu to open a branch office.
It is the first island in the country.
The event was attended by about 20 people, including staff from On-Co and Tsuginova, Japanese-style nights, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background of the opening of the branch office, saying, "With the movement to attract people from outside the island becoming active, I thought that if we could utilize vacant houses and vacant stores, the town would be more excited."
"We connect with people who have properties on the island and want to do something," he said. "We want to help each single person move forward with that effort."
Mr. Takeshi Mizutani, President of On-Co, pointed out that it is important to take care of each vacant house, and to talk about what local people want to do in the area, what kind of people want to come, and what criteria to choose.
"The deeper the connection between people and people, the more information comes together," he said, calling on the islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

Body type is H175m W80kg I bought L size.
I struggle quite a bit at first to wear it, but I think it's OK if I get used to it.
I used it for a few days, but now I am using other pressure inners because of problems.
The problem is that if the arm is not quite thin, the tightening around the sleeve (just two arms) is too tight, and it is itchy.
2, the lower abdomen is loose.
It's pretty tight when it comes to comfort, but it's fine to sleep while wearing it.
It's a good idea for a good person.
Even 158cm and 50kg were OK.
But the skeleton was big, and it didn't fit me as muscular.
It is not three-dimensional making such as buttocks, so it is not easy to make strange gaps or fall.
I always felt like I had to pull up on top.
I think it's good if you're a body-shaped person like a stick.
Isn't it a thick, secure thinness?
It wasn't like henna or breaking, but I was able to boot in even a nice sneaky boot, and I was able to make it clear.
It's lovely.
In the upper body, I didn't want to get my skin out too much, but I was looking for something different from my fitness swimsuit.
At the top is the back figure of the knitting and the one-point mark on the hem.

Did you change the model from pat to place?
(^.
Thank you very much!
It is a little larger in size at 45kg156cmM.
The raincoat is a thick fabric, so it feels steamy and hot, but because the method is solid, I think it can be used for a long period of time.
It had two rainy visors to prevent my face from getting wet.
The strength was fine, and I was able to use it with peace of mind even on a bicycle in a storm.
I never broke it after use.
I put it in a compressed bag and carry it in a compact state.
Really, it was more than expected at this price.
I was able to wear it safely.

At the time of the re-challenge, I was able to make a quick effort with a wide-ranging plier as shown in the photo in the instructions.
When I got the last main unit back in the car, there was a bit of wiring storage, but I managed to put it on.
DVDs, TVs and navigators can be seen while driving without any problems after installation.
If you ask at Daehler, it will cost 80,000 yen over, and even a specialty store will cost over 40,000 yen.
Fee below
To be honest, I don't know why this is such a high rating. First of all, it's poly, but there's a fluffy section and a scissor in the cushion. It seems to have already been used. It's a lot of waste, and I thought I'd use it for a trial, but I think if you don't use the product with the head and the pillow part for a try, it's not fit. I thought that pillows and pillows would be a different one.
It's not possible.
Goods arrive.
It was used as soon as possible.
You can milk properly without problems with the sense of use.
However, there are times when the sound is a little complicated and the power button reacts poorly.
I don't care because I can use it without any problems, but people who care may be bothered.
It is not super quiet, 😅 but if you use it all night, you may use it a little.
Also, I was worried about whether the attached tube and the part connecting with the machine would enter the tube, but I entered it in a push-up form 😂 I think it is easy to carry it because it is lightweight!
I need a trick to whisk.
I'm not sure if my hair quality is the worst and the performance of this shampoo is a problem, but it doesn't bubble up enough to say it's completely in normal use.
(The shampoo I've used so far has bubbled up without any problems using it normally.)
(At this point, it does not bubble at a level that does not appear one of the bubbles) Rinse the hair once, then take the shampoo in a suitable way and familiarize yourself with the hair.
Well, in short, I wash twice.
It's clear that I bought a shampoo that was so expensive, but there was clearly a sense of a better touch of hair.
However, it is an honest impression that I was not satisfied when I reviewed it.

The front side of the blade is cleaned by the cleaner of the blade.
I think matching is good with kamisori with good accuracy of the original blade.
Posi: You can get dirt on the blade, such as sebum, soap cass, etc. as you want.
(Although it is only on the surface side) It will last for a long time if it has a bad taste.
Nega: The life of the smoother decreases to an extreme.
Coatings such as titanium coats and ceramic coats make the coating easier to peel.
(The coating is almost peeled off if you use the rinse about 2-3 times, so I think it is better to use this cleaner after that.)
Please note that the razor is written that you should not wipe the cutting edge.
Costs When you can replace it with a tipping prevention rubber (vibration rubber) that is placed under furniture used to prepare for earthquakes, it feels like performance.
The life expectancy of the razor is 20-30%.
It is difficult to determine when discarding the blade of the razor, but I think that damage was added to the blade due to the wrinkle, and the tip of the blade became tough.
In that sense, I think it's a good product because it can prevent drying down due to dirt.
(It does not have the effect of grinding with a cleaner.Sometimes it feels sharpened, but it seems to feel like a small rust.)
A tv commercial...
I bought it when I saw a pretty old woman's face attracting just once in a TV commercial.
When I actually used it, the texture solidified a little bit more than the normal gel, and I used it with pre-rotation.
At first, it feels disgusting, but if you apply it while massage, it will come into the skin unexpectedly.
After entering, there was almost no sticking, and my skin was sucked into my hands.
The lift-up was not like TV.
I felt a sense of hali once.
Because it is super dry skin, it is not enough for this one, and I have used it since using a certain moisture surge 72 before this.
It's just a good feeling.
I was expecting the relaxation of the pores to be covered, but it will not be covered.
I think if you use a bottle, it will be effective, or if there are any, I think there is a ripi.
I think it was very difficult to put it together, but...
It's a labor that looks back and summarizes the remarks of politicians over the past few years.
As I read it, I somehow convinced myself that the words at that time were finally ah.
However, if you consider the value as a reading, it is subtle to say that the "fact check" that the authors call is enough.
To be honest, it is not interesting to read.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the big drawback of the book was in the "method."
What we call "facts" here is ultimately unknown to anyone whether it is true forever.
I felt quite suspicious of the brittleness of "fact check" (also known as "disprobability") because I was aware of it.
It feels a bit dark when the perception of the current Japanese reporters' "facts" is at this level.
It seems that many people recommend it, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge about the contents of this book.
As a reviewer, if you have a reader who is interested in the "fact check" conducted by the current Japanese press, I think this book is not fit.
To those who do not increase the number of points in the model trial.
In my school, the political economy was a print method, and I didn't really find it boring in the form of a class that I was studying while doing, and I really disliked the political economy.
To be honest, I was saved in this reference.
Currently, this year's center at High 3.
After buying it in March, I chose this as my partner for an hour's study at school.
First impression is a simple word.
You have reached the realm of God.
When I got to the last question after one lap, I averaged 70 at the time.
I was amazed by Yuseki.
It grows as much as it eats weird things.
I was able to realize from my skin that what I get in this reference book is not only knowledge and information about political and economics, but also increased motivation for my ability and study.
Thank you for making me see you.
Protection
I experienced two attempts to pick up the doorstep eight years ago, and I've been doing security measures.
This time, it's a buyback from the camera I bought eight years ago.
Previously, infrared irradiation 30m type (other companies) was used.
This product was written by other people, but the distance to be able to recognize the face at night is about 5 meters.
I agree.
We haven't even set up until we just arrived, but we have compared and checked the reflection of the camera.
The image quality is much better than the camera eight years ago (no doubt).
The 32-inch monitor shows four splits, but if you maximise the shooting size, it is a problem.
For now, the product is defective.
If you are considering a level of facial recognition other than crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied with shooting at night, especially if this price is the highest!
I am for security measures, but I do not require facial recognition.
Because I can't understand if I was covered or masked (especially at night).
Professional empty nests (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
Even small, high-performance cameras and recordings will be identified.
Conversely, it is difficult to be a professional.
However, these days, empty nests are bold and clever, so it is recommended to use them in combination with various security goods, rather than relying solely on cameras.
For example, it is a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained for about 1,500 yen at the home center (the latest is very bright, 6 combinations).
Because it is solar, it does not require electricity, but it does not turn on until the morning in winter, so there are also three 100V LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30 meters to recognize the shadow.
Also, if you think that you can feel that the camera is small and the intimidation effect is thin, you need a cover by ingenuity.
I have a sticker with a "24-hour security camera operation."
It is an original product of a security camera manufacturer that used to be used.
It has a more effective effect on manufacturers than pasting what is sold at home centers.
The place to stick is a thief's intrusion road that would not be covered by camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
At the same time, it was negative because it is difficult to understand the explanation of the net setting.
If there are any defects after setting up or setting up, we will post it.
The harder you read, the more empathy
If she was born in 82 years in Japan, the situation may be a little better than that of her, but it is still far from even because the Equal Rights Act on Gender Employment came into effect.
As I read it, the painful memories that I had lived through discrimination as a working person were resurrected and I was suffering.
Not only in Korea and Japan, but also in a feudal society, it depicts the suffering of all women trying to live as humans, not as women.
At least it's time for women alone to stop emotional conflicts and stand up to this society.
A drama that thinks that a man is the worst
The story of the main character who was sexually abused by his biological father as a child.
As a result, he continues to drag his wounds even when he is an adult.
Everyone who comes out is the lowest.
The husband of the main character, who is warm and family-minded, is also the lowest in some ways.
In the end, the main character's sister, who knows that she is receiving DV from her husband, ignores it, and her sister-in-law finally comes to the police to sue her husband, but the main character's husband, who is a police officer, is irritated by the men.
The elder mother of the main character, who pretends to be a bokeh, knows the fact that her husband (the main character's biological father) was killed by her daughter, but she does not know it (publicly, her father's death is a drug overdose).
In short, after the death of Rape Oyaji, it seems that she never let her daughter receive counseling, and it is natural that the main character becomes funny.
Do you want to hear about the grandfather who died when the main character's daughter did?
Do you care about ojii who died so young?
Among the dramas? Too much.
A few years ago, a heat wave hit France. Many old people died, and many French people said that even if they contacted their daughter and son, "I can't pull it because it's a vacation."
These people are "dry."
At the end of the drama, I looked at my husband and daughter and felt like it was "dry."
In France, unlike in the United States, there are many things that give a good afterthought, but I saw a lot of scenes where I thought it would be better to cut it.
Professional boundaries
If a detailed calculation and an unexpected accident that could not be read was involved in someone's life, I guess I was prepared to bet on myself even if I had calculated it from the beginning.
The script, which embodied such a shaky drama of how much she deceived her surroundings in order to pass her own beliefs, was wonderful.
Jessica's acting is really amazing.
No matter what you look at, there is no doubt.
It's a professional job.
And then it failed.
I used three cars so far, but this product was broken in a hurry, whether it was good or bad.
The first 2200 millennium pairs of built-in veporizers were used to select this product, but the battery ran out in 200 degrees, 5 minutes and 3 sessions.
The second USB terminal is poor.
It is not rechargeable.
This product was a product to solve the problem until now, but when I re-entered the battery about 15 times (I used the battery in the charger so that the USB terminal did not break) the contact became worse or the power supply became difficult.
When the lid is pressed, the power is turned on.
If you are an Aikos user, you may have experience.
That's the symptoms.
As noted in the notebook, batteries are not used for batteries other than attachments.
The nails and catches are like shavings, so it seems that there are no bends.
As a result, it was returned in about 10 days.
At the same time as the return, I bought no Staley logo, but I compared it to this one.
It looks the same in size.
The chamber and draw are the same.
LCD This is beautiful.
It may be newer than the logo.
Vibration This is a refrain.
It's like a smartphone vibe.
No logo is the vibration of the vibe or the sound.
It is a cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is china too.
Attachments are slightly different.
This is the case with Liquid.
The logo is solidified like steel wool.
It's like that.
I think Staley would have been nicer, but if it breaks down quickly, it's going to lose credit.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose a return, so it was troublesome, but I proceeded with the procedure.
The ear rubber, the ear rubber.
This flat rubber is not really painful.
It is the best mask of the same type that I have used to date.
Even in plain rubber, it can be twisted, the part of the twisted heli is rubbed into the root of the ear, and it hurts more than the round rubber.
The three-dimensional fit to the face not only fits, but also has a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower part of the ago, so it is difficult to feel the pain.
It is because it fits the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it suits everyone the same, but I think it's better to try it once if you think it's other small sizes and all of them are yummy.
When I opened the outer box, it was in the central slit vinyl, like a box tissue, but when I took out the first one, the ear rubber on both sides was scratched and it was hard to get it out, so I reduced one star.
The company's response is star one.
Although the price and taste are inexplicable, I was distrustful of the response of the vendors who ignored and sent it, even though it was designated by day.
Other than this product, I bought a drink together.
I always buy at amazon, so I'm also familiar with the delivery staff.
In particular, we took care of the arrival date as much as possible to bring heavy things up to the top, but it is not.
Because of amazon, it is difficult for transportation companies, but I think there is one thing that can be cooperated with the user side.
I am disappointed by the response of arrogant contractors.
But the price is cheap.
If you're going to buy, you're going to have to pay for it.
I don't think it can be used for a long time because there are so many complaints.
I think it is better to consider it at the expense of disposing.
For reference, it seems that some municipalities have centers that accept free, cheap and rough garbage if brought in.
[Setting comfort] The seating surface is slightly tilted to the left and graphed further, so I am very tired of sitting.
If you move a little bit, you will get loud noise.
You can't use it at night.
I feel that this is the biggest problem and I can't continue to use it.
[Assembling] The assembly manual is only an explanation in a rough picture.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many misrepresentations.
There is no explanation for the orientation of the seating and the mounting of the pillar fixing station.
When installed correctly, the height adjustment lever is backwards on the right side and the dial adjusts the direction of the spring on the back.
However, the height adjustment lever is more natural than the front, so many people will install it incorrectly.
In the instructions, there are no such basic precautions, and it will be assembled while trying and erroring while looking at a cluttered picture.
There is an error in the description of the contents The list of contents at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who are looking for 8x20mm screws that come with 12 attached.
8x20mm screws have already been inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to look for waste.
There seems to be a combination that is low in machine accuracy and cannot be inserted with the same screw holes and screws.
In some combinations, it is very difficult to simply insert screws into screw holes.
Therefore, it can be imagined that the screw is shipped in this way.
He also found no spare screws in the instructions.
[Other] The black part of the surface of vinyl leather is colored and it looks white, so it is better not to expect beautiful things like product photos.
An explanation of the inadequacy of the instructions and a supplementary explanation of the above installation method were received from the e-mail address registered to amazon on 2-3 days after the product arrived.
It should be immediately after shipment of goods.
In the two to three days from the arrival of the product, many purchasers have completed assembly, so it is completely meaningless.
Um...
A big fan of Thermos, I have been using thermos straw type for more than 15 years.
1 Straw's drinking mouth parts have become harder material than ever before, and the groove is cut into the body, so you can no longer get the mouth parts of straw from the body!
I'm desperately trying to break my nails.
Only the tip of the mouth of the straw is thinner than ever, and the strawbrush is no longer available.
The mysterious part of the valve attached to the top of the straw is thicker than the strawbrush and is dramatically harder to wash.
It's a bit of a shock because I haven't had any complaints about using straw types until now.
It is really stressful not to be able to drink from the body.
The good point is the outstanding refrigeration power as always.
When I forgot to leave the bag and wash it the next day, the ice I put in the day before still remains about 50%.
I don't drink hot, so I'm a straw type.
Thank you for your improvement in the next model.
The first review (with additional photos)
We will review it for the first time.
(It was the first time I bought a doll, and the impression of the amateurs who had little knowledge of wearing a doll eye for the first time) We received the product as shown in the photo.
When I put it on the Obituary d'Or, it was very cute and light.
However, it is not possible to wear it if the entrance is slightly rigid and pressed.
I think the way I did it was different, but I put a tweezer in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About Shipping Since it was the first time to ship from outside Japan, I had set a three-week schedule, but I arrived eight days earlier than I thought (Narita Airport is close).
I was worried because I had never sent a shipping email.
If you look at the description of Amazon shipping earlier, it is still being shipped.
There was no damage and no air in the eyes, and there was a lot of petite in the back of the envelope, so I think it is safe.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information okay even though it is an email from outside Japan?
I wondered, so I will make it minus 1.
I think it's a great bargain if this amount is at that price without any problems.
Addition Dolleye 8mm model iPhonese
It's a little bit smaller (a narrower working area), it's less charged
I ordered the size notation after watching it, but it felt twice smaller than I had imagined.
Although it is larger than the A4 size, the outer circumference is grooved for part stock, so the range for work is narrower than the A4.
I tried to use it when repairing electronic equipment or creating a gampla, but it is difficult to use without the B4 size.
Other work, such as assembly and disassembly, can be done if another tray mat is used.
Within the area of magazine size, it is impossible to put tools, put parts, and do more work...
I thought about ordering the same thing to double the area, but I think it would be tough to keep using it because it is too hard to charge while working, and all parts that have been cut off are sucked.
Deadly defects
After the lid of the battery box was not opened and the lid was finally opened using a rubber anti-slip sheet, but if you try to load the battery and close it, it will not be closed.
It's out at this point.
Highly regarded!
Will the battery box lid close???
To add, a small salan wrap was attached to the product instead of the protective seal.
This is, however, second-hand??
Speaking of explanations, only a small piece of English is written.
Everyone knows how to operate without explanation of the figure.
Maybe it's good for other fingers...
I found a good product!
I bought it immediately.
I use it for pinky rings, so if I don't use it a lot, I don't fit in.
But I think it's good for other fingers.
But I think it's a good idea merchant.
At a price
You should not ask for the quality of this product.
One flower mark was shattered.
The feeling of putting it on is just fine in size.
Although those with thick ears may be harsh.
What if I could have bought it?
Yabana
The design is good, but when you get it, it's big.
East of the road during the winter.
As in other reviews, the electric wire is only 110×80, and the position is not vertical but horizontal.
I bought it because I wanted to warm up the entire futon, but I bought it because it was bigger, but I can't check it at the store like a famous manufacturer.
It can only be used in combination with the N-warm of hot water and tori.
By the way, the quality of blankets is outright.
It's good.
It is small and has enough wind.
Batteries can also be replaced with spares.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it will look good if it looks like a picture.
On Tsurutsuru's desk, I blow up with my own wind power, but if I put a handkerchief on it, it would be fine.
The sound is not noticed even in the "medium" if it is used outside / family, but even "small" in the office is not possible.
It is necessary to divide it as a service at the time of going out.
In addition, even though it is "small" for office users, the wind volume is too low and it is too cold.
It's perfect for a scene where you get sweaty and run away to Families and cool down at once at "big."
However, when a bag is released, the power button is pressed and it can be turned around without knowing.
It would be nice if you have ingenuity such as pulling a button slightly (falling) or holding down the first push.
It is an essential item in an era of raging heat that is dangerous to life, so it will help you make something better.
Multifunctional light speakers
It is used in the bedroom as the weakest warm color color.
It's better than I thought!
It was good to buy it.
As a light, you can adjust the light and color by touch.
The white color suits any room, and the color light changes with gradation, so it is beautiful.
Also, if you touch the color you like, it will stop in your favorite color, so you can light it up to your mood!
Because it is LED type, you can expect a long life.
When it comes to sound quality, I think it is a level that is satisfying enough for my ears, who are amateurs.
The great thing about this light is that it's multifunctional anyway.
At the top is a large speaker.
You can pair Bluetooth with your phone, etc., so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
Hands-free calls can also be made if paired with your phone.
It also supports MicroSD, so you can play music as an mp3 player.
Introduction and piano practice
At the age of 66, he started challenging DTM to prevent bokeh.
Buy the audio interface and the booklet.
At the beginning, I was playing piano, and I'm practising every day.
I downloaded the sound source, but the protection did not work, and I downloaded ASIO at first, but I use this for piano practice because the free piano sound source is good.
I think it was nice to buy it.
I feel deceived by the look.
Is it a product that's gone?
It will be a long sentence.
The synthetic leather of the doushisha office chair (bumped armrest) used for four to five years deteriorated and became shattered, so I considered buying it in a chair with a non-synthetic leather armrest.
It has a home and furniture store, but there is no suitable one.
Although there is anxiety about not being able to check the actual product, it compromises the appearance and price of the design and buys this product at Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is only one spare screw.
[Note] The attached hexagon wrench and screws are oiled and betobeto.
At first, the hexagonal wrench did not know the adhesion of oil, so the body was white, so when the oil was added, it burned.
The assembly was completed in 40 minutes.
Finished product confirmation.
The armrests on the left and right sides have different stiffness, the left side is heavy, the right is light, the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak, and it drips quickly along with the sound.
The seat has a non-regenerated high density urethane foam that feels hard and not comfortable to sit down (weak elasticity?
The mesh on the back part is stiffer than the other company's mesh chair, and if it is thin, the back hurts.
In detail, the height from the seat to the ground was 530, not 550 (the height of the seat is important for high height).
A separate cushion is laid, and the part of the mesh fabric is used with a towelket because the deterioration (scarring) seems to come quickly.
At 186cm80kg, I felt good about the fit of the back, but I think it is a product that is not satisfied other than that, and I feel that it is a product that has a bump.
After all, it might be better to sit down and buy an office chair.
Do you contact us about armrests and headrests?
We're considering it.
Well, what is this?
I bought a 4K tuner for Pixela, which was pricey without much expectation, because the environment of the poor house, apparently the right turn BS4K seems to be seen.
As an experiment, you can see free broadcasts of NHK BS4K and other right swirls, and at the same time, you can watch beautifully on Panasonic's 4K TV.
(Occasionally the image is incredulous) As the update came immediately after purchase and it was recorded, I have made some reservation recordings.
The user interface is also not praised, but it is divided into "seen 4K broadcasting."
By the way, it seems that you can only play the chase of the recording program during reservation recording, and I accept it as a plus function that can be recorded on HDD in 4K.
Excessive expectations are prohibitive, as you may be disappointed if you expect a lot of things.
We expect it to improve with updates.
The temperature retention function is okay.
I've only used the temperature protection function yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles, it warmed up in about two hours and it felt hot in two and a half hours.
It was installed on the foot of the passenger seat of the compact car and used, but the fan sound is careful when idling stops, but I do not feel at all while running.
I was worried about the smell of chemicals that are still new or fan-emitting. I needed ventilation to open the window regularly.
As another person wrote in the review, the Bali of the part through the shoulder cord is harsh, so you need to break the Bali by minus driver etc.
It's really fragile.
Today, it suddenly broke in two months after I started using it.
I liked the pitch key and the size, but it didn't make sense to break.
I use a PC all day for the job of processing video, but the volume is 100%.
Even if it is lowered, it will return to 100% in a moment.
The earbuds have a sore ear and can't be used, and it's a sound that can be used at night.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds, and the volume display is repeated on the PC screen or disappear.
Furthermore, the keyboard interrupts the mouse instruction, so you can not use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard.
Enter and backspace keys are no longer reacting.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's a thousand yen, you can buy it for a try.
If you're lucky, you'll be able to use it for half a year.
This is a six-month warranty compared to a one-year to three-year warranty.
The shortness of the warranty period tells the fragile.
Goods are best, packing is the worst
I love the product because it is different in color and it is my favorite.
If you're looking for food stockers, we recommend it!
However, there were so many gaps that it rolled into a large piece of cardboard, and there was no delivery book, so packing was the worst.
The lid was also off when I opened the box.
The product is recommended, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the intensity, but for now
When I bought the lid, I bought it because the support was gone.
It plays a role in terms of the stability of the lid, but it is a nice plastic product, so if you do not pay attention to it when opening or closing the lid, it will make a disgusting sound, "Mekimeki, (break).
You have to choose something that suits the thickness of the lid, so be careful when buying.
The meatballs are cute back.
When I was looking for a back to go out with a dog, I was attracted to the gray fashionable back and bought it.
It was made of a built-in formula, and when I took it, it was surprisingly light, so it felt not so heavy even if I had it.
The fastener also moves smoothly and there is no such thing as scratching.
It seems easy to travel for a long time.
It is also very compact and easy to fold.
Even if it is folded, you can see the design of the meatball and it is cute even if you put it.
Light and comfortable!
The slippers are comfortable to use.
First of all, I bought it at a glance at the appearance and cheapness of the price!
TSA Rock is a favorite of Coco for a few years, but it is convenient.
And number locking is recommended as a master of key forgetting or loss.
However, if I ask for toughness or security, the fastener is a cloth for a week, so it is pissed with a knife!
In addition, I want to be able to overlap because the fastener is sweet.
If you are overseas, it is recommended to bring it on board.
For now, I used it for a Shinkansen trip, but it was comfortable.
It's hard to choose a size...
It is hard to buy shoes because of its wide range.
Converses and bangs wear 24cm.
MRL996 is also 24 cm.
At first, I thought it was tight, but when I got used to it, I was fine.
This time, the ML574 was certainly tight if my sister told me that it was 24.5 cm tight.
It was like a small finger hit.
So I bought 25 cm.
When I reach and open it, it's big...
When I put it on, it was a bit loose even though I was wearing socks.
I wondered if I was going to return it, but if it became tight at 24.5, it would be troublesome, so I would like to put it inside at 25.
I bought a team red but it's so good with a bright red!
There are a lot of black and white monotone outfits, so if you wear this, it will be brighter!
165cm, men in their 40s
We ordered L size as appropriate, but if you are similar to the spec below, we recommend M size.
Height: 165 centimeters Weight: 60 kilos West: 81 centimeters Around it: 100 centimeters Typical metabolic belly.
In the water, the rush guard comes up because the waist part is loose.
I am swimming while fixing the raised part.
Especially when you're juggling and oily, the metabolic belly looks round.
In addition, if you walk while exercising violently, you will get up from below.
<Make of products> The fabric is too tough and thin, so there is no worry about the nipples clearing.
At this price, I can be satisfied with this creation, but I think it is better to buy small.
Gas leaks.
The silver colt 25 also had a gas leak, but once the valve was replaced, the tank part was missing, so I was able to close the tank tightly and grease it up, so I was able to beat it comfortably.
188 yen, i thought what quality
It can be used as early as possible and when torque is needed.
It is light, small, and simplicity without decoration.
I didn't have any time to install bits, and I thought this was an amazing kospa if it was 188 yen.
What about durability?
It may not be so often used, but I think it can be put in a toolbox.
I bought it with a familiar distributor, "1/4" hexagonal shank magnetic quick release driver rollet bit holder 60/100/150 mm."
It was pretty good instead of the price.
The controller is gone.
It is not possible to operate on its own.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but as soon as a few minutes, it becomes a symptom that the self-propelled machine can move in a different direction and cannot be operated.
It is better not to buy this product.
I will be alert to everyone.
It's a terrible product.
It is wired, but it is recommended for the controller of the BEVONCOOL PS3.
It is reliable and has been used for a long time, but it has not yet been broken.
It can also be used for PC games.
Note I was able to refund an Amazon gift certificate after returning it as a bad product within a month, so I think it was good.
So you're going to get the computational power?
I think it is a child-oriented person who understands calculations.
Isn't it impossible to be a child who can understand calculations to some extent?
It is difficult to solve the problem.
Also, when I give my parents the tools, I give them something on my fingers.
In short, it may be easy for people who are familiar with DS to alleviate?
I don't like illustrations of cartoon characters, or I think DS can come in from the interestingness of the screen...
The method of calculating is also a method of competing for time, for example, how to answer questions in a few minutes.
I understand how you feel about rushing through tests and so on, but... don't you get scorched and calculated?
I don't like why gongs sound when it's over.
Isn't it OK to make it sound more comfortable even though you're doing it hard?
I feel like 6,200 yen has lost some money.
You can see the price of this half.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
After all, the persona song is nice!
Persona 3 reaches ED.
5 played until the middle.
Persona 4 is trocon in vita.
What I can do is not changed from my previous persona 4.
I probably don't have a story, but it feels shorter than the previous one.
The song is cool after all!
I feel like I'm just listening!
The character of Persona 3 was the first HD, so I was impressed when I first saw it.
Somehow Junpei looked beautiful (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the original, so there is no freshness...
As a sound game, it felt easier to play than 3 to 5.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was hard to see when the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even with the background.
Because it has abundant assist function, I think you can play even if you are not good at sound game.
If you turn on the challenge feature, it may be a teething game.
The triple pack has a Santra, but it's a solid four-piece set rather than an omelet, so if you like the persona song, we recommend it here.
I'm sorry.
I liked the color of the dial in the photo and bought it, but the real thing is blue, but it is close to black or chakor grey.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but I'm on hold for now.
Notes After the review was published, we received an email from the dealer stating that we apologize and exchange new products.
The process was quick after that.
I think the response was very good despite the cheap products.
4 stars in response, plus gold.
The color is almost as beautiful as the picture.
But after all, the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the description photo is clear.
It's only a shame there.
The evening becomes very heavy.
I used it for SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setting, I got to Korea and didn't know how to do it after pointing to the SIM, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Kimura Airport to tell me (set up> Mobile Communication> Turn on data roaming from the communication option), and it was well done.
It seems that the editorial attached to the product did not matter much...?
However, the area around Kinpo Airport was in a bad condition, so I was always grabbing 3G.
It became 4G when I got out of the city.
In the evenings and nights, the communication became very heavy, but if you think about it now, you might have reached a maximum of hundreds of MB a day.
Better than i thought.
I used SoftBank Z4 for two years, sim-free and Ymobile, and the Z4 was getting worse.
I used mobile Suica, so I was worried about whether I could use it properly, but I had no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so I was impressed with the iPhone 6?
GAME does not work, so the speed of processing is not the same as the Z4, so I think it is a little faster.
It looked like an iPhone, and I thought it was amazing. I also made Android Ver9 and I was able to shop satisfactory.
What I care about. It's a little bit smaller. There's no straphole. *Supported in a case with a strap hole. I'm not experimenting with water resistance. It's a little heavy. I'm still using a little bit, but I'm happy.
