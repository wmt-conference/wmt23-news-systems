Diego Cocca becomes the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not among the favorites for the position until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused anger within the club.
Geesthacht: New flower bed signs encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up plant signs in the flower beds of the pedestrian zone.
The campaign "Geesthacht in bloom" also includes information about what is currently blooming - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht in Bloom" is an initiative by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, daycare centers, companies, and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted since 2015. The goal: to create extensive flowering islands in the Geesthacht urban area where insects can find food at any time. "With favorable weather conditions, bees already fly out in January to search for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has beehives on his property.
To ensure that the project is not just an initiative of conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also extends into private gardens, explanatory panels about the plants are regularly provided. About 50 signs have been placed so far. Passers-by can thus inform themselves about what is currently blooming so beautifully. The hope is that hobby gardeners will deliberately plant these at home.
In the first week of January, the Wildhasel season had already started
More recent additions to the pedestrian zone's flower beds include shrubs such as winter fragrant cherry laurel and winter snowball. They have been planted in the containers along Bergedorfer Street for a year now, showing their first delicate white and pink blossoms without leaves, and have recently been provided with additional signs. "The winter fragrant cherry laurel is a very wide bush and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," can be read there, along with other information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bed plants are now showing flowers. The wild hazel season started in the first week of January. It blooms particularly lushly on Richtweg near the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg, and many hedgerows.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich - Dance legend Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them if he looked down from heaven to Munich's East Train Station!
Every Monday, three ladies meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at exactly 3 pm for a lively tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, or rather young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native Munich woman (born January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap dancing is my life, I can't imagine it without them."
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also hit the dance floor.
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would say a musical actress, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life dancing, acting, and singing."
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the youngest in the group of tap dancers. She says, "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl."
Wikipedia: Tap dance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is onomatopoeically Tap dance and the French Claquettes. The Spanish Flamenco may have influenced tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the heart and soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer, and choreographer. "We are a big family, and everyone is welcome here, young and old, big and small."
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, healthy eating, and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
With the advancement of digitalization, some people are rediscovering their passion for analog
The rapid pace at which our everyday life has become digital has left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and adapting our communication and work methods accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. In 1985, if you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen, there were three options. Either you were one of the lucky six percent who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a call to relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a phone booth. The unforgettable smell of the plastic handset and the clicking of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the face of the other person while calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also known as Moldavia), President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisors.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself explained as the reason for her resignation - apparently, she was being attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice."
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent, and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu holds a comfortable majority, as it occupies 63 out of 101 seats. Therefore, the confirmation of the new Prime Minister and his cabinet should not pose any problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, there will be a big celebration in Veitshöchheim again. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't take long to join in.
State leader Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume might suggest. He sees himself more as the tribal elder of Bavaria. By his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children's hero Chase from Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franconia came Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja.
Completely off the ground: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn to outer space.
State Parliament President Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as the inspiration for her costume.
In Peace-and-Love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, also known as Building Minister Christian Bernreiter, with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's Golden Boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff during carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. By his side, his wife Gerswid.
On tour: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, follows suit.
The political opposition, of course, could not be missing.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party parliamentary group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian Lion.
Hiking is the passion of the SPD parliamentary group leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres.
It got royal at FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the move as a mime. By his side, his wife Andrea.
If politics doesn't work out, he can always turn to magic. Nuremberg's Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Fast as a bee on the move: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth, and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small jab at climate activists from Franconian crime scene investigator Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The First Mayor of Veitshöchheim, Jürgen Götz, and his wife Julia were, of course, also present.
Oberhof: Kühn finishes eighth in the World Championship Sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and is closing in on his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on-site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partly strong fog did not prevent the perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold at Rennsteig. On Wednesday, he had already successfully defended his title with Norway's mixed relay team.
Hardly anyone doubts that in the hunting race number three will follow. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, allowing him to compensate for shooting errors up to a certain extent with frightening ease.
Meanwhile, things were not going well for Doll. After the veteran missed out on a medal opportunity in the mixed relay due to a penalty lap and only managed to secure sixth place, things did not improve three days later. Three penalty laps in the prone shooting and two more standing were a huge disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago with a razor-thin 0.7 seconds lead ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career victories for Doll, who has been on the podium once this winter. The Olympic eighth-place finisher from Beijing left wordlessly after his weak performance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees finished in 19th place, while the second World Championship debutant David Zobel ranked 35th.
Biden welcomes Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the main focus is on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden emphasized the preservation of democratic values during a visit from his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"Our strong democracy in both of our nations has been tested," Biden said on Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula responded, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolated for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had won against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. On January 1st, Lula took office. The transfer of power was accompanied by severe riots. Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered the Parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not care much about international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon, and evening," said Lula. "Sounds familiar," replied Biden - an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? They showed the members of the Red Army Faction who were released for denunciation and shooting.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was stirred up against the most dangerous opponents of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say of bourgeois democracy, let's say of late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the truly dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now, the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which usually focuses on troublemakers in the S-Bahn or exhibitionists in the park, has released a new edition featuring the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so interesting, there is a photo gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, as there may be more "Russian friends" in this world, including Asia, Africa, and Latin America, than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, instead: In positions 1 to 5 (!) is Ms. Wagenknecht, followed by Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who still reads this paper. If there is, it's high time now. We have reached the well-known level where there is nothing below it.
And by now, at the latest, in good dialectical fashion, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician among all those who are not yet completely stupefied, i.e., peace-loving, pacifist, and anti-militarist people. (And no further differentiation is necessary here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It says: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for the dissolution of his civil partnership through his family lawyer at the responsible court. I will not comment on details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, with separation rumors circulating for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marriage problems on the RTL show.
SS Massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last Survivor Dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins were preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. France's President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, said Macron. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. The survivor was involved in Franco-German youth encounters, among other things.
A curved layout for 14 houses: In Homeien, everyone knows everyone
LZ-Series Northern Lippe Hamlets: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, residents find pure idyll. In summer, up to 300 motorcycles per day sometimes roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even go straight back.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against high inflation rates to be "absolutely" necessary. "The inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs can easily rise again, and the opening of China can temporarily boost prices," Sewing told "Welt am Sonntag."
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive time in early February and indicated a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The prime rate in the euro area is now at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate, which commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB, is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher loan interest rates can lead to postponed investments and thus weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted eurozone countries like Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more severe than higher financing costs for some countries," said Sewing. "Of course, we must keep an eye on this, but high levels of debt should not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB aims for medium-term price stability in the euro area with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been far off for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, but consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent above the level of the previous year's month.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, as they can afford less for one euro. Significantly increased energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also President of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the greatest danger to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany-Tempo" for infrastructure projects announced by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue about it. And it might be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end, a set of rules will emerge that doesn't necessarily have to be as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The goal was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas deliveries. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new "Germany pace" on the occasion. In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval processes for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, this should not automatically mean that we always act so categorically from now on and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against their will," said Hartung. There must therefore still be a negotiation process to determine what we as a society consider right and wrong.
In the past, they tried using the classic set of rules and didn't succeed. "We should reconsider whether our previous approach was really correct. Maybe we went overboard with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves."
Considering the many open tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. "As a consumer of this energy, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns against the breakup of the Bayer Group
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a potential breakup of the Bayer corporation following an announced leadership change. "From the perspective of the employees, Bayer is perfectly positioned with its three pillars to face the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board, in the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
The reference is to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health sector with over-the-counter medications, and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - not on hedge fund activism."
The background is the announced change of leadership at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical company on Thursday. The controversial CEO Werner Baumann will step down from his position this summer. Bill Anderson, the former pharmaceutical head of Swiss rival Roche, is set to take over in early June.
Baumann has long been under criticism. The 2018 acquisition of US seed producer Monsanto for $63 billion continues to haunt the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into their house. The Bayer stock has been in decline for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to relieve the CEO at the annual general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann does not intend to extend his contract, which was originally supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had been putting pressure on him. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, such as Bluebell Capital, have also been involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a breakup of the corporation.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. "A spin-off of the Consumer Health division could be a possible way to increase the company's value," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, in an interview with the "Rheinische Post". However, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop Science agricultural division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to protest against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French also plan to take to the streets again to protest the proposed pension reform.
Trade unions are opposing a government project with massive street protests. Hundreds of thousands are expected to demonstrate against pension reform again on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to take to the streets again on Saturday to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, unions are mobilizing against the government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. Twice already, over a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted at protests. A turbulent debate has been taking place in parliament for a week over the controversial reform.
Already, many people in France work longer than the age of 62 if they have not contributed long enough for a full pension when they reach the retirement age. Opponents of the reform argue that people in many demanding jobs can hardly work any longer. Moreover, employees want to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not completely wear out their health in their job.
Macron: Looming Deficit in Pension Fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. As the population gets older, employees must cover an increasing number of retirees with their contributions. In order to maintain the level of pensions, the population must work a little more. Critics question the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
However, the government does not only want to adjust the retirement age. The already decided increase in the necessary contribution period for a full pension is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is expected to rise to around 1200 Euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, an initial attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, with massive protests and strikes already taking place at that time. Several presidents before Macron have tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - widespread protests and strikes were a certainty for all of them.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, they hope to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced their support. However, some of the deputies - even from Macron's faction - still have reservations. And currently, Macron's concern about crippling strikes may be greater than the fear of a close vote. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility to ensure that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sunshine at high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure system is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that we can expect a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high-pressure area shifts a little to the east during the course of next week, it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and bring people in the lowlands days of dreary high fog gray, while there is pure sunshine in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges."
The Sunday starts foggy and overcast in most regions. According to DWD, there may still be some rain from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. The cloud cover will loosen up mainly at the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west during the day, and the sun will appear more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or covered with high fog. Temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
"On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble at the high fog and dissolve it more and more throughout the day," says the meteorologist. All-day sunshine is expected at the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges, and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, while elsewhere it has to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum temperatures are between 5 and 9 degrees, around 11 degrees at the Lower Rhine, but only around 3 degrees are expected in the persistent gray in the southeast. A weak wind blows from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some low-lying areas, there may be slow dissipation of fog or high fog again. Otherwise, the weather will be sunny after the fog clears. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW, and at the edge of the Alps, the sun is expected to shine all day long. Temperatures will climb to 5 to 11 degrees Celsius, depending on the sunshine.
Dominatrix struggles: Still no World Championship medal for Goggia
The heavily favored Sofia Goggia expressed great disappointment after her elimination in the downhill race at the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
"I am sad because I did not perform as well as I know I can," said the Italian woman on ZDF, after she had missed a gate and was eliminated. At least the 30-year-old was able to prevent a potentially serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six season races in this discipline so far. After winning gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, known for her risky racing style, will have to continue waiting for a World Championship medal in her signature discipline. She missed her home race in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in good shape. It was about hundredths of a second," said Goggia after the surprising victory of Swiss Jasmine Flury in French Méribel. "I'm disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal that all experts expected and ultimately missed: "But they're not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Since February 10th, Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for information about her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the release of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the public for assistance in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on February 10, 2023, around 12:30 pm. She was last seen at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has only very limited German language and local knowledge.

Zelensky and ministers oppose Russia's Olympic participation
Kyiv. With the demand to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed in a joint teleconference to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, according to the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of the United Kingdom. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. "And I made the UK's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this matter."
Previously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions during an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," said Zelensky. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Due to the Russian offensive war, ultimately even a neutral flag is soaked in blood and not bearable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also views Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides military bases for Russian troop attacks. Selenskyj called on officials to stand up for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty."
The conference was prompted by the IOC's announcement that it intends to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening to boycott if the IOC permits the athletes to compete.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had also reaffirmed during the consultations its rejection of Russian and Belarusian athletes participating in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports back to the competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the unrestricted solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong approach," a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior told dpa upon request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sports should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, insists that sports and politics must be kept separate.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for the return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently stated that exclusion "due to a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.
Chalk it up where it happens
"Hey, nice butt!", whistling at the jester in a skimpy sexy costume and shouting suggestive phrases: All of this falls under the term "catcalling" (German: Katzenrufe). Behind the term lies nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? : USA sees Moscow's tank inventory significantly reduced
Half of the vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank inventory significantly reduced
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. They are talking about "half of the main stock."
The Russian army has lost an estimated half of its battle tanks in its war against Ukraine, according to the US Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated" by Ukraine, said Celeste Wallander, Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs in the US Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates during an online event hosted by the think tank Center for a New American Security.
In the coming weeks, Ukraine is set to receive battle tanks from several Western allies. The United Kingdom has promised Kyiv the delivery of Challenger-2 battle tanks in March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The United States has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks, although their delivery is expected to take significantly longer.
Russia Wants to Step Up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev announced the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for planes, missiles, and tanks," said Medvedev, who is now Deputy Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case, it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows for a stronger focus of the economy on the needs of the army. This means that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Controversy over army position appointments
Because the position, which will be held in the future by the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The personnel representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption in office and abuse of authority. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is for a previously vacant position, according to the minister. She does not want to comment on the "speculations of a liberal personnel representative." Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he faced serious allegations of bullying. These have been resolved from Tanner's point of view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on World War I and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process." The decision has the "appearance of cronyism," says SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos call on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still neck-deep in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary inquiry on the subject.
Carnival: First fools buckle under costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to maintain the traditional carnival parade, unlike the state capital. However, the higher costs, including for security, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone make up about half of the calculated total costs for the parade.
No carnival parades are canceled in Brandenburg. The "Zug der fröhlichen Leute" (Parade of Happy People) in Cottbus, probably once again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades have been canceled for the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht either.
Despite increased costs, Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne remains committed to the traditional parade. "We are going through with our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. However, financial worries are also pressing here: if more sponsors are not found or the existing ones do not contribute more, reserves will have to be tapped - "this cannot happen every year." The current deficit: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: In the case of confectionery, there is a price increase of up to 60 percent in some cases, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Parade Support Association. Fortunately, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that the parade will be more expensive. Twice as much staff will be needed for security as in 2020.
Those standing along the parade route at the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland might receive fewer candies than before. Due to the increased cost of sweets, some parade participants may not have as much to give out. Regardless of the amount of candy, visitor turnout is expected to be high: "I believe that if it doesn't rain heavily on that day, we can definitely expect an increased number of people," says Cologne parade leader Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Rosenmontagszug for two years. The parade is, of course, irreplaceable."
The Cologne festival committee does not comment on costs in detail. However, the parade is generally "deficit-ridden," which is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
Ukrainians are not considered to be heavy drinkers for no reason. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then, I discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't taste much difference. The same applies to vodka, which is widespread. They mainly distill it themselves in the villages. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much is consumed in the former Soviet republics. A few years ago, the Russian Health Minister claimed that consumption had dropped by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with it. But this only applies if it goes into mass sales. There is probably some adulteration going on.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and Drink
Those looking to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or enjoy a beer after work will find great spots in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work gatherings or pre-gaming for club parties. Where is the best place? A look at the Google reviews will show it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President witnesses favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal distribution at the Oberhof World Championship sprint. However, there were two bright spots in the fog.
As much as the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the grandstand on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to get the results on my cell phone," admitted Frank-Walter Steinmeier with a smile, referring to the fog that kept rolling into the stadium, severely impairing the view at Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier still enjoyed the visit to the 10-km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, receiving numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is fantastic and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say the same - with thanks to those who have been involved since the World Championships were awarded here." In terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "secure for the next years and even decades."
Once again, Norwegian athlete Johannes Thingnes Bö outpaced the competition in a sporting event. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his error-free shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds behind) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the perfect Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters could not compete for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished in eighth place as the best German after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. In contrast, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed performance on Wednesday, the Black Forest native left five discs standing this time and disappeared as the 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment, into the locker room.
Bö started the race with the number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and maintained this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, he had the luck of the skilled with his last two standing shots; they each landed on the edge of the targets and still fell. The 29-year-old enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-older brother: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In contrast, the German hopes for the women rest on Herrmann-Wick. "When you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as the tenth. It's all about full throttle and attack to defend the number one," said Sports Director Felix Bitterling, putting his "locomotive" to the test. The organizers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 pm and 3:30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the field
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on a dropped ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently penalize" unsportsmanlike behavior. Referee chief Fröhlich points out a role model function.
German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the interaction on the field. "I do think that there are new behaviors of the players who surround the referee like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to this - and will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches were also given dismissals. Mainz coach Bo Svensson received a red card during the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Freiburg's coach Christian Streich was given a yellow-red card in the league defeat in Dortmund. "The behavior of the coaches also falls under the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has increased in this area, and that the behavior towards us referees has become somewhat more demanding or aggressive. We want to consistently penalize such unsportsmanlike conduct," said Brych.
DFB Referee Chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a generally good relationship between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship is good. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned has to live with that. It shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotions can certainly lead to conflicts during the course of a game. But when emotions spill over into personal insults, one must also accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have resolved the issues afterwards. "What would be important is if a change in thinking overall would take place, that such behavior is simply not acceptable," said Fröhlich at an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on other levels. "Of course, incidents from professional football always have an impact. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, referees have consistently reacted to negative behavior," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured by Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race, ahead of the overall leader from Austria, Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia finished third.
The German combined skiers will not compete in the Black Forest with their best lineup. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel, and Johannes Rydzek are not participating. They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team naturally feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven minor injuries after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people were injured, including two children, in an accident involving four vehicles on Highway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis). According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a driver hit a car from behind during a slight traffic jam and pushed it into two other vehicles. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
The initiators of the exhibition, Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right), stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12th, an unusual exhibition comes to an end at the Marler Sculpture Museum. There will be some extras for the finale.
The closing event for the exhibition "Wall-bound" will take place on Sunday, February 12th, at 3 pm in the temporary quarters of the Marler Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings each attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over, and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalog documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12th by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the closing event, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. Using numerous visual examples, she will present the unique features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and explore the connections to this art form in the Federal Republic, focusing on North Rhine-Westphalia in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who completed her doctorate on the mural painting of the Weimar Republic in 2013. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in construction in NRW. After the lecture, the final curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be present.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It concerns construction defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued for 33 people, reported the state news agency Anadolu on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are believed to be responsible for construction defects that may have contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The Adana prosecutor's office is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. As part of this investigation, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far. One of the suspects was reportedly arrested at Istanbul airport. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another 7.6 magnitude earthquake at noon. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has passed away
Hans Modrow has passed away, as announced by the Left Party faction in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died in the night to Saturday. Faction leader Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party thus loses "a significant personality," explained faction leader Dietmar Bartsch and former faction leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the District Leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on November 13, 1989, he was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded by CDU politician Lothar de Maizière as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until reunification.
The parliamentary group leader of the Left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Until his old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful process of the creation of German unity was precisely one of his special achievements. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It continues:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament, and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After the reunification, Modrow served in the German Bundestag for the PDS from 1990 to 1994 and represented them in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state "quite critically." The German unity was accomplished too quickly, the GDR had disappeared too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened during the night
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kyiv must carry out emergency repairs on the power grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs on the Ukrainian power grid. However, Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, said the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Chmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant, and production was reduced at the Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack involving around 100 missiles and cruise missiles on Friday as terror. In a video message, he reported to his fellow citizens about the significant support Ukraine received during his trip to London, Paris, and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24th, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. The danger from Russian missile attacks continued into the night on Saturday. In the capital Kyiv, an air raid alarm was triggered for the fifth time on Friday evening. "A drone attack is imminent," the military administration of the Kyiv region reported. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
German Railways: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens during the election campaign to separate these failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, they agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate and distribute profits.
Backlog of 80 billion euros in renovation
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government in overseeing this process. The backlog of maintenance on the rail network is a major reason why the trains are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has made it his mission to eliminate this problem by completely renovating entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. However, according to more recent calculations by the railway, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances apparently did not speak in favor of Herrmann-Wick. She had slept poorly, she said after the race, was "totally excited", and her pulse did not come down even during the warm-up. "Such a race", and that at the home World Championships, "cannot be described in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, coaches and team embraced each other.
"Enjoy biathlon," that's what she had planned
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championship as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope outside of the relay teams. Herrmann-Wick has won two World Cups this winter as the only German. She is currently ranked fifth in the overall World Cup standings. And even though the performance density among women at the top is significantly higher than among men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, other contenders were expected for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. At that time, protesters demanding Ortega's resignation found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting his overthrow together with the US government.
German Armed Forces: Defense industry demands more orders from special funds
First armament projects have already been canceled, and further plans are at risk, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag." However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be specifically affected. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible savings requirement at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a request from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background of the decreasing investment amount is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special assets, which the Bundestag decided on in June 2022, must bear the interest burden for the loans themselves. As these increase, there is less money available for the actual purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the currently high inflation is causing the purchasing power of the remaining amount to decrease.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 Injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01:40 am, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from Kupferzell, wanted to turn left onto the highway towards Heilbronn at the Kupferzell motorway entrance. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving on the B 19 towards Künzelsau, as the police reported. During the turning process of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no complaints. Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old, and the passenger in the BMW were all slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The total damage to both cars amounted to approximately 20,000 euros.
Castle Square Stuttgart commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many people from Stuttgart followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria concerns the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered at Stuttgart's Schlossplatz to remember the victims and pray for them.
Many community members had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's prayer earnestly and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could overcome this disaster. He asked for health, protection from plagues, and respectful interaction with each other. The community also sought support and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The prayers were also translated into German on the castle square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is strong. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations over several days on Glockenstraße, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake-affected areas. The willingness to help there was also overwhelming.
Hike with a meaty twist - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones simply put it into practice. Either way, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because those who, thanks to the home office, are not in the middle of a stone desert but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests, and meadows, now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least this impression could be gained around Egglburger Lake, where between 12 and 14 o'clock not only dog owners are bustling about.
One reason could, of course, also be that modern humans can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of optimal time slot usage. Because why not learn news from the neighborhood from the long-unseen neighbor while taking a short walk through nature? Or meet the friend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? This way, work and private life could also be combined - who says that the appointment with the tax consultant, lawyer, or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
Another thing that can be done quite well is the purchase of natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, which is placed on a table by the roadside along with small cheese boxes. Or potatoes and meat. It's just a pity if you haven't thought about the purchase beforehand and made the necessary preparations. Thus, an older couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden salesroom of the farmer empty-handed and with regret in their voices. "Too bad, we unfortunately forgot the money."
The disappointment is understandable, as you have a companion with a wallet but no carrying case. You let the friendly acquaintance know this as well. To which the man replies, "That's not true! You do have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket you quickly put on before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an additional head covering unnecessary. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one starts the return journey with a meaty addition and, during this midday short excursion, not only gains a lamb back but also an exceptionally practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be necessary on this day - after dinner. This time, actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 pm, the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, for reasons not yet clear, veered off the road to the right in a left curve, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a guidepost, collided sideways with a tree, and came to a stop several meters away. The driver was trapped in his car due to the collision. The fire department freed him using heavy equipment. The emergency service transported the severely injured man to a hospital. Since there was suspicion of driving incapacity, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss with damages amounting to 1000 Euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: Point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The financial authority must hand over the former president's tax returns to Congress.
Trump 2018, back then still in office as President of the USA
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the tax authority IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the Ministry's decision on Friday.
In contrast to political customs in the US, real estate entrepreneur Trump did not make his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He fought against its release all the way to the Supreme Court. A district attorney's office in New York has since obtained the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public - unless there is a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: there, the circle of authorized persons is somewhat larger, and under certain conditions, individual details could be published during the committee's investigation. Moreover, confidential information is repeatedly leaked from the parliament.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as President," Pelosi stated.
Cabaret at the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, people today rush from appointment to appointment, sometimes squeezing in people and hamburgers in between. Lucy van Kuhl demonstrates in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting about it.
In a humorously thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl narrates and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and crisply pointed cabaret songs, she brings many things to the point - and one or the other can also be found between the lines. The show starts on Saturday, February 18th, at 8:30 pm at the Kirchheimer Club Bastion.
British high-profile criminal captured in Thailand after a long manhunt
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from the United Kingdom has been arrested in Thailand. As the British National Crime Agency (NCA) announced on Saturday, the man was apprehended by Thai police in a car workshop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "Most Wanted" list of most sought-after criminals.
The leader of a criminal group had fled in early 2018 before the start of a trial, according to authorities, in which he was sentenced in absentia to eleven years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the Church Table

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The trained physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statements, loves Viennese humor, champions science in his cabaret programs. This is reflected in the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again". Whether this fits well into the prevailing domestic science skepticism remains to be seen. However, his humor certainly fits very well in Vienna.
The English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. Now he is back and not only shares his experiences overseas with his German-speaking audience, but also explains what science actually is and what it can do - and most importantly, what it cannot. Of course, Corona is also mentioned, as well as German thoroughness in the bathroom and American engineering skills.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off: What is really important? All of this with a huge wink, relaxed and very ironic. And so, not only are we well entertained, but we can also learn something along the way.

General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat action from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles take place in a wide valley, which is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley floor, there are rock pyramids and rock cubes, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy fire.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as agile missiles, which become increasingly difficult to hit during the extended course of the game. Additionally, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player's tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game introduction sequence, the game sequence, the initials input for high scores, and the self-test sequence. The latter mode represents a special sequence for checking the controls and computer function.
Gameplay
The game sequence is triggered when the START pressure switch is activated. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game ends. The game begins with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. A hint could read, for example: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a point becomes visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, representing the enemy position.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, they can be easily targeted on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMY IN FIRE RANGE is simultaneously displayed in the upper left hint display.
Occasionally, UFOs will appear on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless aircraft that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs are meant to round off the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy's tank. A shot down by the player earns them 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: For a slow-moving tank 1,000 points, for a missile 2,000 points, and for a super tank 3,000 points. A super tank moves and rotates twice as fast as the player's tank or an enemy's slow-moving tank. Several options give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4, or even 5 tanks in a game. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined point totals, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the missile can be varied for a more challenging game design. Details and the exact switch positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting option can be found in the illustration.
5. Initial input for top results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the high score table, he or she can enter three (3) personal initials into the table at the end of the game. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that by triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, or interrupting the power supply, the high score table will be deleted. When resetting, the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are preserved and re-entered on the screen to challenge further players. Any score over 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, dashes will be automatically entered by the computer. After this, the device switches back to the attraction game sequence. SETUP ARRANGEMENT
New Parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you have previous experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shift lever. It has been reinforced with several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, making this assembly unit more stable and ensuring the proper function of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always returns the control lever to the middle position. The micro switches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI's X/Y game circuit has been expanded to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the Auxiliary Board. With the help of this circuit technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and steady image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply provided by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash box with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, the device contains a console intended as a platform for smaller players to facilitate gameplay. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should perform some checks to complete the quality control. To be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be made: NOTE: Do not yet connect the device to the 220 V network. A. Check the outside of the case for damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all cable harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose connectors.
NOTE: Never forcefully make plug connections. The plugs are equipped with a forced guidance system, ensuring a correct connection is made. A 180-degree twisted plug connection will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the game PC board for correct and firm fit. (3) Note the production number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check whether the embossed production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board, and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number is on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console, and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-circled opening of the panel. If the opening is not exactly centered, the panel, which is attached with adhesive tape to the housing, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color at the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below you will find a series of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Check the system configuration.

It can happen that other programs take up the system resources that the game needs to run smoothly. Not all of these programs make it obvious that they are active, and many are automatically started when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the reason why your program hangs or crashes. Therefore, we recommend that you close such background applications before you start the game. - If antivirus or crash guard programs are running on your system, you should close or disable them before you start the game. To do this, look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable", "Close", or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as these can sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to close all unnecessary background applications". Clean up the system.
Before you install software, it must be ensured that your hard drive is functioning optimally. Therefore, you should make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need for this are included with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup to ensure everything runs smoothly. Then, there is a high chance that current games will run largely without problems on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage of working much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you use will run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to learn about the ScanDisk or Error Checking, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using the Windows help
Click on the "Start" button and select the "Help" (or "Help and Support") option to access Windows Help. 2.

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
My desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a host of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. It represented a way for me to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the vague feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too focused on "action" and forgot a fundamental element of human experience: sensations. Meanwhile, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of conveying sensations. Even though this could have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but has much more demanding and profound content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both hardcore gamers and casual players will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help to change your attitude in this respect. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we were constantly forced to question many of the principles previously considered inviolable. I would be happy if Fahrenheit - like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also does not pass you by without leaving a trace. David Cage

Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game starts for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. The aim is to acquire as much area as possible without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game is set up so that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. In case of an alarm, the SPARX turn into SUPER-SPARX and become more aggressive. If, while you are trying to draw your territory, your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed, as you cannot cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse is lit and your marker is destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is capable of self-testing, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working flawlessly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches located in the device, the self-test button, and the LEDs on the Video-PC-Board are used.
Programming Display. With this display, the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game operate is selected. The languages can be set using the "Sub-Test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Mission programming. With this display, the difficulty factor for the game can be determined. Furthermore, a "maximum number of credits" that may be present before the start of the game can be set. The text to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch multiple times, the factory or basic setting can be reached, when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (as the green appearing lines are called) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score Value x 10,000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits a player needs in order for their own initials (names) and the hit points to be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, if a coin lock is present, the coin acceptance is blocked. This can set a limited number of games for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99 that by inserting a coin the credits cannot become zero if more than 99 is added. A free play mode can be selected by setting "maximum credits" to 0. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of marking characters per credit.
"Threshold": The percentage number that must be reached to switch to the next round
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Difficulty level of the game process
"Startup sound": no sound at "0" during standby operation
At "1" sound even in stationary operation (animated sound) "Table model": at "0" stationary device
at "1" table device
The credits per coin are set on the "coin slot programming" display. High score program display ("highest hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set the high score, which was selected on the previous display (set to "back"). By pressing the "Up" switch, the initials QIX are set as standard. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "total evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are recorded: Total credit: The number of paid credits. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can only appear as 0 if the battery or the W1 connector is removed, with the device turned off. Left-side coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-side coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Paid credits: Number of credits given for inserted (converted coins). Granted credits: Number of credits given by the device. % Free games: Granted credits (Paid + granted credits per 100) Played minutes: Number of minutes played. Won minutes: Number of minutes in extended or won game. % Free time: Won minutes/played minutes per 100. Average game duration in sec.: Played minutes/paid + granted credits.
High Score (Hit Rate): Number of times a player had a high enough hit rate to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are reset to 0. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears.
Deposit slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the installer can choose a standard coin setting or program another setting.
If a standard setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches selects the programming while the top digit glows green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After a single press, the top setting number is set to 0, which means that a custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not suitable. Once the setting has been made, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. If pressed unintentionally, the standard setting appears. The values can be increased or reduced with the "Up" and "Down" switch. The process is completed by pressing the "Test" switch. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") indicates how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin units - "Credit" shows the number of required units before a credit is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min. Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. In the standard setting, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (memory) FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory default settings. This condition likely indicates a battery failure or error.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" button or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for each program display, by pressing the "Test" switch, the next program is displayed each time. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test begins in the auto-test mode. In this program, the device will continuously perform the hardware test until it is switched off. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" display appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. With plug J 19 removed, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are carried out as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results.
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for this ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the incorrect checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM to be replaced is displayed on the LED display. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board.
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking if the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the Communications RAM fails during the Video Board test, the error could be due to faulty wiring (RAM) or errors in the Data Board. To locate the error, remove the Data Board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Error in U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are reset to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or the decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These number sequences are checked for accuracy when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, and associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (Display RAM). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these inscriptions are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to halt and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next check is being started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That's also the reason for star No. 1. The second star is for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I had oriented myself based on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it is supposed to fit so tightly and I didn't want to struggle into a S or M with my bust size.... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and at the hips...but I could swim in the rest. Also, the lining material already came out when opening the package and spread everywhere. Just a shame.. It will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. It can be worn well on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will surely be worn next year as well. We can recommend an order.
Robust Quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and it's not optimal. Unfortunately, I mismeasured and the pad doesn't quite fit. But that's my mistake. I slightly altered it so it fits. The pad seems very robust and the edges are no longer damaged. You can use the groove or the entire surface. It worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is quite okay, but not for under one year. The chewing surface is too large for a small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it because of the size. Now at 12 months, we've brought it out again and he can use it. He hasn't been able to bite anything off with his few existing teeth. And when it's been in the fridge, it soothes him a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately returning
I was probably misled by the sometimes overly enthusiastic reviews here. I would like to preface by saying that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has now become too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that it (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that's just not true! I really hoped that it was, but there can be no talk of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer the same protection as my Lowepro. Even the dividers inside are of a different caliber, much flimsier. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly high quality. Therefore, I have decided for myself that the backpack is going back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of EUR, then I unfortunately also have to spend the money for a decent backpack. Quality apparently has its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked was the color inside. Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far, I liked the Electric series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. In this part, it's all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything and then acts like a little child and sulks in every argument?! At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't be without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this was the last part of the series and think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's friend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more tension back into the story.
Humanity destroys everything, appreciates nothing, and never learns! First of all: The movie is not as bad as many people say. Sure, the story is totally contrived, and always designed according to the same formula. If you've seen the beginning, you know how it ends. And the message is always the same: Humanity destroys everything, appreciates nothing, and never learns! And that's exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How often during the movie I thought (even though I know it's just a movie, and the animals are computer-generated): Oh my God, the poor animals, it often brings tears to your eyes. Therefore, Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is really well made. It's just a shame that people don't get the message behind the movie, even though it's a mainstream film. We consistently destroy animals, the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: none. 4 stars, because the movie is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Still, well-made popcorn cinema.
A quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film like 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be. This film is primarily "French" - it is also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and can bring one to tears - if one engages with it and expects nothing from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90s, supposedly orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, absolutely nothing. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has persisted for 1 week. It is worth noting that only 2 stars were given for the smaller package size (unfortunately only noticed too late), while the larger one got a full 5? That is very very strange!
Terrible smell and poor results! I dyed my blonde hair to a chocolate brown with an intense tint in October, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time, I immediately noticed that it smelled terrible! However, the result was not too bad, it turned out to be a chestnut brown (somewhat darker). Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it again, as instructed in the manual for unsatisfactory results. This time it was a complete waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked the same as the first attempt. The worst part was, it still smelled weeks after the application.. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just wouldn't go away.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for quite a long time now, always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin levels have been low for a while due to my work, lack of exercise, and a prolonged additional illness. I wanted to boost my immune system not only through healthy eating but also by taking Vitamin D3 and K2. This is working very well. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed more easily. The price is also great considering how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not entirely flawless!!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following major defects which I find very disturbing: 1) Over time, the case has problems "connecting" with the phone. This means that it no longer charges even though the "Power On/Off" button has been pressed for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and reinstalling it solves the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I have almost lost it several times. These may not be many major defects, but I believe that a case with a battery should function flawlessly in its function and therefore I am very disappointed with the product for the cost of 30€, especially since I have only been using it for 3 months.
Way too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews came about. Ultimately, it's really just a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get as a gift from any optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I expected much more from these cloths, it is also really very thin. Since I have used it, I unfortunately cannot return it. I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these cloths is far too high, more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (it has already fallen into the shower), reproduces bass as bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to wet the suction cup, otherwise it will come off.. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were represented quite naturally in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to deduct a star for that. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
In a few places, the paint had chipped off and if you just ran your hand over it, the paint would come off in some places. We wanted to have it picked up for free because we didn't want it anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but how if both dressers were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer. Amazon took care of everything for us and refunded our money. Kudos to Amazon.
Better to spend a bit more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no additional protection. Since the mailman stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't complain because I urgently needed this product. The included adhesive hardly holds, but it sticks properly - like chewing gum that doesn't harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together. The stencils are partially incompletely punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party, it's okay, but for a wedding, I would invest a bit more money and go for a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closures + nice appearance + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired.
- Doors slam due to magnets (can possibly be balanced with rubber knobs) - some unclean spots
- The supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (I had no others and since there was no trophy in the house, I glued them with craft glue) - the brackets for the insert shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped it with some paper and balanced it) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, as you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Also, I find it a bit too expensive for that.
I like the coffee....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, in my opinion, the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). Therefore, I would have given 5 stars. Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon scores full points.
It gets on my nerves
The alarm clock arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up. However, the natural sounds are terrible and extremely loud. I couldn't turn them down. Probably a defect, supposedly it's possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, I would immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned my face towards the alarm clock because I thought it was already morning. But when it was time and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and the color change, unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery, so you don't have to re-enter the time and alarm time in case of a power outage. But for the reasons mentioned, it was returned.
Lighting great, workmanship insufficient
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, as the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board is laughing at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "Pay for 6 - receive 4" is not a good deal. Surely Amazon would have handled this generously and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. However, it is not a good indication of the quality of these light bulbs - so far the only reason for deducting two stars. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color tends more towards cool white. Perfect for hallway, study, workshop, laundry room etc. For living rooms, I would personally opt for warmer light. Comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do this too and maybe I will also get intact specimens according to the order there. If my review is helpful, I would appreciate a positive rating. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received the items, and I would like to share my first impressions. Yes, positive. I thought long and hard about whether to order this set or not. **The material is sturdy and it feels good in the hand. **All the utensils have a hole in the handle for hanging. **The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use with coated pans. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. **They do not conduct heat, so they can be handled directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone. But a quick wipe and they're gone. In conclusion, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend it.
B-Stock Sold as New Stock
Amazon Prime shipping is simply top-notch. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all parts. We found that the part had already been installed once. We noticed significant scratches and scuffs on all assembly parts. The hose connections/fittings were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only then did we see that there were also scratch marks / streaks on the chrome faucet itself. This part was probably already delivered and returned. We will keep this faucet and install it in the basement sink because it doesn't matter how it looks there. Our conclusion; We will never order such goods from Amazon again, but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we get decent goods. I find it simply sad that customers are being deceived like this!!!
The product itself is top-notch, unfortunately the external sensor broke after just 6 months.
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the range is very good, with no problems transmitting from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can be either mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the outside values seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, as it continues to display plausible values. However, the hygrometer seems to be gone, as it constantly displays completely astronomical values of outside humidity. This is very unfortunate, as the device was installed outside in a protected place and is also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Powerful mower with weak catcher
Aside from the fact that the first delivery attempt is still cheerfully traveling around the republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was as always excellent. The mower arrived quickly and made a high-quality impression. The engine is strong and it produces a nice cut. The noise level is not impressively low, but okay. The big drawback is unfortunately the grass catcher. For one, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you set it down briefly when it's full, it naturally gets compressed and parts of the contents fall out. Worse, however, is that the otherwise practical fill level indicator already shows red when the grass catcher is only half full. This wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't start losing large parts of the cuttings from that point on. Emptying the catcher on a large lawn area when it's only half full can't be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable, which can be extended if necessary, is very good. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to conserve battery life, they are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, is quite fiddly to close again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and reinsert them after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not been able to level the hotbed correctly to this day. The right rear locking screw is fully tightened, yet the hotbed is still too high there, and the screw on the front right is practically falling out because it is not tightened at all, even though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the carriage are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what can be done, because it is impossible to print anything like this. Regarding the assembly: The assembly was quite trouble-free, it would only be helpful to show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very strenuous. I have already written to support, but after a week of waiting, I still have not received a reply. Unfortunately, returning it is no longer possible. I had expected a bit more.
Robust and precise, I'm positively surprised.
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one was needed. This one here makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Included are two batteries, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the caliper is simple, but fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the caliper leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full marks for it and believe it will last at least as long as the old caliper. From me, there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and initially did not wear it because it emitted a disgusting smell. To this day, the smell has not gone away, even though it was constantly "aired out". Since return is no longer possible, I have disposed of it. I advise against buying it.
Okay for the price
The stars and balls on this chain are personally a bit too big for me, making it look quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I find quite nice. However, the chain is overall very simply made, so I have already torn the clasp twice. So far, I have always been able to repair it, but I think that it will not last/hold for long. But for the low price, you simply cannot expect anything really high quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't come undone, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it even softer and more pliable. Just a note: if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, junk! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after some fiddling.... if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and inserted it again, did the transmitters finally connect. Unfortunately, my joy about this did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, not usable for me! The thing went back! I would definitely advise against buying, it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump once before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft had rusted. I bought it again for one reason only, I urgently needed it due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge would fit. I hope that the shaft of the previous pump had a production error and the current pump lasts a bit longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packaging the pump a bit better in the future, rather than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway, as mentioned above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
It could have been better thought out. As I often deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than constantly carrying around a huge bunch of keys. Initially, everything went quite well. However, the paint quickly started to peel off and the screws had to be constantly tightened. It's nice that this can be done with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I couldn't find a suitable flathead screwdriver that wouldn't have immediately ruined the entire screw. Now to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths using the various parts, but once you've screwed everything together, you need pliers to take it all apart again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance, and skill. Ultimately, the screw broke off in the thread the third time I assembled it, rendering the entire thing useless. Conclusion: If at all, then only for once all necessary keys and then never again, but at the price, you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Does not quite match the specified dimensions
The zippers are smooth, the material seems sturdy, and all of this at a featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to truly assess the product after the first use. I can already say that the height is less than stated. At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything for a three-week vacation there. If necessary, the really large items can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 pieces were delivered, as there were two smaller bags/pouches included in the round cosmetic bag. Not high-quality workmanship, but I wanted to mention it anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's okay.
So-so
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it no longer worked. Battery? Replaced. But it still doesn't work. So, I might as well have thrown the money directly into the trash can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but one should be very careful with the brush to avoid damaging the needle. I could not discern an improvement in sound on my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Included were two black cables. The battery life lasts a very long time. Definitely completely sufficient sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Purchase recommendation in this price range.
Chic dress
A very beautiful dress that is suitable for a variety of occasions. The price-performance ratio is completely right here, especially since I also bought it in a flash sale. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (as was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a bit more fabric (if you don't have quite as slim upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Stay away. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold these days. The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It is assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVDs usually work, Blu-rays are recognized at best unreliably. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes grinding noises as you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes, you can either restart the computer because it won't get any better or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or do anything at all. This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for an additional fee, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First and foremost, I want to point out that the two USB ports are somewhat deceptive, as only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging various devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know this when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a simple extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But apart from the aesthetics and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around like it would with a normal extension cord. So it's not a complete waste of money, but my enthusiasm is somewhat limited :-).
Small but powerful! I bought this product so that I could have an audio output on my iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12, you can now also transfer data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters, which I had to send back, unfortunately could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller connected to the tablet via BT and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter included which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to provide stability and also has a magnetic holder. It doesn't fit with my case and the adapter. Well, it holds securely and has contact anyway... All in all, a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, it's very small and sturdily made from a piece of aluminum. The price-performance ratio is right.
Plenty of power
Top device. It's been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet but it delivers a lot of power. I find the middle temperature setting a bit too cool and therefore always use level 2. It has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived well. And I also like the simple design. Competing products often look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not give a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised. In live mode, the location is accurate to about 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, it does tend to jump a few meters, but this is not disturbing. I would buy it again at any time. However, it would be great if the battery lasted longer. Currently, it lasts about 1.5 days. A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version, but unfortunately, it is too big for our taste, the battery doesn't need to last that long for us and we find changing it daily impractical. You should be spending time with your dog, not with his collar :-). The app also works perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem to be comfortable. However, the lifespan is decreasing more and more. Even though my son only wears the shoes for physical education, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair, it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the class. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive trash and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered a new pair. These, however, appear poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I previously owned. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but upon closer inspection, you can see that the edges are poorly made and the heel strap is quite loose and will likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was initially very skeptical. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it on good luck. The delivery included the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I test laid it in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it off and hope that it does not reappear. A lying test was carried out in the inflated state. It is comfortable to lie on and is perfect for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. We removed the seats in the back beforehand. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the soldering point). Since my boyfriend is handy, he was able to repair it and once reassembled, the pump worked excellently and inflated the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very excited about the mattress. I am looking forward to the stress test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and lasts a long time. Also, that the mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend it. If I should have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar tore open on day 1 due to poor craftsmanship, revealing several doors. By the 21st door, there were no doors left and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts as they were practically falling out. The parts often come out mixed up which often means that you have to disassemble the car to attach the parts. Once the car is fully assembled, parts fall off during play. (Mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach.) I would not buy this calendar again and would not recommend it to anyone. Perhaps the manufacturers will reconsider the way they have designed the calendar for the next edition and do it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies it. It flies very well indoors and the 5 min. flight time is usually more than enough. I expected that hair would get stuck in it and the drone would break very quickly at this price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are not a problem. Nice contact for questions.
The game is okay but can only be played with mandatory use of Steam. I didn't notice at the time of purchase that it wasn't a game CD but merely a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine, but you are forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, the computer constantly freezes, which certainly wouldn't be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life.
I was really looking forward to the watch. The design and appearance were great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. The operation worked well.... and yet I am sending it back. The big catch: the battery and its lifespan. Charged in the evening, left on the shelf overnight and 11% less battery in the morning without use. If many messages came during the day, the battery was already depleted by noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time anymore. Therefore, it's not useful for me. Very unfortunate.
Elegant case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, one should definitely get a case. I have recently liked cases in which you can also insert a credit card. This case offers that. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case seems sturdy and well made. It looks elegant. The phone is embedded all around, unlike many other cases, with only cutouts at the connections. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even on the QI charging station made of leather from TORRO, it doesn't work. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise, it's really chic and well made!
High-quality case with tempered glass film
A robust case with a proper armored glass for screen protection in a classic design provides all-around protection for the entire iPhone 11. It fits very well and can also be easily applied. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not get dirty. A truly successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It is not too bulky and fits tightly on the phone. Overall a good purchase.
