And, if you can, pray for us, naming all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
‚ÄîA letter from the occupation.
Kherson.
"Natasha, we are holding on as hard as we can.
It feels like they are afraid.
They are very afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat several times that they are big, that they are strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and our head spins - how are you, ladies, afraid, if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat this greatness.
How insecure you are.
It's like sexual intercourse with an impotent person, who needs to be told endlessly that he is strong, that he can do everything, for a very long and stubborn time for him to try and at the same time think when this painful abuse will finally end.
We repeat this to save us all.
Because it is very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless body with a machine gun.
Because later, when this evil is expelled from our land, we will have to organize the city.
No matter who we are talking to now, they all have the same words.
The words that the city smells of rot.
We will probably need a lot of detergents just to wash the sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time. Because everything these non-humans have touched smells of rot.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were big.
Three healthy men undressed her and left her on the street, forbidding anyone to approach her to help.
For three hours she stood undressed on the street and only spoke loudly:
"Don't come near me, my dears.
Do not put yourself in danger.
Please!
We will still have a lot to do with you...
Then!
And more.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It is even difficult for me to imagine that they do not steal.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting with children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because leaflets are constantly being posted in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the ZSU.
And when they are close, the Kherson people will deal with impurity with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they hurry.
And we will wait.
Let's wait.
We will clench our teeth, clench our fists until the fingers are numb and wait.
Because we have something to look forward to.
To be once and for all.
And none of this uncleanness remained.
And then we will wash the city.
Long.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, naming all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
The author of the writing is not indicated for obvious reasons.
and I need communication. I messed something up. I know that few people want to communicate with sour people, but I still don't lose hope
How satisfied are you with housing?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same profession as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar questions are currently reflected by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in the framework of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The conclusions will help to better understand their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
Everyone who provided a functional e-mail when requesting humanitarian assistance will receive an invitation to the survey (from the address invitation@click4survey.cz).
The questionnaire is filled out by everyone only once!
By filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
PRODUCTION TECHNICIAN
,MECHANIC AT THE PRODUCTION
We make electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics or modern medicines - none of this would be possible without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues in our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities to both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I would like to say a few words about this.
There is a great desire to gather with the residents to discuss important, exciting issues, but the gathering is prohibited by law, because there is a war in the country.
I will be grateful for sound advice and any help in my desire to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are a force.
Together we will overcome all difficulties.
Together we will win.
So apply.
I will listen to everyone.
I will be infinitely glad and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the government of the Czech Republic approved a change in the conditions for the payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all arriving Ukrainian refugees are entitled to a first aid payment of 5,000 kroner without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
In order to receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation ‚Äì be considered unemployed, have no property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The first payment of assistance will cease to be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, multiple daily meals and hygiene items, he will not be able to claim the 5,000 kroner payment.
The authorities will begin to believe that the basic aid was provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and there is no need to pay money.
This measure is designed to solve the problem with Gypsy refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for financial aid.
2Ô∏è‚É£ as before, only those refugees who prove an immediate need (lack of work, etc.) will have the right to cash payment of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth benefits.
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå as in the first point, only those Ukrainians who were not provided with free housing, multiple daily meals and hygiene supplies will be able to receive financial assistance;
üìå the applicant must actually live in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary in order to stop the practice of "tourism for the sake of help", when a refugee lives in one country and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days solely for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about a change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address in the application form for the payment of benefits does not match the address indicated in the database of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she really lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the payment of assistance will be refused.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion crowns on the payment of humanitarian aid.
And today I spent the whole day digging in defensive structures, and the whole city is being dug in, some not very happy forecasts for the near future.
To be honest, I am tired, it is very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, for this someone needs to organize equipment and people, and I am the head of the village, so these are my duties
All utility companies are involved, and we are also appealing to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We must unite, because otherwise we will not overcome the katsaps
There is a lot of propaganda so that people lose hope and weaken their resistance
To be honest, I haven't picked up a shovel today yet, I hope I won't have to
My children put girly stickers on my phone case so that I don't forget that I'm female
What will happen if the bill is passed?
‚òòÔ∏è A governmental Commission will be formed from representatives of the Office of the President, some ministries and business associations, which will quickly review the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
‚òòÔ∏è By the end of the year, the Commission and other executive authorities will review all permit documents for conducting business in most areas.
And they will suggest which permits or procedures need to be removed.
‚òòÔ∏è The Cabinet will remove all "unnecessary" permits and procedures in an accelerated mode.
Without any public discussion, behind the scenes!
‚òòÔ∏è It will not matter whether the decisions of the Cabinet contradict the current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of economic activities that may harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
‚òòÔ∏è Business regulation by the state will be based on the principle of "one new permit - minus two old ones."
Whether or not it makes any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
‚òòÔ∏è In the background mode, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents regarding permits or procedures in the field of the environment.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc. will all be at risk!
‚òòÔ∏è Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We won't even know how and who is changing the by-laws until the final decisions are made.
‚òòÔ∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the possibility of influence are business associations.
Bill No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Short deadlines for review of permits, non-transparent procedure, lack of any decision-making criteria - this is a movement somewhere to the east, not to the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support them wholeheartedly
They told her - grandmother, the Russians came to the village; Grab your cat and climb into the beads.
But she refused - what am I, an old mare... Save the children and girls, I'll stop right here... Grandma goes down to the cellar, shovels cucumbers, Rolls away a tub with junk, a pile of troughs; There are doors with iron bolts and silver locks.
And someone is rattling chains behind the door.
I didn't think - says the grandmother - that I would live.
Seventy-odd years - and again a rod.
Go - just don't be angry, because damn it, You will bring "Putin kaput" closer to us.
The lady's cat hisses, the glass cracks in the windows.
Tanks rumble and slide between houses.
Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Good afternoon, go to the post office and confirm your identity through "check-in", then upon confirmation you will be given a code, and you must enter this code again during online registration and you are done.
The bank card must be registered to the person who wants to receive financial assistance, another is not suitable.
I did so to an acquaintance, it also indicated that a key was needed, but when she persisted, waited in the government office, they told her why she had come because she was already registered.
It also showed her, in this application, that some kind of key is needed, but in fact the registration is already taking place without it
help me too, the application was made online on May 5, but something is wrong with understanding whether to go to the labor government or wait
it is written that you will receive money on the card after processing your application, but it says that the identity has not been confirmed, the banking system gives an error
Good afternoon, dear Ms. Angelino!
I would like to express my point of view regarding the use of "in" / "on" in relation to the word "Ukraine".
The use of this term has become a serious political issue in recent decades.
Today's war of Russia against Ukraine was prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy
Thank you for the interesting exercises and tasks, for the clear explanation of grammar, and pleasant communication.
We especially thank you for the technical support of training, first of all, for the textbook, which made it possible to understand what was sometimes not learned in lectures.
These three months laid the foundation of our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish the entire creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions, he popularizes world classics in the Ukrainian language, among them "Lolita" (V. Nabokov), "Perfumer" (P. Zyuskind), "Sin" by M. Kotsyubynskyi, "Letter of a Stranger" and "Wild" by S. Zweig, etc. (and etc.).
The works that he enacts are difficult to understand and require an investment of soul and heart.
The author deliberately brings the audience to deep emotions and tears.
In his opinion, tears are cleansing, this is the way to the recovery of modern man.
Has a number of awards.
In 2005, he received the title of "People's Artist of Ukraine", laureate of the Taras Shevchenko National Prize of Ukraine (2007), but most of all Mr. Mykhailo appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate.
Admirers of Mr. Mykhailo's talent hope that after the end of the war, they will again hear him play the saxophone, see his unparalleled ability to reincarnate, and be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art
Minerals of Ukraine
By origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Therefore, their placement is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
Fuel minerals mined in our country include: hard and brown coal, oil, natural gas, peat, oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully provides its own needs for hard and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we have a rational economy, acute shortages can arise in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissia.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as a fuel only for local needs in rural areas, farms, glass, porcelain and earthenware, and food industries.
Various chemical substances are also obtained from peat, in particular acetone, phenols, paraffin, fodder, and yeast.
There are considerable deposits of combustible shale in the Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions.
The geography of the location of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, so they are included in the covers of old and young platforms, as well as in marginal foothill depressions.
Coal.
Hard coal makes up 94.3% of the coal deposits of our country.
Ukrainian hard coal is distinguished by its high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine, there are deposits of the best grade of coal - anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of coal is coking.
After special processing, it is used during the smelting of iron and steel.
In terms of discovered hard coal reserves, Ukraine ranks 8th in the world and 1st in Europe, and in terms of production, it ranks 11th and 3rd, respectively.
Explored coal reserves in Ukraine amount to about 50 billion tons.
Estimated reserves are about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write "messages" on shells that are dropped on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
For example, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the Eurovision stage to save the soldiers blocked at "Azovstal" in Mariupol - and the very next day, the Russians wrote on the shells "Kalush, as you asked! #on Azovstal".
On April 8, 2022, the Russian military fired at the station in Kramatorsk with the words "For the children" written on them.
At that time, 61 people, including 7 children, died from shells with a cynical inscription.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared during the First World War.
During World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies.
Back then, it helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on shells by the Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they don't like Ukraine's political course.
Russia must be stopped so that such "messages" do not fly to any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing greeted us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
"We are taking insulin, it needs a temperature regime - it cannot be heated.
Is it possible to pass the control in an accelerated mode?"
The border guard allowed us to stand at the beginning of the queue, even the trucks graciously gave way.
Lviv
The city of the Lion is alive.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body - an endless stream of people.
People from all regions of the country found shelter and a sense of security here.
Some go on to Europe, some return home, some stay.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at roadblocks around the city.
The war is reflected in the dictation windows of cathedrals.
She wraps monuments and sculptures with white cloths.
But the war cannot be heard on Rynok Square, where thousands of voices are heard at the same time, nor can it be heard in cafes and bars, where people continue to live.
Yes, life calms down earlier - at 11 p.m., life hides from the curfew.
But it is there: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 o'clock in the evening and announced the alarm, it could only be heard from a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpin
We paved the way to Kyiv through two of the numerous martyr cities - through Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities in which the air smells of hope.
Despite the pain, people return and rebuild their lives.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Shell fragments or automatic rounds?..)
A Ukrainian flag is stretched on the shattered balcony.
There are holes near the front door, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And at this front door, three people are scrambling.
They clean, repair, build a wall and with it a new life.
And a mother and child are walking in the park two blocks below.
I can't help but ask myself: "Did their dad survive the shooting of the men in Bucha?
Will he still walk with them?"
On the way out of Irpen there is a car cemetery.
These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and which were mercilessly shot by the Russian occupiers.
This cemetery has already become an object of a kind of "patriotic tourism".
If you go deep and stand surrounded by autoskeletons, you can feel a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slowed down air, such an impression that it can be cut with a knife.
And weeks have passed since the death of the passengers...
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.
And in one of the cars - an abandoned bicycle, in the other - warm children's overalls.
Somewhere there is an unburnt booklet with instructions for using the airbag.
Remains of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
We drive on, I look back to look at the city for the last time - and my eyes come across the same bridge under which the frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, but it was on these broken plates that the Ukrainian military carried a child in white.
This child in the white overalls must have survived.
But is there a chance that the child who wore the clothes left in one of the cars is still alive?
A man sits on a broken bridge with a camera over his shoulder.
He just sits and looks at the gap between Kyiv and Bucha.
He does not take pictures, but only looks.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge and thinks: how is it?
"Happy holiday!" - exclaims the man joyfully to us. - "Happy City Day!"
On May 29, military Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Mykolaiv
A hero city, an outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A front-line city that the occupiers still cannot capture.
And we believe that they will not capture - the city is fighting and living.
On street corners, at every second intersection, there are neatly stacked piles of tires and Bandera lanes.
Evening Mykolaiv is now incredibly quiet - the noise against which the city used to live has subsided.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And at night it is extremely dark.
Light masking for safety.
People live "by candles", or rather, by the flashlights of mobile phones.
At home, we turn on the light only in the kitchen - quickly and when needed.
Grandma covered the windows with heavy blankets, through which the light does not penetrate.
There is a hunting rifle next to my sister's childhood bed.
"At hand since the 24th," says the father.
When there are air alarms and sounds of explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in a front-line city, it is very difficult to live in a state of constant anxiety.
When then to live?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers from the city, shots from "pions" reach the Zhovtnevy district, covering Kulbakyne.
It flies close to my relatives several times.
On the next block, across the street from us.
To the grandmother's neighbors - the grandmother's windows were blown out, the children took them to their place, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of Ingul and Central districts.
Life goes on.
A siren is wailing on the central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple is sitting on a bench, talking about something, calmly discussing it.
A cyclist passes them.
Watching with dad - what will we do?
"So what... Shall we go and drink some coffee?"
So we are sitting on Sobornia Street (the former Soviet Street, by the way) in the park near the monument to St. Nicholas.
And what else to do?
To be honest, when a siren catches you by surprise on the street, there is often nowhere to hide, there are no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every resident of Mykolaiv.
On the lawn near the entrance lies a huge trident - once decorated by the State Administration.
Now there is an empty "nothing" in the place where the trident used to show off.
The same as in the place of the office of the head of the Regional State Administration and a dozen offices around.
The missile landed squarely on Kim's desk.
The war takes on a completely different shape when it is not in the news, but underfoot.
I walk through the corridors of the ODA, and with every step I hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor - someone submitted requests and statements, but now it does not matter.
On the table of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag.
There is a flower on the bedside table.
They took her home, transplanted her, let her live.
They met the security guard who was on duty on March 29.
survived
"It was patched up, sewn up," he points to his head. "Already at work."
Only journalists can enter the State Administration.
A couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC are with us.
Photos, direct inclusions, interviews.
According to official data, 36 people died.
This is "September 11 in the Mykolaiv style", "a monument to the Russian measure", comments the press attache of the regional head.
The Mykolaiv regional state administration is just one of the wounds on Mykolaiv's body.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even when Denmark helps restore the ODA, the people of Mykolaiv will always see a terrible emptiness in it.
Russia has started a new "gas war".
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transport system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped supplying gas to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline.
Official Berlin expects that Russia will cut off natural gas supplies this way already in July.
Russia also used such blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
Gas has always been for Russia not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the first priority is the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West.
Financing the economy of the Russian Federation is to pay for the third world war.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will enable Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and trying to rapidly diversify gas and oil supplies.
But in order to become energy independent from Russian energy, the EU needs time.
Meanwhile, Putin's regime threatens Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and lack of heating in homes.
European countries, especially dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may feel its shortage.
But this crisis will stimulate a more frugal attitude to natural resources and increase energy efficiency.
Europe will win when it gives up Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
Temporary discomfort is worth enduring so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia burns the crops in Ukrainian fields.
The army of the Russian Federation uses incendiary shells that destroy ripe crops of grain and oil crops.
With this, Russia causes the spread of hunger in the world.
Due to the Russian war, the number of people in the world suffering from a lack of food may increase by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, the Russians steal already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, and block sea exports.
The destruction of the agricultural potential of Ukraine is another manifestation of the military aggression of the Russian Federation.
Thus, Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digitization is launching an innovative hotline format ‚Äî the Diya.Business virtual center.
Forced migrants from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registration of their own stay, business registration, employment and assistance.
Therefore, the Diya.Business virtual center is being launched in order to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format until Ukrainians can return home.
It's scary how you have to fear every important day, and how you never know a day or a minute that may come
Good afternoon, Hanna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician again and ask when the next time you can come for Darusi's vaccination.
They were supposed to be tomorrow, I can't come because the battery in the car needs to be replaced, it will be there by the end of the week.
The neighbor brought the cable and we charged from Marina's car.
But on the panel of the car it says that the battery needs to be replaced.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia should bring it from Ukraine, and then it will be replaced for me
I will try to start the car tomorrow, if it works, we will go alone, I will leave my grandmother in the car and will not turn off the engine.
If I don't start it, then I will write to you and you will come for us
It is very inconvenient for me to bother you, distract you from work.
Okay, let's go with you at 11:45, so as not to risk it.
"The war is not over yet, and the fates of our new neighbors are also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escape to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure journey they are embarking on together, only to put them in hastily loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all adults who still don't quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
Stories of children for whom the only memory of home is a toy they could hold on to during many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, the organizers emphasize.
At the end of each trip - return to a safe house.
But this trip is different, scarier.
This trip is not over even after more than eight months.
Return home is expected.
The theme of war is omnipresent, so our walk may seem redundant.
On the contrary, in the conditions of increasing antipathies and hostile attitudes in society, which are incited and exploited by populists, we want to point out that involuntary travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in poetic form and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
They are now part of it."
Despite such a painful topic, the parade was nevertheless made bright and encouraging.
Masters and craftswomen contributed to this, who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, tangles, houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade went from Kampa to Vaclavak, and at each stop a huge performance was played, the dramaturgy of which was developed by the Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to preserve the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians are facing now," says the playwright. "Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects normal life that is interrupted by an air attack.
Glowing birds are the first to come to the rescue - they cover children first of all with their wings.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of protecting wings becomes even more relevant.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song spreads through the column.
And all creatures came back to life: sunflowers, moths, toys, and even houses.
Such symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and to every Czech who helped and continues to help Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we will be able to overcome this difficult path and safety will prevail in homes."
The wife sends the husband to the market for snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, the man meets friends and gets drunk for three days, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
He thinks to tell his wife why he has been gone for so long.
He rings the doorbell, spills the snails on the floor, his wife opens it, he, pushing them with his hands, says:
- Well, here they are!
We go in, we go in, we go in...
Our editorial staff spoke with Ukrainian refugee Marina, who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.
"Currently, I am trying to realize myself as an artist," said the Ukrainian.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, concern for relatives.
In the conversation with Maryna, a refugee from Ukraine, one can see her confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she found herself with her children.
But the woman believes in her own strength and is trying to adapt to life in Prague, without abandoning the idea of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Marina is from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children - a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect at the Nikopol State Institution.
"By education I am an architect of buildings and structures, I graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Before that, she studied at an art school, graduated from a lyceum with a specialty of "artist-decorator", - said Marina.
And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina, without thinking twice, left Ukraine with her children.
Prague became a refuge for the woman.
"Of course, it's a new city, big, crowded... It's a new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs say to me.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
In addition, I am not ashamed to ask for help from the Czechs and I have never felt any aggression from them.
I thank them for that," Marina shared.
According to her, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time in solving issues related to finding housing, obtaining a visa and insurance, and submitting documents to receive benefits.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the kindergarten
After receiving a tolerated stay visa, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
"Of course, I want to find a job in my field.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands..." she said.
"They didn't take us to kindergarten because there are no places.
They say that it is necessary to look for adaptation groups for children, but no one specifically knows where they are.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She tried to help me find a place in a kindergarten for children, calling a number of different authorities, but..." Marina continues.
"In general, I am very concerned about the state of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient.
I can't say that the children are bothering me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to attend Czech language courses.
Once I went to a Czech class with the little ones, so they played a little, and then they started to behave restlessly.
As a normal mother, I was distracted, I couldn't study properly... If there were language courses for adults with children or with small ones, someone would be there during the training... But my daughter is so attached to me," the woman sighs.
"Of course, together with our children, we go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which we are very grateful to the Czech Republic," Marina added.
When the children sleep, Marina engages in self-education, learns Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
One day, Marina was looking at vacancies on the Internet and saw an announcement: "Within the framework of the initiative of the Association "Spolek Zaedno" with the support of the EC representation in the Czech Republic, "12 stars for Ukraine", we are organizing a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes and paints.
Only creative imagination is required from the participants...".
Marina could not fail to take advantage of this opportunity.
"I gathered courage and applied for participation.
Everyone was invited to a meeting, where we painted all day.
Before that, I didn't sleep, I worried.
Besides, I haven't picked up a paintbrush in six years," said the Ukrainian woman.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists.
"The theme of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use the Ukrainian theme in our works - we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.
That's why the collection of paintings is dominated by blue-yellow colors," Marina added.
30 applicants took part in the event, of which only 12 were selected.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings will be held in Prague with their participation, with the support of the EU representation in the Czech Republic.
"That's how it is in life.
All your once-acquired knowledge and skills can come in handy, and also support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," Marina noted.
"Now I'm trying to realize myself as an artist.
Every step is a fight against your fears and yourself.
But something must be done...", the woman said.
Marina is indebted to the Czech Republic for its hospitality and friendliness, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.
Active hostilities continue in the south of Ukraine.
Residents of temporarily occupied and front-line settlements continue to leave for safer areas.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will need a lot of time to fully recover from the full-scale war started by Russia.
However, Ukrainians are not waiting for better times, but have already begun to clear their cities and villages of Russian garbage, rebuilding the infrastructure.
Kyiv region took the brunt of the blow in the first days of the full-scale war, when the Russian invaders wanted to break into the capital and capture it in a few days.
These cities and villages survived active hostilities, atrocities of the Russian army, and in some places - occupation.
At the beginning of April, the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksandr Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after active hostilities and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are rebuilding their homes and public space.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia began a new stage of this war - an informational one.
The Russian Federation is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce the support of Ukraine from the international community.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces fight against the aggressor, and thus become complicit in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report: the Ukrainian military sets up positions on the territory of civil infrastructure facilities.
At the same time, she ignored the fact that it is only about objects from which the civilian population has been completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to informational attacks of the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia attacked Ukraine, seizes its territories, kills and tortures the civilian population, destroys cities and villages.
The Russian Federation is guilty of the war, it has no right to any actions on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and expel the enemy from the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine resist Russia on all fronts!
I am sure that every person in the world has ever dreamed of his perfect house.
Believe me or not, I am no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.
It would be next to the beach and have a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I will definitely be happy to live in the heart of picturesque landscapes.
My house would be a two-story cottage with a beautiful exotic garden in front of the house, and there would be many different flowers and fruit trees..
I will also have a garage for my car.
By car, I will be able to go to work, shopping or just travel with my family, wherever our eyes lead us.
My ideal house will have at least six rooms: a bright and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, an office with a workplace and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with bedside tables and chests of drawers.
There will be many interesting books in the bookcases in the office.
The living room will become the most visited place in the house, where the whole family could gather together, share news or just have fun.
That's why there would be a large sofa with small pillows, several armchairs, a chest of drawers, a huge TV and a long built-in fish tank.
Also, my ideal home would have a loft where we can make a home theater or entertainment room.
Behind my house would be a pool with some hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we could do exercises every day to keep fit or just play different team sports like volleyball, basketball, soccer, etc.
My ideal house would be big and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I would really like to live in it.
But this is just my dream... I have to make it come true.
Hello, how many people should there be so that I know which room to prepare? Is it one room?
I gave the letters to you as a secretary
Yes, of course, I am asking how many there are so that I know where to settle them
Of course, you tell me right away what I would know
To have time to clean the room
Also, tell me how to send a parcel to Ukraine. My daughter-in-law is due to give birth on the 6th and she probably needs our help. She is now alone at such a time. I cannot leave her without support, she is my only granddaughter.
Products, diapers.
It's just that I'm going to bed on June 6.
I was released from the maternity hospital for only 10 days.
I did not have time to buy everything for the child.
There is no bedding yet, a blanket.
So they should know, I hope they will find the main thing is not to panic, because now I don't know what to do, I'm ready to go and search for myself, but they won't let me go to Donetsk, there's heavy fighting there now, and I don't know how the search will turn out, it's hard
So the last words I heard from him were that I am a worker and it is good that I took my sisters and brothers and that they are safe
I have to hold on, children are what keeps me going, they are my hope and support, I have nothing but them for me, they are everything, I am happy that I have them
My whole body is numb, I don't feel anything good at all, even though I can walk, this has never happened to me
So thank you, I can't go there today, another time I need to calm down and gather my thoughts

How football teams from Ukraine and Russia fought in Turkey
31 minute(s) ago
Photo author, FC MINAY
Photo Caption,
FC "Minai" claims that this is a fresh photo from the last training sessions, already after the fight with the Russians
In Antalya, Turkey, a conflict took place at a meeting between the players of the Ukrainian football club "Minai" from the Premier League and the Russian "Shynyk".
The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams happened to be staying.
Initially, Ukrainian and Russian mass media wrote about the conflict that occurred on February 13.
Then both clubs confirmed the fight.
According to the official statement of FC "Minay", the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
Apparently, one of them was drunk and was clinging to a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight did take place, but already on the floor where the Russians stopped, and in equal formations.
The number of victims on the part of "Shinnyk" only confirms the fact that the Russians also "throw" their own, - the statement says.
The club claims that even after the fight ended, the Russians continued fighting among themselves, and the local police had to intervene.
"Before the start of the meetings, the main demand of FC "Minai" to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel has agreed to accommodate "Shynyk", the statement reads.
Football journalist Roman Bebeh, who was one of the first to report on the situation on Twitter, posted a photo of the Ukrainian player who defended the employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Baza telegram channel writes that the representatives of "Minaya" approached the players of "Shinnyk" from Yaroslavl and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian national anthem.
The Ukrainians denied it.
"The numerical advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our boy.
The people of Yaroslavl interceded for him and defended him.
There were five or six of us, there were much more Ukrainians," a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"The Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, among the injuries are a dissection of the lip, a broken toe and a suspected bruised ribs," writes "Kommersant".
"I don't understand how Ukrainians could get into the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine," said the general director of "Shynnyk" Serhiy Kulakov in a comment to journalists.
Subsequently, Kulakov told the Russian agency "RIA Novosti" that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but emphasized that they were not evicted, they decided to leave on their own.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And why are there medicines for diabetics
7 minute(s) ago
Injections, which are gaining popularity, help to lose up to 15% of weight, but have many side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy weight loss injections, which are used by some famous people, in particular, Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in type 2 diabetes.
Its use was admitted by Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience in social networks.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other type 2 diabetes medications can actually help with weight loss.
By affecting specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, a person feels less hungry, gets full faster and consumes fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick fix or a miracle drug that helps you lose weight without any effort.
Treatment takes place under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and physical activity.
Like all medicines, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or upset stomach, bloating and gas.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to loss of facial fat and, in some people, to sagging cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
Doctors called this effect "Ozempik face", after the name of another drug for the treatment of diabetes, which is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors advise taking Wegovy for no more than two years.
The Armed Forces regained some lost positions
4 hour(s) ago
Image credit: MARKO DJURICA Reuters
In some areas of the front, the Armed Forces managed to regain previously lost positions and gain a foothold there.
This was stated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhnyi during a conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhny, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk direction, where the Russians carry out up to 50 attacks every day.
Fierce battles continue in the area of Vugledar and Maryinka, where, according to Zaluzhny, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are reliably holding their defenses.
"Despite constant enemy pressure, we continue to keep Bakhmut under control and take measures to stabilize the front line around this city," Zaluzhny said.
In a conversation with General Milli, Zaluzhny shared his concern over Russia's use of maritime surface drones, which poses a threat to civilian shipping in the Black Sea.
After the capture of Soledar, Russian troops continue to tighten the ring around Bakhmut.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut is "developing successfully" for his troops.
On February 11, the evening briefing of the General Staff stated that Russia was strengthening its grouping of troops in the Lyman and Bakhmut areas.
On the evening of February 10 and on the night of February 11, the Russians attacked the critical infrastructure of Ukraine in several regions.
As reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from six o'clock in the evening on Friday until midnight, Ukrainian air defenses destroyed two dozen "Shaheed" missiles launched by the Russians from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile attack on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

The EU will strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
The European Union will introduce new sanctions against the Russian Federation on the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced this while speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of an emergency EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU will support Ukraine "as long as it is necessary."
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kyiv with the greatest financial support.
"In the supply of weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone in continental Europe," he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized "public auctions under the motto: battle tanks, submarines, airplanes - who will demand even more."
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda will benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Scholz: NATO should not become one of the parties to the conflict
In addition, the German chancellor once again emphasized that, despite all the help provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not become one of the parties in the military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue closely coordinating the supply of weapons to Kyiv with partners.
Scholz recalled the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022, about support on the way to European integration.
At the upcoming extraordinary summit, the EU countries intend to confirm their commitment to Ukraine's European path, he emphasized.
Ukraine belongs to Europe, and its future lies within the European Union, the Chancellor added.
The extraordinary summit of the European Union will be held on February 9-10 in Brussels.
One of the main topics will be Russia's war against Ukraine.
According to Reuters, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi will take part in the summit of EU leaders.

Metzola called for fighter jets and long-range weapons to be given to Kyiv - DW - 09.02.2023
The President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, during the meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke, called to provide Ukraine with aircraft and long-range weapons.
"EU member states must quickly consider, as a next step, providing the long-range systems and fighter jets you need to protect the freedom that so many take for granted," Metzola said.
According to her, the response must be proportionate to the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union," she said, addressing Zelenskyi.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow the Russian Federation to destroy the European way of life
Zelensky, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on the way to EU membership.
"We are getting closer to the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
A winning Ukraine is a winning member of the European Union," Zelenskyi said in his speech to the MEPs.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, defends itself against "the most anti-European force in the modern world."
"They are trying to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life with a total war.
But for what?
To destroy the European way as such after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of all 27 elements of the European way of life, 27 countries of the European Union.
We will not allow this," the President of Ukraine emphasized.
Zelensky will ask to speed up the delivery of weapons
The day before, DW reported that Zelenskyi arrived in Brussels to get the support of the European Council and speed up the delivery of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As the publication's source from Zelensky's advanced diplomatic team recalled, during Zelensky's visit to the United States at the end of December last year, Kyiv received "an agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support voted for by Congress."
"That's why the president of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally goes to other capitals," the interlocutor said.
At the same time, the diplomat noted that, "of course, such decisions are not the business of the European Council, but the decisions of the member states."
It is expected that Zelensky will announce Ukraine's needs for weapons during the Eurocouncil summit and will speak personally with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member states.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine primarily needs long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia launched a major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the west of the region has increased significantly over the past week, according to a February 8 analyst report.
It is also noted there that geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed Russian offensive successes in the Dvorichny area northwest of Svatovo.
The Armed Forces do not allow the Russian Federation to achieve significant success
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three major Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces are still preventing Russian forces from making significant progress.
In ISW, it is assumed that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full momentum, the Russian command has not yet activated parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after being deployed in Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in Luhansk region now have the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces set the terms of battle, ending the period of Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final culmination on the Svatov-Kreminna line without achieving the objectives regarding the seizure of the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions," the report says.
Analysts predict that this culmination is likely to create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces to use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning briefing, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine announced that the Russian troops, trying to take full control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive operations in five directions: Kupyansky, Lymansky, Bakhmutsky, Avdiivskyi and Novopavlivskyi in Kreminnaya, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytny, Maryinka and Vugledar districts.

The day before, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov suggested that the new offensive of Russia, which is predicted in February, may take place not only in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but also in other directions.
"Attempts to attack both in the Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia directions, of course, will happen," he said in an interview with Reuters.
"How successful they will be will depend on us."

SpaceX limited the ability of the Armed Forces to control drones via Starlink - DW - 02/09/2023
On Thursday, February 9, the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Mykhailo Podolyak, called on the American company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kyiv in the war started by Russia.
In this way, he reacted to the information that Elon Musk's company limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
"Companies have to decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to free life and of Ukraine - and then they do not invent how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its "right" to kill, seize territories," Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink is not supposed to be a weapon
The day before, the chief operating officer of SpaceX, Gwynn Shotwell, said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army is actively using to counter Russian aggression, "was never intended to be used as a weapon."
"However, the Ukrainians use it in an unforeseen way, which is not part of any agreement.
We know that the military uses it for communication, and that's fine.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes," Reuters quoted the director as saying.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could "limit their ability to do that."
"There is something we can do and have already done," she added.
She refused to specify exactly what measures the company had taken.
SpaceX "bargained" with the US Ministry of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX gave Kiev free Starlink systems to provide the population with Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue financing Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over the issue.
At the time, it estimated the necessary funding by the end of 2022 at $120 million, and during the next 12 months at about $400 million.
The issue of financing was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, and in the European Union, but soon the owner of the company, Musk, said that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US Department of Defense to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing like waves - DW - 09.02.2023
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, believes that the relations between Berlin and Kyiv against the background of Russian aggression are developing "wave-like" - they have "ups and downs".
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
"By nature, I am a fast person.
Others act more slowly, which may also be related to their bureaucracy," Zelenskyi said, adding that Ukraine does not have weeks or months at war, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every moment.
Revival of air defense
The President of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage the "conservative attitude" of Germany changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then, finally, I received support from Steinmeier (President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I previously had difficulties, especially due to the so-called "Steinmeier formula", - noted Zelensky .
He emphasized that "good work" had been carried out, which made it possible to change relations.
"We received IRIS-T air defense systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives," the President of Ukraine said.
According to Zelenskyi, Berlin managed to increase the pace of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T complexes to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate surrounding the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kyiv has returned relations with Germany "to a difficult phase," the president of Ukraine noted.
He called the discussions on this issue "emotional and difficult".
"I have to force him (Sholts - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is not needed by us, but by the Europeans," Zelenskyy explained.
Categorical about fighters
After the allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kiev with battle tanks, discussions began about the transfer of fighter jets, which Ukraine insists on.
Here Scholz took a categorical position: Germany will not transfer combat aircraft under any circumstances.
At the same time, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv "as long as it is necessary."
He made relevant statements after the meeting with Zelenskyi and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of the leaders of the European Union on Thursday.
Leopard 2 tanks for the Armed Forces: why are they so important
a new prime minister has already been nominated - DW - 10.02.2023
The government of Moldova resigned together with Prime Minister Natalia Havrylitsa.
This decision was made after consultations with the country's president, Maya Sandu, Havrylytsia reported on Friday, February 10.
"After a year and a half of working in the government, it is time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and implemented a policy of development, fight against corruption and integration into the European Union," she said.
According to her, the government "faced energy blackmail" during its work.
"They thought that we would give up and act like previous governments that betrayed national interests, but it was not like that. We worked in a continuous crisis mode," Havrylytsia emphasized.
She did not specify the reasons for the decision to resign, referring only to the lack of "support and trust at home."
Sandu thanked the prime minister "for her huge sacrifice and efforts", also noting that Havrylytsia headed the government in a period of crisis.
"Despite unprecedented challenges, the country was managed responsibly, with great attention and dedicated work.
We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and bankruptcy," the president of Moldova said.

The secretary of the Security Council can become the new prime minister
According to the law, the cabinet will continue to perform its duties until the new government is sworn in.
Sandu has already proposed her security advisor, the current secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and the former minister of internal affairs, Dorin Recana, as a replacement for Havrilica Sandu.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, in which the "Action and Solidarity" party has a majority.
Havrylytsia was her representative, so voting for Rechan should not be a problematic issue, the AFP agency notes.
Rechan has already stated that he plans to continue to seek Moldova's membership in the European Union.
According to him, the priorities of the new government will be "order and discipline, breathing new life into the economy, as well as peace and stability," writes Reuters.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.
The country twice experienced a complete blackout of electricity throughout the country as a result of strikes by the Russian Federation on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly limited gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to completely stop them.
Kishinev called the reduction in the volume of supplies a political decision not related to payment issues.

Why are aftershocks dangerous?
Despite the fact that, due to sub-zero temperatures in the region, the hope of saving people is becoming less and less, rescue operations continue.
Thus, 102 hours after the earthquake in the south of Turkey, a family of six people was freed from the rubble, reports the state news agency Anadolu.
A total of 166,000 Turkish and foreign rescuers, police officers, medics and volunteers are involved in the rescue work.
Of them, more than eight thousand rescuers - from 61 countries.
A total of 97 countries have sent aid to Turkey, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported.
The "White Helmets" in Syria criticize the UN for the lack of aid

In Turkey, almost 171,000 tents have been destroyed in the region affected by the earthquake.
According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets were sent to the disaster site.
At the same time, in Syria, representatives of the non-governmental organization "White Helmets", which carry out a rescue mission in regions controlled by rebels, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a representative of the "White Helmets" said that only two small international teams of volunteers who did not have rescue equipment had arrived in the region to provide assistance.
In addition, according to him, no humanitarian aid from the UN arrives in the region.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which works in London and reports on events in the rebel-held northern regions of Syria, noted that one batch of aid from the United Nations had arrived in the region the day before, but it lacked shelter tents and equipment for debriefing collapsed
About three thousand volunteers of the "White Helmets" are involved in the rescue work in the north of Syria.
According to their data, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people were found, more than 3.3 thousand people are considered dead.
More than 10,000 were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
In the early morning of February 6, a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 occurred in the southeast of Turkey, as well as in the north of Syria.
This earthquake became the most powerful in almost a century of observations.
The last time Turkey experienced underground tremors of such force was in 1939, when about 33,000 people died.
In less than 12 hours, southeast Turkey was rocked by a second powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

The decisive round of presidential elections is taking place in Cyprus - DW - 12.02.2023
In the Republic of Cyprus, on Sunday, February 12, the second, decisive round of presidential elections is held.
The ex-minister of foreign affairs of the country, Nikos Christodoulidis, and the former permanent representative of Cyprus to the UN, Andreas Mavroyanis, came to him.
Conservative politician Christodoulidis received 32 percent of the vote in the first round, his opponent in the second round, Mavroyaninis, who is supported by left forces, won 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling party "Democratic Union" (DISY) Averof Neofita.
The DISY party, after the defeat of its candidate in the first round, could not decide who to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, the AFP agency notes.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal suffrage.
He forms and heads the country's government.
The winner of the current election will hold the position of head of state for five years and will become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was split in two in 1974 by a coup supported by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the northern sector of the island occupied by the Turks declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Ankara.
The most recent talks on the attempted reunification of Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots - about 560,000 people - take part in the elections.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote for them.

"Energoatom" announced a new threat to the ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
Petro Kotin, president of Energoatom NAEC, called the Russians' reduction of water in the Kakhov reservoir a new threat to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZANP).
"There are many threats to the ZNPP.
The decrease of water in the Kakhov reservoir is a new added threat," Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the level of the reservoir is 13.8 meters against the normal level of 16 meters, "so that the station receives power for its generators, for turbine capacitors and for safety systems."
"In recent days, we can see that the level has stabilized and is rising a little, because it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m," Kotin is quoted as saying by Interfax-Ukraine.
He explained that the Russians, who control the locks at the Kakhovskaya HPP, began to release less water, while at the same time the inflow at the top of the Dnipro increased.
The president of "Energoatom" clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at the ZNPP is sufficiently full and there is enough water for now, but in case the level of the reservoir drops to a critical point, this, according to him, "will be a big problem for the ZNPP."
Kotin emphasized that the critical level will be 12 meters, the emergency level - 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will prevent a critical situation.

Israel to step up campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12/02/2023
Israel plans to step up its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, February 12.
"The government is meeting today to prepare for an even broader response to those who commit terrorism," Netanyahu was quoted as saying by Reuters.
The statement followed a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
Police shot and killed the man at the scene, and arrested and questioned family members of the Palestinian.
Israeli law enforcement officers sealed the doors and windows of the house of the Palestinian's family.
The next step after sealing may be the demolition of the attacker's house, AR writes.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot dead during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired a rocket towards the Israeli border on Saturday evening.
The Israeli army said that the missile was intercepted, reports dpa.
Read also: The second attack in two days in Jerusalem: a 13-year-old boy injured two people
The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army conducts almost daily raids on the West Bank, which has led to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported killed during them or during their own attacks.
In addition, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman died as a result of Palestinian attacks in 2023.
About 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022, according to human rights activists, making it the deadliest year in the territories since 2004.
At the same time, over the past year, 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis, AR writes.
Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, dpa notes.

the head of the Greek Foreign Ministry visited Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - perennial opponents, dpa writes on Sunday, February 12.
On the same day, the heads of foreign affairs of the two countries, Nikos Dendias and Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu, held an unexpected meeting, during which, according to Greek television cameras, they even hugged.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
√áavu≈üoƒülu thanked Dendias for Greece becoming one of the first countries to provide immediate aid to Turkey after the natural disaster.
He added that both states will try to start a dialogue again and solve their problems.
"Greece's assistance to the Turkish people does not end there," the head of the Greek Foreign Ministry emphasized.
According to him, Athens "will do everything" - at the bilateral level, as well as within the framework of the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit a disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the region of Antakya and Hatay.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
For several days now, political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing the hope that the assistance provided by Athens to Ankara could be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members already showed solidarity with each other during the severe earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This assistance, known as "earthquake diplomacy", helped to achieve some detente at the time.
Conflict over the islands
Athens and Ankara have been arguing over sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean for decades.
Ankara questions Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos and Kos.
Greece seems to be violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous landing craft on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
Read also: Are Greece and Turkey on the verge of an armed conflict?
Almost every day, Turkey reinforces its claims with the flight of fighter jets over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country's leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Warming of Ankara with Armenia
Against the background of the tragedy caused by the earthquakes, there is also a warming of relations between Turkey and Armenia.
Ankara has opened a crossing that has been closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia for those affected by natural disasters passed.
In addition, Armenia reported sending two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the February 6 earthquake that killed more than 33,000 people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are tense due to historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic murders in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War.
As the legal successor of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits that it exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide was condemned, in particular, by the USA, Germany and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the background of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation only became more complicated.

NATO is discussing further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of defense ministers of NATO countries has started in Brussels, within which a meeting in the so-called "Ramstein" format is also being held on Tuesday, February 14.
On the agenda of the event is the further increase of support for Ukraine in the war and the increase in the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting that NATO should provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war."
"We don't see any signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensives and new attacks," Reuters quoted him as saying.
"This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics," Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations on the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.

During the meeting, the ministers are expected to approve long-term methodological recommendations for the defense planning of the Alliance.
"Allies will discuss investments in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure," Interfax-Ukraine quoted Stoltenberg as saying.
What to expect from the ninth "Ramstein"
On this very day, the US-led Contact Group to discuss the urgent needs of Ukraine is meeting at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, in which the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksiy Reznikov, is taking part.
The head of the Ukrainian Defense Department will also participate in a special session of the meeting of NATO defense ministers.
"More than 50 member countries of the Contact Group are united with you in this fight for the sovereignty and self-defense of Ukraine," Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of the meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership previously expressed hope that at the next Ramstein meeting, the partners could decide on the provision of Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that, based on the results of this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of the provision of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants a ban on the tour of Russian artists in the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine collects data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations financed from the state budget of the Russian Federation, in order to include them in the new package of EU sanctions.
Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Halyna Hryhorenko informed about this in an interview with DW.
Culture as Russia's weapon
As Grigorenko emphasized, Russia uses culture to promote its aggressive militaristic policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage museum says very clearly that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation, Grigorenko says.
In her opinion, dialogue through culture with Russia is currently impossible.
That is why Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
For example, recently the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DNR" in Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour
However, according to Hryhorenko, this is not enough, and those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin's policy still manage to tour Europe.
"In order to officially cancel such tours, you need to have names on the European sanctions lists," Grigorenko says and adds: "We are working to ensure that Russian cultural figures who promote Russian narratives outside of Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts, on the territory of the EU."
According to Hryhorenko, the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group at the Office of the President of Ukraine deal with this issue in Ukraine.
As previously reported, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, at a joint press conference with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi in Brussels on February 9, noted that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at the summit in Kyiv.
She promised that many propagandists will be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctioned list of cultural and media figures of the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 surnames.

The USA is ready to sell HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment to Poland for $10 billion
The US State Department has approved the possible sale of military equipment and services to Poland in the amount of about 10 billion dollars.
This was reported by Voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin with reference to the Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
These are primarily launchers of the highly mobile M142 HIMARS artillery rocket system with ammunition for them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such an acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe," the Agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon statement, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and deter regional threats."
In general, Poland submitted a request for the purchase of the following equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of the HIMARS loader module;
- 45 army tactical missile systems M57 (ATACMS);
- 1,514 capsules of the GMLRS salvo guided missile system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
Also included in the agreement are missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, personnel training and equipping, system integration support, engineering and technical and logistics services for the US government and contractors, training, sensors, other related elements of hardware and software.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is an addition to the launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw also invited missile launchers from South Korea, the publication informs.
The Secretary General of NATO called on the USA to be ready for a long war with the Russian Federation in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine for protection in the war against the Russian Federation is not off the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"The first step in providing advanced aircraft is to have soldiers or airmen capable of operating them.
This is a process that takes some time.
We started this process today, - said Sunak about the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
"Nothing is off the agenda, and our leadership on this issue is something we should all be proud of."
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks would arrive in Ukraine "next month" and declared that Ukraine "must never again be vulnerable to attack" and called for "arming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term" ".
According to him, Great Britain has agreed to expand its training program, which has trained 10,000 military personnel over the past six months, and promised, as CNN writes, to "accelerate the delivery of our equipment" to ensure Ukraine's progress on the front line in the coming "days and weeks, not years."
During the press conference, President Zelenskyi expressed gratitude for Ukraine's support: "Today it is clear that we have the support of Great Britain.
Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity."
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he once again repeated the call to provide Western fighter jets to Ukraine and added that he "heard from Mr. Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighter jets" to Kyiv.
The Russian embassy in London has already announced that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military and political consequences" for the whole world.
Today, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kyiv continues to talk with Western partners about the possibility of providing fighter jets: "I spoke with Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra to coordinate our international steps as a full-scale Russian invasion approaches the one-year mark.
I thanked you for the last decision about the tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation."
Yuriy Ignat, the spokesman of the Air Force of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said in a comment for CNN that Ukraine will need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say that the West has a short period of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the start of the expected new Russian offensive in the spring or even in February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin is already trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since the beginning of January.

"Politics and profits" stand in the way of vaccination
The director-general of the World Health Organization said on Sunday that unless countries effectively use existing tools to fight the pandemic, it will not be possible to end it.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the necessary tools - effective healthcare and effective medical tools.
But the world has misused these tools," said Tedros, addressing participants from 100 countries around the world.
Obstacles to achieving the WHO's goal of vaccinating 40% of each country's population against the coronavirus are "politics and profits," the WHO chief said, "not production."
"Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue to COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Fund," Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaborative initiative created to equitably distribute the COVID vaccine.
Ghebreyesus also emphasized that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperation to protect other peoples.
Together!" - noted Gebreesus on the Twitter social network.
A WHO official also urged vaccine manufacturers to "prioritize and honor their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African Vaccine Acquisition Fund]" and become "much more transparent about what goes where."
AVAT is an initiative of the African Union to ensure access to vaccines against COVID-19 across Africa.
The official urged vaccine manufacturers to "share know-how, technology and licenses and give up intellectual property rights."
Previously, Karen Attia, a contributor to The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share the Moderna vaccine "recipe" with the world.
"The US administration has trumpeted the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, this is not benevolent philanthropy; it is supremacy.
Poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they asked for a fair opportunity from the beginning," the columnist noted.
"We are not asking for charity," Tedros said, "we are calling for smart investment in global recovery."
As "Voice of America" reported, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the abandonment of patent protection for vaccines against COVID-19.
Such a refusal should, according to the plan of the US administration, allow poorer countries to produce analogues of patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, etc. opposed it.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their vaccines against the coronavirus.
The Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center reported on Monday that it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, almost 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the decision to send F-16 aircraft to Ukraine will be a "very serious decision" that is "not easy to make."
This was stated by one of Ukraine's closest allies in an interview with the CNN television company against the background of discussions of new arms deliveries to Ukraine.
According to CNN's Laura K√ºnsberg, in Warsaw, in an exclusive interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, President Duda said that sending the F-16s would create a "serious problem" for Poland because the Polish Air Force has less than 50 planes, and the Poles themselves "do not have enough ... and we will need much more."
Duda also emphasized that fighter jets, like the F-16, have a "very serious need for maintenance," so "it's not enough to just send a few planes."
These remarks of President Duda were heard against the background of discussions of new supplies of weapons to Ukraine, including Western tanks and anti-missile systems of greater antiquity.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has been pushing its NATO allies to send Patriot missiles and Western-made tanks such as Germany's Leopard tanks to Kyiv.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi made an unannounced European tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with the means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelenskyy called combat aviation "wings of freedom" for Ukraine.
Zelensky repeated the same message in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to the members of the European Parliament, Zelenskyi said that he was "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hoped that the next negotiations on the provision of aviation to Ukraine would also be successful.
"I have heard from some European leaders that they are ready to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
Now I have a series of bilateral negotiations, we will raise the issue of fighters and other aviation.
That's why we continue our work here in Brussels," Zelenskyy said.
As "Voice of America" reported, last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to transfer its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said his government would consider Kyiv's request for the F-16.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied the delivery of F-16 aircraft from the US, but Western experts believe that these aircraft may come to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that previously the weapons that the USA refused to supply ended up in Ukraine if the European NATO allies agreed to hand them over.

Chisinau, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, the president of Moldova announced a conspiracy by Moscow to use foreign saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, transfer the country "at the disposal of Russia" and disrupt its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maia Sandu's briefing came a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country had intercepted plans by Russian special services to destroy Moldova, which Moldovan intelligence officials later confirmed.
"The plan for the next period involves the involvement of saboteurs with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will resort to violent actions, attack some government buildings and even take hostages," Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The goal of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate government of Chisinau to an illegitimate one," Sandu said, "which would put our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration."
She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed."
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought to forge closer ties with its Western partners.
In June last year, it received the status of a candidate for the European Union, on the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several cases of organized criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence."
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a NATO member, has faced a number of problems.
These include a serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply cut gas supplies; rapid inflation; as well as several incidents in recent months involving missiles that have crossed its airspace and debris that has been found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said that Russia wanted to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the intelligence services contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry into Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that government institutions are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control," Sandu said.
She said Moldova's parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service as well as the prosecutor's office "with the necessary tools to more effectively deal with risks to the country's security."
The president added that the plan would "rely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups," and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Volodymyr Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.
The United States and Great Britain imposed sanctions against both men last year.
Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shor party also rocked Moldova amid an energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday took place after the Prime Minister of Moldova, Natalia Gavrilita, resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Rechan, as Gavrilita's successor.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, US State Department Deputy Spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova for years, often involving the use of corruption as a weapon to achieve its goals. goals".

We won't be this week.
Maybe on Friday. THE DOCTOR ASKED TO BE HOME AND TREAT Daria's EAR.
I would like to talk to you personally, but we are at home.
Darynka's ear hurts, so we went to the hospital today. So we will be treated until Thursday.
How are you?
I thought, if you need help, for example, I know the kindergartens will be on vacation from next week, stay with Nikita, if you are busy, then you could stay with Daruseya and Vanya for a while.
Stories from the war: "Grandma with a red flag" threw him away when she found out about Bucha
An employee of the Center for Strategic Communications found the same woman.
üîª A living symbol of "pro-Russian Ukraine", a woman who, according to the version of Russian propaganda, "bravely opposed the nationalists", is actually grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only support her with products, but also protected her from the anger of ordinary Kharkiv residents.
üîª Anna Ivanovna explains that she went out with a red flag to, as she thought, the Russian military, so that they "wouldn't destroy Ukraine."
And in the aggressor country, her motives were twisted, because of which she now feels like a "traitor."
üîª She is currently in one of the Kharkiv city hospitals together with her husband.
üí¨ The military is urged not to disrespect the old woman.
"Now, when Anna Ivanivna received a mine in her yard from the Russians, and help from the Ukrainians, her grandson is saving himself in Poland, when she found out about Bucha and everything else, she threw that red flag away," says the platoon commander from the pseudo "Cadet ¬ª
The enemy is creating the conditions for an offensive on Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih - an assembly
The Russian military is conducting combat operations to reach the administrative borders of the Kherson region and create favorable conditions for the offensive on the cities of Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih.

Literally: "To increase the pace of the offensive operation, the command of the armed forces of the Russian Federation continues to take measures to strengthen the strike potential of its troops.
Weapons and military equipment removed from storage in the Western, Central, and Eastern military districts and the Northern Fleet are transferred to the regions bordering Ukraine by rail.
Details: The enemy did not conduct active operations in the Volyn and Poliske directions.
There were no significant changes in the situation in the specified directions.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
There is still a threat of the enemy launching missile strikes on military and civilian infrastructure throughout the territory of Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as provocations by the enemy on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine.
We abandon Soviet weapons and switch to NATO models - Zaluzhny
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhnyi held a telephone conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO-style weapons.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces
Zaluzhnyi's direct speech: "We also discussed the perspective model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with my American colleague.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will finish it.
I also informed General Milli about the difficult situation in the east of our country, in particular in the Izyum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite all the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, hold occupied lines and positions."
"Whoever came up with this hellish summer was clearly out of his mind!" - complained Dykorosla and stretched out her hands in front of her, as if she wanted to reach for the ghostly coolness.
"You say the same thing every time," Varta remarked indifferently, stirring the ice in the cocktail. - In autumn - because it rains and fogs, the grass rots.
In winter - because it is cold and the potion freezes.
In the spring - because it's raining again...
"I would sit in my Carpathians," Varta shrugged her shoulders indifferently.
Although she didn't particularly like the city either.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and bustle.
The girl liked to imagine the familiar streets calm, quiet and greener, like a hundred years ago or even earlier.
But there is no such magic that would allow you to return to the past.
- Pah!
You say that! - The wild plant slapped her palm on the table - and vases with flowers timidly turned green. - You would sit in captivity for a week at my grandmother Rutmera's house with her friends, you would pray for every passing truck to take you away from there to any city.
Unless you loved to weed the beds from morning till night, pick herbs, hang them under the ceiling and at the same time sing old chants.
Because the dragonfly rested her horn on the fact that without words, none of my potions would be as they should be.
And wait, I haven't mentioned yet the selection of all kinds of junk at night!..
But where is there, our white hand, you would have died, not even a week would have passed!
Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, and that they like this kind of "job", that it is their conscious choice and so on.
But if you start to really understand this topic, it becomes scary...
Currently, the problem of involvement of Ukrainian women in prostitution is particularly acute.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea of legalizing prostitution... because of that I didn't treat him very well.
I think that it is necessary to adopt the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of "Swedish model".
At the same time, they do not order the woman, but the client.
Women are helped to get out of this "business" and to make it legal.
Legalization does not mean safety and social guarantees at all.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything else.
Men should also think about what they are buying - "pleasure" or violence...
There is a need for something else... you can show me the nearest optician with a doctor to write a prescription for glasses.
And you need to buy a quality frame... I looked at some sites with frames, and I was pleasantly surprised - it's cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about 300 dollars for them, the frame was of an average level (or even lower).
I don't know what kind of frames are in stores, but the prices in online stores are quite normal.
But as for some cosmetics, I can definitely say that it is more expensive here.
Much more.
Multifocal lenses in our glasses are very expensive (compared to our average wages).
Considering our family's budget (especially the fact that we have to rent housing), $300 for glasses is quite a high amount.
Did the doctors not offer you an artificial multifocal lens?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then I became allergic to the lenses, another year after that I wore hard lenses, I developed a severe allergy to almost all cosmetics.
I have been wearing glasses for 4 years now, I rarely wear contact lenses.
Yes, I also read that covid affects vision.
Also, after 40 years there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than 1000 dollars, so very very expensive.
Yes, glasses are fashionable now.
I asked one doctor why he doesn't wear lenses or get laser correction, so he answered that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of UAH 1,500, this amount is unreal
My glasses now mask wrinkles
So.
My mother has little work experience.
She didn't work much: first, small children who often get sick, then she took care of her grandmother... so the state gave her a minimum pension.
Father receives 3,800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8,000 hryvnias, and all these funds had to be paid for housing rent.
In good times (before covid) there were premiums, but with the onset of quarantine there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
That is why many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for their family or to buy a passport, but then they lose contact with their family...
Yes, there are advantages.
But when my husband has a day off, he goes to the apiary)
good night
According to the order from the day of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until the restoration of control over the specified seaports.
It is indicated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the impossibility of servicing ships and passengers, ensuring the appropriate level of shipping safety and environmental protection during Russia's military operations in these regions, which pose a threat to people's lives and health.
the Russian Federation uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
As reported by the correspondent of Ukrinform, Reuters writes about this, referring to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Great Britain.
"The British Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including Great Britain and South Africa, on social networks," the article says.
It is noted that these conclusions were reached by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the basis of an expert study.
"The department said that this study revealed exactly how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign works, aimed at manipulating international public opinion regarding the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers," writes Reuters.
According to the study, the troll factory "used Telegram to recruit and coordinate new supporters, who subsequently took action against Kremlin critics, pelting them with comments in support of President Putin and his war."
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
"Traces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including: Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok," the report says.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in this regard that her government has already "warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations."
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadowy troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war," Trus concluded.
Ivanna, I will explain to you now.
You have such a hair structure that all hair is almost the same length.
Very few short layers.
In order to achieve the smoothest possible result, you need to do hair filing.
But this will greatly affect the thickness of the hair.
That's why I didn't do it.
Or dye the roots to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I also did not dye the roots.
Therefore, the transition can be a bit abrupt.
I can fuse the transition for you, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be dyed to match your color, so when your hair grows back you won't notice the difference.
Regarding the quality of the hair.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
Hair may become drier, this is normal because it is blonde.
It is impossible to make such a blonde without losing quality.
If you do proper hair care, the condition of the hair will return to normal.
Please write what Matrix care you use.
Maybe he's weak for a blonde.
We can book you a free tinting session to make the transition smoother.
In this photo, the transition is also quite sharp.
Because a large percentage of blond hair is in the root zone.
Write, please, when you would be able to drive up, so that I could look.
If we do tinting, it will take about three hours.
There is a lot of positivity from what I do at my job.
I help people - this is the most important thing and I wanted it.
Let it be in this way, but this is help to people to whom almost no one in the world helps and will not say "good day" with a smile from the heart.
I found excellent basic lessons for learning the Czech language on the Internet today.
Here in the morning I clean the rooms where the homeless sleep, at this time I am alone and the doors to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons with headphones and repeat them after the lecturer.
On the side, I talk to myself, but it's good that at this time no one sees or hears me üòÖ I think I can learn the language for an hour a day.
So another huge positive of this job is learning the language in headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ
Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
Its longest period of peace lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
At one time, most of the modern territory of Russia was occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural background of Russians.
The cult of invasion and raiding was successful throughout the history of Russia: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then - 20 years of Putin's regime.
These cultural features have shaped state institutions that cultivate the politics of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of wars of aggression because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other countries.
Russians have not yet fully felt the consequences of economic sanctions.
Their standard of living did not deteriorate enough to provoke mass protest movements within the Russian Federation.
So demand stronger sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia poses the threat of a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military is shelling and seizing nuclear power plants on the territory of Ukraine.
Chornobyl nuclear power plant was de-energized.
They fired from tanks and took control of the Zaporizhzhia NPP - the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also detected over the South Ukrainian NPP in the Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacking nuclear power plants.
A missile strike, overheating of a reactor or spent fuel due to disruptions in electricity and water supplies can lead to radiation leaks.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia does not need to press the "red button" to cause a catastrophe of a planetary scale.
Support Ukraine - the Russian threat can only be overcome together!
The Russians rob Ukrainian farmers and illegally export grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and the first harvests from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a deliberate policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory decided to "expropriate the surplus of last year's and this year's crops" from the south of Ukraine.
The occupying authorities take away seed from the farmers, but at the same time require them to successfully sow in order to send new crops to Russia.
Forbids paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, he threatens physical violence.
Russia repeats the USSR's policy of mass looting of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
This is how the Holodomor began in 1932-33 and private property on Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of a "liberation war against the Nazis", Russia in particular provokes famine in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor on the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country refuse any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine take children hostage.
They force their mothers to spy on the locations of the Ukrainian military, and if they refuse, they threaten to kill their children.
People are pushed to make a hard choice: lose their children or become traitors to the Motherland and suffer the punishment for it.
Lyudmila Denisova, the Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine, has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphaned children by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated an amendment to the legislation "to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbas."
Call on your authorities and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don't like their indecision.
Because NATO does not close the sky over Ukraine, thousands die.
More than 50,000 civilians have already been killed.
However, we would be powerless without Western weapons, but I have to say that they are coming in insufficient quantities and late.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for our future.
I think that this is beneficial for the alliance itself, because with weapons from NATO and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe
Did you know that a Ukrainian invented how to reload a "disposable" nlaw anti-tank complex?
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage
The Russians deserve the worst and most cruel thing that can be imagined.
So to some extent I am happy with what is happening.
Because this war has not been going on for 4 months, it started around the 15th century, I can't remember exactly now.
But all these hundreds of years there is an attempt to make us their slaves.
No sooner does one generation die than another is born and takes up the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have returned to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state
In general, it is wild for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But due to the rapidity of events, I didn't even have time to think through, to reflect on the very fact that the war is going on and what it means for me
It's great here, but I need to learn the language and go to work. I won't be able to sit on the Czech state's maintenance, but the problem is that my husband does not want me to have constant quarrels at work. And I will have to return to Ukraine, and we could stay, but he is all will do for us to go back. very difficult situation
He doesn't want us to live here, that's his answer
Yes, he is glad that we are here, but in order for us to sit at home all the time, I myself took the children to school and swimming, I ask that we stay here after the war, and he says that we will go home immediately, he will not make us documents
I probably won't be able to leave by myself if he has a long time to do, and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic
Prolonged beating
I want to learn to be a hairdresser when the war is over, and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic. If he doesn't want to, then I'll probably have to go to a lawyer. It's too early to do anything now. But he clearly told us that after the war, we're going home right away.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine he said that he would))) well, now I know the truth
Yes, thank you. We will get out of the situation, the main thing is that the war ends!!! everything will be fine.!!!
No, at the moment he doesn't have anyone, that's for sure. I think the reason is that children in the Czech Republic want a lot of things, they ask him for toys or to go to McDonald's, they shout, they run around the house. And he is used to the peace of no one he doesn't bother and doesn't ask for anything lower. But we came here and everything annoys him and we have to spend money on us, and he is very thrifty. So it's better for him that we live in Ukraine.
Outside the window of the train, majorillas, sprinkled with small gray rain, birch and fir trees, sprinkled with black and white confetti of magpies, grieving water carriers and freight cars.
Comrade Operative Orlrv was lying on a narrow Spartan bed, familiar to him, because it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed at home.
He unwrapped a simple set of errands - rye bread and lard wrapped in a gray cloth.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and he was unpretentious in life, he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simply, because he did only what was useful for the country and the world revolution.
Then he bent over the old, reddened suitcase and carefully took out with two palms the crystal dome that glinted dimly in the gray light of the middle lane.
- What do you have, comrade? - asked the young cadet, his neighbor, in fright.
- A rarity, - Comrade Orlov said with a tenderness unexpected for himself, securely placing the skull on the compartment table, - such a thing... A very interesting and fiery thing.
This, you can say, is my friend...
Yes, I look at work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately, I find a job for men, for special education.
I don't speak Czech, I'm a teacher of young children, I'm not an engineer and I don't have a driver's license.
And finding housing is also a big issue.
It's my first time abroad and I just don't know what to do and how to act.
I haven't been able to find a job for a month, I just cleaned one house.
I understand that the situation in Prague is very difficult, so I don't even go there
Here I have problems anywhere üò≠ I'm abroad for the first time, I don't know the language and I'm all alone.
I and 20 other people were fired by the agency after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find a job anymore.
I ask people, look at websites - nothing
I attend a course in this village.
One lesson per week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, now the situation is such that I have to hold on to free housing while it is available.
And watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options ((
I don't want to just sit there because housing won't be free for long.
I understand
I don't want to take money from you.
I don't want thoughts about lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in an ordinary city, not in the capital.
A difficult road from Ukraine for three days and a big city where a foreign language scared me a lot.
I did not come here to visit cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save life.
I just need a job and a room.
Maybe you know someone in a small town?
I can look after the children, cook, clean, work in the garden...
I know how to sew, I have learned how to sew on a sewing machine.
I made bed linen and some clothes to order.
Maybe there will be such a job.
I can do it!
Hugs and greetings to everyone!! üôèüèªü§óü§óü§óüíêüåû
I am very glad to read you!
We now have an air alarm again (((
Today more than 100 rockets arrived in Ukraine üò°
I worked with the wounded today, so it was difficult to concentrate.
All thoughts were about the child.
Jan studied at home...
Everything will be Ukraine!
We submit this evil!
My colleagues and I volunteer in the surgical department
Sometimes it covers, of course))))
Then I clean, cook, chat))))
Because this is my home, my land!
Congratulate everyone - everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! üôèüèªüíêü§ó
Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the issue of withdrawing or not withdrawing the association of Russian psychologists from European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is the main thing.
I will give an analogy.
If one child takes a toy from another child in the sandbox, most likely the adults watching the children will try to reconcile the children and after some time the game will continue.
If one child in the sandbox begins to hit another in the face with a shovel, then such a child will be isolated for a long time, and no one will play with him.
I also liked the analogy of a Russian psychologist colleague about the fact that when someone from a neighboring apartment kills someone, the whole apartment building is not put in jail.
Among Ukrainian psychologists, there are many discussions on the topic of excluding Russian associations from European ones.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to work with several psychologists from Russia that I know and share knowledge in order to heal the trauma of clients from both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and I have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who at their level are trying to do many things for the development of universal human values in Russia.
Therefore, I am definitely in favor of a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia 5-10% of the population supports the war, and other figures in opinion polls are exaggerated by propaganda.
My wife left her native Ukraine because there is a war going on there.
The wife had a good job and no matter the war, she never left her home.
In order not to sit on the neck of my wife in the Czech Republic, I am trying to earn money, because once in 2009, I received a certificate of completion of masseuse courses in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money as they can.
Now the only problem is to learn the Czech language.
My wife teaches and works and earns for herself and the child for food, for kindergarten, for a bus ticket, for mobile communication services, for clothes.
And at this time I am defending my Motherland.
Thanks for the support people who understand this.
Thank you to the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine in difficult times. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáøü§ù‚úä
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to advertise my wife's massage services in your community.
The wife earns money on her own because she does not want to live on the taxes of the Czech people.
thank you
Thank you very much.
It really helps my wife to earn money for her family.
OK, I'll pass it on to my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of the Ukrainian people.
Some people laugh at my wife's announcement, but my wife offers her services.
My wife in Ukraine was a nurse, I work in the police, but the war separated us.
It is good that my wife wants to work and earn money and not wait for help from your republic.

Supervision of students during lessons, breaks and school events by school employees.
Safety conditions during a stay in the gym, on the playground and in professional classes
Distance learning rules
If this is impossible due to the introduction of an emergency measure or the introduction of quarantine
personal presence of students at school, the school provides distance education to interested students.
If the distance learning method is ordered by the school (class), students are obliged to do it in this way.
The most important safety rules
In particular, it is forbidden to bring items that endanger health and safety to school and school events
weapons (including knives), drugs (drugs), cigarettes and alcohol.
It is forbidden to smoke and use alcohol or other drugs in school and at school events.
I really need a person who could act as a translator in a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we are dealing with the insurance company to fix the car.
Strakhova invited a person who can translate from Czech to Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa during the technical inspection of the car.
Could you please help me with the translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific work based on statistical analysis of body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a separate population.
In addition, I also have work experience in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in research at the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped monitor bat populations in the Kharkiv region, as well as organize wintering for bats that were disturbed by people in the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation, which is important to me.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to familiarize myself with scientific works on tardigrades, observe their life activities under a microscope, and talk with scientists who study them.
So the option of a more in-depth study of these and other microscopic organisms is also of interest to me.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees - analysis from an expert
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive aid for refugees from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milo≈° Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken upon itself the solution of many problems.
She provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
Approximately 500,000 people arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors - Poland and the Czech Republic - and will tirelessly thank you!
How Poland is coping with the unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden, ProUkrainu editors asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analytics, which has a representative office not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians, and this had a significant impact on the daily life of the Czechs.
In labor governments, there are long queues, a significant increase in prices in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government was extremely quick to organize and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.
It was foreseen.
In Poland, they have been saying for the past months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine there was less preparation for what would happen, while in Poland they were actively preparing.
So, for example, in the border regions of Poland and Ukraine, even before the start of the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.
In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.
I heard that they laughed about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very well thought out: to prepare for all these events even before the start of the war.
I would like to note that extremely large funds were allocated from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombings and the Russian aggressor.
First of all, help in logistics - movement on the territory of Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains for the wounded and sick.
These are planes that move between cities in Poland, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I had the experience of cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as some might think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
Tolls for Ukrainians have been canceled in Poland.
They can ride trains and public transport for free.
In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to travel for free to the places where they plan to stay.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local self-government bodies.
For the most part, these are closed small school stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
Free food and free medical first aid are organized there.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
The big cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw became very active, where whole Ukrainian quarters have now been created.
The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they managed to take away from the Russian embassy objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes stood in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone in there.
Polish local authorities nationalized it, let's say.
It was taken for the benefit of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
Water and electricity will be supplied there, they are insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm adopted and the Senate approved the law on refugees from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to stay legally in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private fund that allocated ten million zlotys for free medical assistance to Ukrainians.
You only need to write an SMS and get the code on your phone.
And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, you can get medicine for free in Poland.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which is irrevocably provided to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.
There are various funds, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which provide packages with food, chemicals, and clothes.
As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".
That is, "an event that has no analogues."
Such a huge openness.
For the Polish state, these are huge expenses.
To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely large blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
Language problem.
Questions start with polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot help themselves without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems, diseases.
The second problem is schools, where students, especially in the upper grades, are also at a loss at the beginning, unable to understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
The children have the knowledge not only to speak English well, but in general their level is higher than the class they enter.
This is also interesting.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, or lawyer in Ukraine, it is much more difficult to master this job here.
As a lawyer or an accountant, I do not know such cases at all.
Doctors now appear in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small polyclinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on a legal basis.
The language problem is often the reason that prompts families to return home after a few weeks of being here.
There are many such cases.
In the last few weeks we have had a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military operations.
Here they did not get used to it, did not find a job.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, it will be more convenient for them to return home.
This is also one of such problems that has arisen in recent weeks.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed
According to the ambassador of Ukraine, significant changes have taken place in the Czech Republic.
If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively migrant workers, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles feel about millions of Ukrainian refugees?
There is a similar situation in Poland.
Here, all television channels often quote the statement of the President of Poland, Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, who died tragically in Smolensk.
When the events of Russia's attack on Georgia took place, he was in Tbilisi together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state.
There he said the famous phrase that Russian aggression will certainly not stop at Georgia, and Ukraine may come next.
Then there may be the Baltic countries, it may even reach Poland.
That is, if he had foreseen it.
In fact, Ukrainians are currently protecting Poland with their blood, their loyalty, and their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Poles appreciate it properly, that is why they open their homes and help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.
The threat is seen in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.
Therefore, the attitude changed to a positive one.
The Ukrainian flag and the Ukrainian national anthem are now not the "song of nationalists" or some enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are still small groups among the population who have not changed their views, they exist in every country.
But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.
The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who must be eliminated.
In Poland, this is simply accepted with a laugh, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political undertones.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change of public opinion of those strata of society that still had doubts about some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
When the Poles start to think that there might be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives in the way that is happening now in Ukraine.
People from Mariupol, Buchi and other Ukrainian cities are constantly being talked about here.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.
Russia threatens to strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How are the Polish authorities and society reacting?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the USA and other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
Currently, Poland is undergoing additional recruitment into the Territorial Defense Forces.
That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
Citizens feel that the state is preparing for such events.
Among them is the recently adopted new law on the defense of the homeland, where the budget has been significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.
The requirements for the recruitment of the military have been changed, many points that are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.
Your predictions became a reality in Syria, you warned of an attack by Russia.
What do you say about the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world manage to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst case scenario.
As for a nuclear strike, I don't have much faith.
But there is such a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and for Poland as well.
It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.
Note, I wouldn't want that, but it's the worst case scenario.
A blow of low power, but all television channels would show this "mushroom".
To see it from Poland, the Baltic countries.
In this case, the Russians expect that NATO troops will flee and lose their combat capability.
Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, the problems of Putin's entourage, the oligarchs who are currently suffering from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.
We have the facts of the hydroelectric power station catching fire on Sakhalin, some evidence that people are beginning to resent the prices.
Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia will break up into 19 small countries.
We also have tendencies towards peaceful settlement of war.
Various countries of the European Union, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.
It will be delayed until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing the possible termination of gas supply.
This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did it affect Polish citizens?
Since I am an analyst, I predicted this.
I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.
My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there is a very large number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the increase in prices.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but the prices for all resources will definitely start to rise.
Various routes to certain alternative sources are now being sought.
In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very large port in Poland.
Regarding oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.
Currently, gas stations in Poland will be bought out by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe were to abandon Russian energy carriers, it would be the loss of a source of funding for the Russian Federation's military.
Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in the Polish media
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Polish mass media.
What do the Polish media say about it?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased greatly.
And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in the zone of military operations.
That is, the actions of the president are evaluated by politicians, analysts, and representatives of the authorities as very active.
They testify that the Ukrainian authorities are aiming as much as possible to receive military and financial aid in order to provide for the refugees leaving Ukraine.
These topics are discussed in the mass media in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity, which sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.
This is not heard here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, ability to fight the enemy has grown significantly.
It does not fade or fall.
This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.
In fact, the image of Ukraine is holding up, and this is very important.
Good morning.
Sorry to bother you again with my problems.
I am very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
Yesterday they tried to come up with something, but the attempt was in vain.
The mother-in-law's friend who helped to find this apartment also joined the conflict.
She said that she wasn't looking for her for us, and if something doesn't suit us, we should leave and she will make sure that the mother-in-law, not us, stays here.
Unfortunately, none of them think about the child, who is used to this place, considers it his home, and in 3 months there are already 6 homes.
I am very sorry, I could not have guessed that such a situation would happen
Once again, I'm sorry to trouble you.
And regarding the bed, the situation looks strange.
We discussed this issue with my husband before I wrote to you that a bed is not needed.
He came here to see me and the baby and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law decided for herself that he would sleep with her in the room and she wanted to spit on his opinion and wishes.
I am very ashamed in front of you, your husband, Sharka and Jan, the owner of the apartment.
You tried so hard for us
Understood.
I thought that it continued for some long time.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andrii's treatment, to do it at least until the end of the summer?
Maybe we need a certificate for Andrii that he is sick.
In Ukraine, with such a diagnosis, disability would be prescribed.
And just as Inna does not go to kindergarten yet, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the home
Understood, then it would be good to go with you tomorrow.
I will make a barcode for myself and Andrei
I am worried that they will stop providing humanitarian aid for him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a long time.
Can you give me some advice?
I also wanted to ask if you received money for the medicine you bought for Andrii?
The handle mount falls out.
It is short, so you have to be very careful not to lose it.
Only 2 portions were sold today.
Apricot is over.
Poured mango.
Mango is not very good.
Most wanted apricots.
Now they take more vanilla because they don't like mango.
Norm, the mango is gone.
But it started to creak againüò≠
They actively started taking ice cream and he can't handle itüò≠
Tomorrow there will be black currants
Mangoes will definitely run out today, and black currants will run out
I'm shaking all over üò≠
It freezes again, creaks.
Hadnes on 4.0.
As soon as people actively take, he does not let the ice cream at all.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
It's just that there is a queue for ice cream, it starts giving out such nuances and people move on.
Freezes.
If there is no ice cream, it will creak and the piston will rub.
And vanilla cannot be poured into mango.
Can Magdalena come tomorrow at 8.00?
You need to wash the ice cream.
Today the ice cream is finished, and tomorrow another flavor.

Mykola Mikhnovsky first read the text Independent Ukraine in 1990

I believe that there was a dictatorship because people had just left Russia and could not really understand whether they like to be an independent country or they want to be an autonomous Republic of Russia
when Ukraine was independent, there was already Kyiv, but the city of Kharkiv was still in the Soviet Union from 1912 to 1934
I can't say that there were any other interesting events, but if there was democracy in the beginning, it would have been much better and probably now we were in the European Union
