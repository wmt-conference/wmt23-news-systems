Three endangered cheetah cubs were born in Iran
The world's fastest animal falls victim to brutal hunting, droughts and fatal road accidents across the Islamic Republic
As a result, the number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asian cheetah cubs have recently emerged from the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic condition of the endangered animal in the country following droughts, hunters and fatal traffic accidents.
This is the first birth of a captive cheetah in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported that the veterinary team, which is responsible for the Thoran National Park in the northern Semnan Province, decided on an imperial birth in captivity.
It was also noted that fewer than 20 cheetahs have been recorded in seven different provinces in the country.
As a result of the threat to their extinction, the UN implemented a defense plan for them back in 2001.
Now, Iran hopes that the new cubs will be able to increase the cheetah population in the future.
In January, Iran's deputy environment minister Hassan Akbari said the country's cheetah population had dropped dramatically from 100 in 2010 to just 12.
"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their habitats, hunting and even traffic accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching a speed of 100 km/h.
Cheetahs can be found in various places across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: We tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify began to try its luck even in the hardware world
After years of development, Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the US
We got our hands on the first device in Israel
The idea is to make your old cars smart.
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with older vehicles.
A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to individual experimenters in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was outstanding, as our home vehicle broke down and we had to drive for several days with an old system replacement vehicle.
After two weeks of playing around, I realized how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's system.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty about a global launch, I believe that many will prefer to use other solutions.
From Idea to Reality.
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to get an interesting offer in their email box - the option to purchase a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which would make any old car system smart.
The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new product for a vehicle that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, those rumors were back in the headlines again after the music service was updated with the status of the vehicle - the same one we now know from the app - operated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed.
After numerous rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled "Car Thing" in April, its smart system for vehicles.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to deliveries.
So of course, right after the press conference, I went on the website and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement came.
Reconnecting to the site will buy me the opportunity to purchase the device with a little surprise - it will not cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The car thing.
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me greatly with the quality of its construction.
And a little smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a large, bright, sharp touch screen in front of it than I expected.
You'll also find a circular button and dial next to the screen that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer that the company allow me to change the dial activity so that I can control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate through the touch screen.
Perhaps this will be possible in a future revision.
The device comes in a small and minimalist cardboard box, which includes a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you may remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.
The Car Thing certainly brings that feeling back with its construction form.
All the adapters connected to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when traveling on dirt roads.
In addition, all along the top you can find small buttons, which can be easily configured to play different playlists or podcasts.
By pressing one of the buttons while listening, or by asking the voice assistant, I set up some of the playlists I listen to frequently and the radio show I listen to every morning on the road.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
An old car for a smart car
After a fairly simple physical installation, I plugged in the Car Thing.
I was pleasantly surprised by the process.
The instructions were clear, the connection to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote control, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.
That means you'll still have to connect your smartphone to your car, whether through Bluetooth or an AUX cable to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, since like the application on a smartphone, it emphasizes album photos and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations according to your taste, the search screen, and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or using the hand dial.
Moreover, at any given moment, you can call the device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify."
With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
From my experience, she recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.
This is probably due to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of the article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
Is it worth waiting for him?
My experience using the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me considering that it is still in the initial release stage.
Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Nevertheless, from time to time there is a small stutter in the interface, but I believe Spotify will handle such bugs with future version updates.
It is evident that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and among the various versions leaked on the Internet during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to designate it to.
After all, his activity comes down to controlling the smartphone app, and not much else.
What's different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and connecting it so that the smartphone will be closer to us when driving?
This question is reinforced when considering that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and in most cases will buy the user much more functionality.
Nevertheless, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
Being able to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I've come to appreciate over the past two weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company isn't saying much right now.
It hasn't even shared how many test-takers it's currently running worldwide, and how much it plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is that the price is expected to be $79 (about NIS 255).
In the meantime, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse of a concept Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said that there is currently no information on a plan to launch the device in Israel.

Recruiting talent for company?
This way, your competitors won't "steal" you.
The economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is even more true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talents.
Here are some tips to help you keep it in the workplace.
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
Despite the increase in the past month, Israel's unemployment rate remains one of the lowest in the world, and in the top ten of OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150,000 unemployed, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is even more true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talents.
With regard to those professionals and managers who constitute proven centers of knowledge, experience and ability - the trends in the labor market show that the competition for them, the talents as they are called by employers, still exists in full force.
What this means for employers is that in the current state of the labor market, they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after the recruitment of a coveted talent, because the moment it enters the company gates - another company will already try to snatch it to her.
In other words, the competition for talent is so fierce that many of them will continue to receive a variety of tempting job offers, with 30% of the employees leaving only a month after getting the job and starting work.
This is why intelligent employers will immediately move from the talent recruitment stage to its conservation stage, when the path begins first and foremost with pre-preparation and creativity in the process of its absorption.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful absorption process will make the talent enthusiastic about his new job from day one and even look forward to the next.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper absorption process that will help preserve the new talent:
It's not a secret - sharing and organization readiness
Share with the people who will work with him on his recruitment, explain why he is vital and important to the company and the job, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who comes to a place where he is expected and understands his value will feel welcome and will strive to prove the expectations that Ben has.
Knowledge is Power - Coordination of Expectations
On the first day, they held an expectation-coordination conversation with the talent.
Get to know his professional background and see where he sees himself in the future, so you can present him with the diverse and unique tools you and the workplace can provide him to get there.
We are all people - personal acquaintances
During the days of absorption, try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and be interested in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who shows interest in him and allows him to realize and express himself beyond the limits of his position will appreciate this and will want to keep it.
The curiosity advances.
Already at the absorption stage you can create attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily by talking about bonuses and benefits, but by exposing it to an exciting field or interesting technology, as such stimuli to creativity lead to curiosity and increased interest in the workplace.
In addition, the talent was encouraged to voice his thoughts and opinions about the various projects in the company and made it clear to him that they were important to the organization.

Electricity in the Pocket: The Cost of Not Closing Coal Stations in June - NIS 1 Billion
A report by the Knesset Research and Information Center: The failure to close the coal stations on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion
IEC: "The policy of using fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
The economic cost of not closing the coal plants on June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is embodied in the consumer electricity tariff, which is expected to increase in the coming months due to the rising cost of coal.
In addition, an additional excess coal use of about 900,000 tons is expected in 2023, reflecting an additional cost to the electricity sector for the non-closure of coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas remains significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report states that a reduction of NIS 1 billion in the electricity tariff in 2022 meant a reduction of about 4% in the electricity consumption rate for household consumers.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about NIS 1 billion, and the total discount that could have been for the home consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the reform in the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the Israel Electric Corporation, which will establish units powered by natural gas, intended to replace the 4-1 coal units at the Rabin Lights site.
Following this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, which determined that the activity of the 4-1 coal-fired production units at the Orot Rabin power plant should be stopped.
The decision set timetables, so that the construction of the first unit in natural gas will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly the 4-1 coal production units will also cease to operate at this time.
The IEC said in response: "The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the Ministry's decisions, a policy has been implemented in Israel for several years to reduce the use of coal to the minimum possible, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas. "
Paying the Price: Everything you need to know about rising interest rates
Next week, the interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent
How expensive is the mortgage payment?
What's recommended to do?
All the Answers
Increasing inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4 percent in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts estimate an increase of 0.25% to 0.5%.
If the interest rate rises by half a percent, it will already be 1.25 percent, the highest level in nine years.
For years, interest rates in the economy were close to zero.
The sharp increase in the interest rate increases mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and drastically burdens households.
With the help of Shai Tzaror, a mortgage expert, we checked how much more we would pay and what is recommended to do now.
If the interest rate increases by half a percent, how much will the monthly payment on the mortgage be expensive?
In a NIS 1.2 million mortgage, consisting of 40% prime interest rate, the monthly repayment will increase by NIS 125.
How much is the average mortgage rate this year?
Since the beginning of the year, this has been significantly higher.
This is because the interest rates in the other tracks that make up a mortgage (and not only in the prime track) also increased - in the index-linked track and in the fixed-rate track.
If the interest rate does indeed rise by half a percent, the increase will amount, according to Tsror's estimate, to about NIS 620 in a mortgage of about NIS 1.2 million.
The prime track (40% on this track) will increase by about NIS 280, assuming there will be another 0.5% increase next month.
The CPI-linked variable interest rate track (26.7% in this track) will complement an increase of NIS 120.
The fixed-interest track - not index-linked (33.3% in this track) will increase by NIS 220.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have a mortgage that is mostly index-linked, Tzrur recommends considering recycling to tracks that are not indexed.
Mortgage takers whose monthly repayments have increased significantly and find it difficult to meet their repayments - he recommends examining mortgage refinancing and redeploying it for a longer period.
This is to reduce payments despite the increase in interest, since it is better to always meet the repayments and not be in default.
As for new mortgage takers - he strongly recommends getting to know the different routes and adapting the mortgage to their economic capabilities.
The same is true in the future, when interest rates fall, they will be able to refinance with a minimum of early repayment fees.
As for apartment buyers from a contractor - Tsror recommends to advance payments to the contractor and take out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "construction inputs index" raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The price index of residential construction inputs increased by 6.6 percent last year.
Against the background of the increase in this index, the Banking Supervision Department announced yesterday that it is considering creating a mechanism that will enable the inclusion of bonds in mortgages, but the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of fuel is rising - and Israelis will have to pay more than NIS 8 per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price for a liter of 95 octane gasoline will be NIS 8.08
At the same time, a reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022.
A decade-long record: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 agorot per liter - and will stand from July 1 at more than NIS 8 per liter.
The new price for a liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08 and those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 agorot per liter.
At the same time, a reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022, the Tax Authority said.
As mentioned, the increase in the price is due to the continued rise in oil prices, against the background of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in the dollar exchange rate.
Had it not been for the half-shekel discount subsidized by the government since April, the price of gasoline would have passed an all-time high of 8.25 shekels per liter.
The discount expires at the end of July, and the Tax Authority and the Ministry of Finance are currently promoting public comments on an order extending the tax reduction on gasoline, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
In addition, from August 10, a further reduction of another half shekel will be prescribed, so that only from this date will the price of a liter of gasoline decrease by one shekel, until November 15, 2022.
This is reported by the Tax Authority.
"We've reached a point where I don't remember five months in a row of surpluses in state income.
We started a few months ago with the diesel tax reduction issue.
We've been working for a week on a four-month extension of the excise, gasoline and diesel tax - instead of half a shekel.
It's good for industry and people.
If we lower it will affect inflation, reduce production and ease the cost of living.
As finance minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus first of all on this, "Liberman said at the Hurwitz Economic and Social Conference of the Israel Democracy Institute.
To date, more than half of the fuel price is taxes collected by the government (excise tax and VAT) - and this is a high tax rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business expenses, the prices of public transport and flights, transportation costs and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the most business-friendly city
Petah Tikva came in second place in the Ministry of Economy's Doing Business ranking
Next: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon Lezion
Minister Barbibai: "The COVID-19 has emphasized the importance of local government in business development"
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
Ashdod is the friendliest city for small and medium-sized businesses.
For the third year in a row, the local authority's Doing Business Index of the Small and Medium Business Agency in the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranked the local authorities, found.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place is Rehovot.
They are then located in order: Ashkelon, Rishon Lezion, Tel Aviv/Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency conducts the Local Authorities Index.
This is the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a working tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters, and to analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on several parameters that are examined by each authority, which examine the level of "friendliness" of the authority for businesses in its field.
The index divides the local authorities into three size groups according to the number of residents, since a local authority of up to 50,000 residents is not similar to a local authority of more than 150,000 residents.
TA Zinke this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: business satisfaction, access to tenders, access to information and property tax.
The ranking indicates that Ramat Gan dropped from second to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to 12th place and Netanya dropped from fifth place to 13th place.
A decline in the ranking does not mean that the authority's service to businesses has deteriorated, and in many cases it is due to the fact that the service of other authorities to businesses has improved more and they have risen in the ranking, while the authority that fell in the ranking has improved its services to businesses less.
Among the immigrants in the ranking are Petah Tikva, which rose from sixth to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th to third place.
Tel Aviv, which fell from fourth place to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
"Business is a growth engine."
The ranking indicates that Nof Hagalil leads in the local authorities, which include between 50,000 and 150,000 residents.
Next are Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modiin "Maccabim" Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
In the 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The index is intended to encourage local authorities to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the time the business opens and throughout its activity with the authorities," says Economy and Industry Minister Orna Barbibai.
"Businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of business output and about 60% of employees in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct influence on the businesses in it.
"The COVID-19 coronavirus highlighted the importance of local government and we saw that authorities that worked and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, became the first governmental interface for them."
Ran Kaviti, director of the Small and Medium Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and essential part in the ability of businesses in their fields to thrive and flourish.
In the past two years, as we have been dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, the authorities have had more weight in helping businesses survive in their field and survive in general. "
2021 by mail: 20 packages per household - and a leap in their weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020
The average weight per pack is 435 grams - a jump of 36% compared to 2020
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight was 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail packages arrived in Israel, an average of almost 20 packages per household, according to Israel Post data obtained by Israel Hayom.
The number of packages arriving in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019, when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there was a jump of more than 36% a year in the weight of packages that came from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tonnes of products from abroad arrived in Israel, up 36 per cent from 14,860 tonnes in 2020, and 16,743 tonnes in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits.
The average weight per package has jumped 60% in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The increase in the weight of the packages is mainly influenced by two main trends, both from the seller and from the buyer: the major shopping sites abroad combine items for one shipment and no longer send each product from the "shopping basket" in a separate package.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the rapid delivery of shipments, within a few days of the order, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which the purchasers wish to receive shortly after the purchase.
Even in 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month with the highest number of overseas packages and the highest number of items is December, with 4.2 million packages weighing a total of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per pack was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
The Black Friday Effect.
More packages arrived in December than in any other month, likely due to November shopping holidays such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The big orders start arriving in Israel between a week and two weeks after the purchase.
Research: Most of the employees in the economy are not aware that it is possible to get tax refunds
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels
Changed a job?
You've gone abroad?
Moved out of town again?
You may be entitled to an undisclosed amount in a simple procedure
All the details - inside.
Most employees are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can accrue to high amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of NIS 3.6 billion, which means that you should also check whether you are eligible for tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a high amount, since four out of five employees are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, however, several tens of thousands of employees serve annually.
If you think that these funds will go down the drain anyway, think again: Employees can apply for income tax returns for six years back.
Tax: On conducted an in-depth study of 4,000 of its customers regarding tax returns during 2020.
The company has more than 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their distribution in terms of population groups and gender, ages and geography.
The data indicate that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis and the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of workers to the IAF, there were a number of significant changes, centered on a 15% increase in the average return to a household of NIS 4,300 per year.
The reason is that the fees are lower than the salaries and therefore a gap is created between what the employee paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received in 2020 by a customer of the company was NIS 121,054 for refunds over the last 6 years.
What can I get a tax refund for?
One of the reasons to get tax refunds is a change in the workplace.
Eighty-one percent of people who changed jobs during the year received a tax refund of an average of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data show that 74% of women who gave birth and were on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to a reimbursement of NIS 3,538 on average for that year.
Another reason for reimbursement is donations.
100% of people who donate and pay taxes have been reimbursed.
Another factor for reimbursement is the failure to register credit points for alimony. 63%
The divorcees did not update a credit point for alimony, and therefore the tax refund for each year that such a credit point was not updated is NIS 2,616.
Unemployment: 93% of those who became ill or were unemployed and earned more than NIS 12,000 received a tax refund of NIS 4021 for that year.
Other reasons for tax refunds are: reimbursement for life insurance payments, life insurance on a mortgage, exculpatory return, reimbursement for losses in securities, non-registration of credit points for a man for birth and distribution of tax refunds by geographic location.
- 94% of people who deposited for personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In an examination conducted on each NIS 1 million 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax return for the period is above NIS 20,000 for the entire term of the mortgage
100% of those who moved to a beneficiary settlement received a tax refund for the transition year, since approval for residency in a beneficiary settlement is given only after 12 months from the date the resident becomes a beneficiary resident, and thus the first year is actually paid full tax.
79% of customers holding securities were entitled to a tax return for the said years.
However, those who hold securities are important to check every year since losses are not rolled over from year to year but only through the submission of a report.
Fifty-six percent of men who have a child do not write a year-of-birth credit on their pay slip.
The return rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
CEO of Tax: on, Tal Carmon: "The COVID-19 crisis has made the salaried public in Israel much more active.
He is interested, checking and demanding what he deserves in returns from the IRS.
It turns out that sitting at home, in the PLO or after the dismissal of hundreds of thousands of Israelis for months on end, has caused many employees to examine in depth what they deserve from the state.
It is important to know that today, it is possible to carry out all the procedures for receiving tax refunds digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past. "
Job market: fewer job applicants, more wages
The Al-Jobs Report for 2021: Top Demand - Jobs Without Experience
Jobs offered increased by 50%.
"You're looking for a job, but you're not hitting the market."
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decrease in the number of resumes sent, and on each position only 23 candidates ran, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year, according to a report by the Aljubes website for the year 2021, about the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were primarily interested in jobs such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, the inexperienced jobs led the way in demand with more than 38,000 searches - apparently following the return of young people with no professional experience to search for immediate work, at the end of the IAF's payments.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), the drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and the retention had slightly less than 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the COVID-19 crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average wage in Israel was NIS 11,675 gross.
The monthly salary in the field of software was NIS 17,915 on average, and in information systems analysis it was NIS 17,140.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a wage gap of more than 2,000 shekels: in the center of the country it was 12,500 shekels on average, compared to 10,795 shekels in the north and 10,135 shekels in the south.
From a gender perspective, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the amount of hours, was maintained at 36%.
Men earned 13,295 shekels, while women earned 9,740 shekels.
Trying to get back in line.
On the business side, there was across-the-board growth in almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses craved working hands.
Thus, the supply of jobs increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40,000 jobs at Al-Jobs.
A survey conducted by the site among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of them indicated their intention to increase total recruitment but 72% understand that they will have a hard time doing so this year.
The largest supply was for inexperienced jobs - and there were more than 58,000 at the site.
They were followed by customer service and administrative positions with about 44,000 jobs in each field, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 jobs available, and warehouses still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Boimfeld, Director of Research and Content at Al-Jobs: "Job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs in their eyes.
Also, the long disconnect from the workforce makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living. "

"Not obvious": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrating the fact that "we can live the way we want," excited about meeting the audience and making sure to spend time with the children
The weekend and Independence Day of Kobi Shimony, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
Weekends are the most important moments in life for me.
Life and tradition are very deep in my soul.
My Fridays are dedicated to children, Or (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and kiddush supplies, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play in remote control cars.
Sometimes we go to the beach, or even just wash the car, but we always stop on the way to buy a gift at the toy store in the neighborhood - and there's always another excuse.
When we return home with our gifts, the smell of cooking greets us. "
What does your Friday dinner look like?
"I'm blessed to cook around.
On my side is a Persian-Tunisian kitchen, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, poetry and joy.
On the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
When we reach my mother-in-law, the building's lobby smells amazing from her apartment.
I usually do the Kiddush, together with the children, who know it by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of bloater. "
Do you have a special memory of the weekend?
"As a child, I would wake up on Saturday to Israeli music on Reshet Gimel and the Pale Tracker sketches, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in Israel, usually to the north.
Every corner of the country made him proud.
He passed away three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Kiddush and Shabbat were the Holy of Holies, especially in terms of the whole family being together.
I recently released a song in his memory called "Guarding You," which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe he was proud of this work, which sanctifies the bond between father and son. "
We will soon mark the 74th Independence Day. As an enthusiastic Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a holy day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents were forced to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who gets to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I would have climbed trees and tied strings to a house with Israeli flags.
Today my independence days are full of performances, and you always meet an insanely happy audience, who celebrate that we can live the way we want.
We must make sure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren also have this option, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted. "
Its Friday: Esti Zakheim welcomes the Sabbath
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": a Friday dinner that Abla Zakheim dreams of, and how does she deal with the fact that her husband keeps Shabbat?
Tell me about your preparations for sitting.
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
"Preparations begin on Thursday night, when I come back from a show or workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking like a goulash, roasts and sauces.
On Friday, the first part of the day, I take the time to myself, to meet friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I rehearse.
In the summer the Saturdays come late, and I have a lot of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just a good series.
For Shabbat dinner, I usually have my mother, Varda, who turned 89, and friends, too. "
Can you share more cooking?
"I like shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry it.
On my Shabbat table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
I cook most of the meals, and of course they are heated on the palette on Saturday.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, a vegetable salad and in the winter - the cholent. "
Your husband is a religious man and you're from a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with a Shabbat watchman is an endless compromise.
"Love thy neighbor as thyself," in effect.
For family trips he couldn't go out, so I often found myself packing up the kids and joining family trips of friends.
In addition, I am also the on-call leader of the children, the one who brings them back Friday night from parties and meetings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Shabbat, because I don't usually show up on Shabbat and get a kind of "forced vacation" - and that's a good thing. "
Who would you like to meet on Saturday?
"I'd open a big table and invite" My Dead. "
Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if my late brother Daniel were alive, or if my father, the late Shneur, saw my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
We'd probably fight about football and politics and revel in each other. "
Do you have a special memory of the weekend?
"We were a warm, united family.
On Friday afternoon, my mother would prepare a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pita bread from the market, and burn eggplants for tahini salad.
Then we'd drive to Aunt Hannah's in Yad Eliyahu, or as she would say, "Yad Eliaka," and she'd make blintzes.
Since only I didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the brothers, and cared for me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father in the Jaffa port, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing. "

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck got engaged.
Nearly two decades after their love affair ended in a breakup, Lopez and Affleck are back in each other's arms.
Lopez splits from baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
His one: Almost two decades after their first love story ended in a breakup and a year after the high-profile comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic circle and engaged.
Lopez shared the happy news with her fans on her official website, onthejlo.com.
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
News of the engagement comes after this week Lopez was documented walking around with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
Remember, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and offered Lopez (52) to be his forever was in 2002, when it was an eye-popping ring with a huge six-carat pink diamond, valued at about $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two separated in 2004, accusing the media of being too obsessive and constantly probing their lives.
Since then, Affleck has been married to actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez has been married three times, including to singer Marc Anthony, who together became parents to twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she broke up in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians say, "You can't invent what happens to us."
"The never-ending chaos," mom Kris Jenner insists on new series starring reality TV's first family, and gets backing from her daughters and new producer
In an article that will be published in "Sheshiba" magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR grinder, the brands factory and the change that Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm not the same person who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie should be uploaded"
This may come as a surprise to many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 of the Disney content empire, which among other things also includes the Marvel movies and "Star Wars," is the Kardashians.
Details of the contract of the first family of reality TV and social networks with Disney were not disclosed, but estimates claim a minimum of $100 million was transferred to the girls of the family, who now also function as producers.
In a press meeting with the stars, each of them accompanied by a whole beauty team that takes care of makeup, hair and wrinkles in clothes nonstop, the family members, as well as their new and wanted producer, insisted that this time it's not about reality, this time what you get on the screen is completely authentic.
"You can't invent what's happening to us," says family mother Kris Jenner, "the chaos is never-ending."
"We're showing how much we've grown since that show in 2007," says Khloe Kardashian.
"When we started we were terrified, a lot happens to us in life and it is impossible to confine everything simply to the narrative of beginning, middle and end.
A lot of storylines were rushed through editing, wrapped in a ticking color film, and forgotten.
That's not what real life looks like.
Now we're more exposed, facing the camera directly in a natural way, not just reality TV but an authentic documentary series. "
When confronted with their new involvement in the production of the series, which effectively gives them total control over the content received on screen, Chloe claims: "We're involved behind the scenes, seeing footage while editing and giving comments, but not from a place of defensiveness but simply giving our opinion about what would make the series better.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel I've gone through emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they're more about setting boundaries. "
"Growing Up"
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all the power to change her image, from a cheap reality show to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I've grown up," she says, "I'm raising four black children, that is, from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change the reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
That's my motivation. "
"I'm not the same Kim who spends hours thinking about which bikini selfie to put on," she insists, "but it hasn't completely disappeared from my life either.
One must be true to who one is and take it all in stride. "
On the reasons for firing the producer Ryan Seacrest discovered them and their new and very profitable way in the industry, the significance of the move to Disney, the family's well-oiled PR machine and its impact on the brand's profitability, and more, in the full article that will be published in the magazine "Shishbat."

The international festival in the capital, which has become a tradition and will take place in several locations, will present musical performances by leading local artists, and will combine circus performances and innovative and surprising artistic performances.

Like every summer over the years, along with the warmth, humidity and boredom of the students, there is also the international festival "Hutzot Hayotzer" in Jerusalem, which has already become a tradition in the capital and will be held in a number of locations (including Mitchell Park, the Sultan's Pool, opposite the Tower of David and at the foot of the Old City walls) - between August 15-27.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The "Next Star" winner finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life
"The song is about how to stay in touch," he says.
Tamir Greenberg in his second single "Into the Night" after capturing the audience with his first single and his participation in "The Next Star."
In recent months, Greenberg has continued to perform in many shows: Tel Aviv Cultural Center, Tel Aviv Opera House, Amphi Shoni, Amphi Yehoshua Gardens, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
"Into the Night" was produced and adapted by Greenberg with producer Stav Bager.
The video, directed by Daria Geller, returns Tamir to memories of his childhood and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song is about the relationship between my father and me.
About the time I left the country for the United States and the way to keep in touch from afar, "Greenberg says.
In the coming month, Greenberg will perform at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and ahead of the new season of "The Next Star," the song with which he won the program, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Blue and White: Yuval Shamla is the season's biggest winner and the 16th ninja in the world
The phenom climbed Madoryama Mountain in 26 seconds and won the title of "Israel's First Ninja."
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of ninja.
The Isle of Wight
There is a winner: Yuval Mala conquered the Midoriyama, and he is the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel" and now holds the first and 16th Israeli Ninja title in the world.
He finished the season in first place, but in the second season he lost to Gil Marantz.
In the third season, he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be the last season.
He climbed Mt. Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after beating the contestants Yogev Malka and Yishai Kalfon.
He managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season there can be only one ninja who managed to climb the Midoriyama in time.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, as the unbeaten Jubilee climbed the Midoriyama three seconds faster, Malka does not win the ninja world title.
He will be able to compete again next season.
Well, we realized, that full superhero, Rotem rock perfect, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sporting event in the world
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sportscaster sat in the finals of a reality show and acted like it was the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
Rotem Sela represents for us such a perfect feminine ideal, that it is perverse to present it this way on television.
She makes more money on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she's too beautiful, she knows how to put Dana Weis in his place, and when necessary - to advocate for her business partner.
She is a mother and also a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads series and reality shows, and serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Rock passes too perfect a screen, because the show she hosts has to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the ninja world, everyone is larger than life, and the facilitators come first.
After all, Assi Azar was entangled in an affair that was supposed to wipe him off the screen for a certain period of time, but since he is not an ordinary human being - he got out of it even before the first batch of advertisements.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niamh Raskin, who broadcast his life winning European and world records, but is moved by the mega-wall as if it is the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the final, two Olympic medallists (Yarden Gerbi and Linoy Ashram) sat alongside him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the conditions for entering the superhuman world presented by this reality show for four seasons.
"Ninja Israel" went out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mt. Midoriyama and Yuval Shamla who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned a ninja.
It was there that an almost impassable path led, one by one, to the overthrow of all the superhuman characters that the show had arranged to inflate their egos throughout the year.
Want to be a Ninja Turtle?
Not with us.
They're looking for heroes here.
The emphasis was on searching for a successor to Meshla, the so-called "one-of-a-kind King of Kings," and other aliases to make it clear how perfect and unique he was.
As a result, the difficulty level was raised, the girls who tried to compete in the season tracks crashed, and the boys competed between them for who has more squares in the stomach and plywood charisma to step into the shoes of the retiring schmallah.
They will say that this is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges, but for the vast majority of viewers - medium armchair yams like us - "Ninja Israel" nurtures for us a sporting model - an unattainable achievement.
Faster, stronger, taller, more perfect.
When Gil Sassover moves between punches and conversations about holiness
It is strange to see the comedian, Ex "Comedy Store," host a "Kabbalah Shabbat" program on Channel 14, in which he tastes pots and gives a stage mainly to men
If we play a game of associations, we will all have similar answers to the question, "What does the concept of" preparing for Shabbat "remind you of?"
Say: Sponge and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi as a TV operator, but the strangest thing would be if someone suddenly said "Gil Sassover."
Because Gil Sassover in the middle of the saponja and the cooking is the most unrelated that television can offer.
And indeed, "Kabbalah Shabbos," the new program he hosts on Friday afternoon on Channel 14, is completely detached from the hour it is broadcast.
For half of the time, Sassoubar stands.
He speaks quickly, holding a microphone even as he tastes dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punches and conversations about holiness.
In his defense, the meagre budget is felt, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also felt in the premiere show, which aired the day before yesterday from the Binyamin headquarters, is a clear gender division.
The men sing, play, dance, speak Torah, market restaurants and factories - while the women made do with a small item, in which they excitedly told about the management of a sewing shop.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Getting a Shabbat with Gil Sassover, now 14
The assisted living association against Ruti Russo: "Saying'it tastes like assisted living' harms our activity"
Chairwoman Yuli Gat sent a letter, in which she expressed the union's complaint against an insulting statement, according to them, by the "next restaurant" judge in one of the trailers for the show
Ruthie Russo: "I'm glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population."
The Association of Retirement Homes and Protected Accommodation in Israel against "The Next Restaurant": In a letter sent by Chairwoman Yuli Gat to Israel Hayom, it was written: "The trailer before the broadcast, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, describes that the professional judge of the competition said" food tastes like sheltered housing, "i.e. closed institution food with low-level food."
"The tone chosen by the show's judge, Ruti Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food submitted by the contestant immediately cancels our many years of activity to fight against the existing ignorance in the field, because the sheltered housing houses operate in the various houses restaurants for the benefit of the residents with chef dishes at the highest level."
"The service teams and home managers are fighting for the image of assisted living that offers solutions for quality housing for the elderly, including alleviating loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living, and more."
In Israel in recent years, more and more families and elderly people understand that loneliness is the most difficult disease in old age and see the community as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, so we dedicate resources and efforts to serving the occupants the finest food.
Most assisted living facilities use professional chefs to build a menu.
We will be happy at any time to invite the judges to be impressed by the winning dishes that are served daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant teams in the sheltered housing houses, we ask for your apologies and clarification.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly. "
Ruti Rousseau said in a statement: "I am pleased that there are places that are investing more in the culinary life of this population, which certainly deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, sanes and chefs everywhere, even in the sheltered housing. "
"Double standard: in Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer referred to criticism leveled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards
"The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"Immortal"
Nick Cave cancelled a concert in Russia earlier this week because of the war, declaring that he "stands with Ukraine and prays for the madness to end soon."
In doing so, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled shows in the invading country.
But in Kiev's case, his cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet slammed the singer as a hypocrite, as in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two shows in Israel, despite much criticism from pro-Palestinian groups.
During his visit to Israel, Kiev told the local media: "In the end, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."
The same Ahmet remembered Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even published a poignant post on the singer's personal, uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files," in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying state, and therefore the situation of Palestine is the same as that of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your announcement about Ukraine," Ahmet wrote, "is that you did not support the Palestinians, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost responsible for Palestinian suffering.
This makes me very sad, as you represent a double standard here, "the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story does not end here, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he stressed that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is a previous unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, in the hope of changing the security order of Europe as a whole.
The second situation is a complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel great sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are and who they are. "
Kiev added that while he was not interested in detailing his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supported the Palestinians as well, noting that over the past 20 years he has participated in many fundraising events for them.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Ahmet, it is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently experiencing a catastrophe on their soil.
I have great admirers in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them, I would. "
In light of the decline in the incidence of COVID-19, the COVID-19 projector will return to run Ziv Hospital
Prof. Salman Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of dealing with the coronavirus in the third and fourth waves
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, will continue in his role as a projector
Prof. Zarka: "I am glad that the omicron wave continues to fade, and it is still our duty to prepare for another wave"
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
Against the background of the decline in COVID-19 morbidity, the COVID-19 projector, Prof. Salman Zarka, will return to run Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue as a projector.
"I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the omicron wave continues to fade and that we have received our normal way of life back," said Prof. Zarka, adding: "It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of disease as a result of the virus still being here, in Israel and around the world."
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of treating COVID-19 in the third and fourth waves.
From May 1, Israel returned to a state of "between waves," which includes reducing most of the COVID-19 levels, while maintaining the ability to conduct sequencing tests and investigations, which will serve as a basis for action in the event that a new variant is discovered.
Concealed Illness
The report of the National Corona Campaign Knowledge and Information Center, published this morning, noted that "there is a decrease in the average number of new verified persons to less than 2,000 per day, on the weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized and seriously ill patients."
However, they stressed that "there is latent morbidity at significant levels and in practice the number of infected is much higher.
The number of institutional tests carried out in the community (without the weighting of tests from abroad, M.I.) is low, and stands at less than 20,000 tests on a weekly average only.
The low level of testing makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends. "
State Comptroller's Report: The Actual Budget for Most Years of the Drug Basket Committee's Activity is Less Than the Recommended Budget
According to the report of Matanyahu Engelman, during the more than 20 years of activity of the basket, the Ministry of Health did not supervise the activities of the committee.
The report also states that the minutes of the meetings are being published significantly late, if at all.
In addition, the Comptroller recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activities and updating the basket work procedures.
Another flaw found relates to the fact that since the committee began its activities, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the extent of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket - which would have made it possible to analyze and control the budget given to them.
The Pharmaceutical Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and health.
Every year, the committee decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the health funds - but a new report by the State Comptroller published on Tuesday warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without any control reports on its activity and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council monitoring and examining its activity.
Israel Hayom correspondent Ran Reznik adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing exposures in Israel Hayom about the drug basket failures.
According to the report by Matanyahu Engelman, he recommends "making repairs and improvements in the basket expansion process, which will lead to a better quality utilization of the health basket budget to which the public is entitled."
Throughout the years of the addition mechanism to the basket of medicines, in the years 1998-2021, NIS 8 billion were added to the state budget, with the addition moving annually in amounts ranging from NIS 0 to NIS 500 million.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the healthcare basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated for expanding the basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.
In most years of the committee's activity (90% of the time), the budgetary increase was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired increase rate.
The comptroller notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual supplement in order to enable certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that "the transparency model in basket work is lacking."
Thus, for example, the Hassel Committee's work procedure states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 160-109 days, when sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in the publication of the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; as a result, the ability of the submitters of the proposals - hospital organizations and pharmaceutical companies - to submit repeated requests as soon as possible and as relevant, after they learned lessons from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and revised their proposals and reassessed the feasibility of accepting them in the next round," the Comptroller noted in the report.
"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules set forth in the procedure."
Out of thousands of submissions, only one financial comment was submitted.
Another criticism of Engelman relates to the preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the basket of medicines.
The comptroller found that about half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.
Another impairment relates to the activities of the Drug Basket subcommittee, which is closed to the media and the public, and in which patient numbers and costs of drugs are discussed.
The Comptroller recommends that a public representative be appointed or that the possibility of publicizing the discussions to the public be examined without confidential commercial details.
According to the procedure by which the Health Services Basket Committee operates, "an economic assessment must be submitted" for a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years only one of thousands of submissions has been submitted - and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, the Hassel Committee's hearings for 2021-2019 submitted requests to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report found that the requests did not include economic estimates, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing the damage of obesity-related diseases or due to the ability to avoid gastric surgery.
It also emerges that the decisions of the Pharmaceutical Basket Committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparations for the treatment of tumors in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The Comptroller also warns that since 2011, services that are not under the responsibility of the HMOs have also been included in the basket of medicines, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, which are given by the Ministry of Health (the "Third Supplement").
This is when the legal framework for this step is regulated only retroactively.
In the past six years, NIS 74 million of the supplement to the medical basket has been used for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the basket are defined as "drugs with no additional cost," whose use does not cost the health funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The Comptroller proposes to examine the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and abbreviated track, so that the basket of drugs can be updated several times a year and not only once a year.
There is no control over the use of expensive drugs.
The criticism also indicates that since the ETF began its work 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked HMOs to report and has not supervised the scope of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have enabled the Ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the health plans.
Over the years, only two reports relating to the years 2006-2009 were published, and these too were published with considerable delay (the last one was published this year and dealt with the utilization of the budget in 2007-2009).
"The delay in conducting examinations may lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, to the irrelevance of the conclusions arising from the examination after such a long period, to improper pricing of the subcommittee and to decisions based on inconclusive findings," the report said.
In addition, the Ministry also does not review and supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not learned any lessons.
These are 10 drugs that constituted 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in the years 2021-2016).
The comptroller wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use in comparison with the estimates.
Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the subcommittee, and about how to prepare and improve estimates when pricing drugs and technologies. "
"Shocking and incomprehensible": heated debate in the Health Committee on the poisoning in Beit Dafna
Indices on the first deceased ward were normal ten minutes before her death.
MK Silman, chairman of the committee: "If people there cared that the kitchen would be like home, it wouldn't look like this."
Ten minutes before the first patient, a 40-year-old girl from Beit Dafna in Holon, died of food poisoning, she was taken medical measures that were in order, she claimed today (Tuesday) in a hearing at the Health Committee.
"We have night caregivers who check in during the night and there is a nurse who does rounds.
There were several reports of cases of diarrhea and the same tenant actually last took her measurements were 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was monitored like the other Dacres with diarrhea.
She's a long-term care patient. We went to get Menoch to assist in her transfer, and then that tenant didn't respond.
We started CPR and called the clinic nurse, "the daycare manager described what happened last Sunday morning at the daycare center.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized and a total of about a quarter of the residents of the daycare center (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea to eat contaminated goulash meat.
The director of the daycare center said this against the backdrop of allegations that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up by the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Noss, head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, noted that "we cannot determine conclusively what the three friends died of.
Only blood tests were taken. "
The discussion also revealed that even among the residents who were hospitalized, it was no longer possible to obtain a stool sample because they had not been thrown out, and therefore it was not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
An engineer from the Ministry of Health noted that "the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary status of kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs or at the request of renewal of a license."
The Welfare Ministry admitted that the commission of inquiry has not yet been appointed to this case and to a previous case of abuse of the shelters that occurred three months ago at the Bnei Zion institution in the Sharon.
MK Idit Silman, chairwoman of the Health Committee, said during the hearing: "If people cared that the kitchen would be like home, it wouldn't look like this.
The welfare boarders need more.
They are sensitive to health and need extra care and attention.
It's shocking and unimaginable what happened there.
The terrible findings were discovered after they knew that the Health Ministry had come to check.
Where are the responsibilities and responsibilities?
How is it that in such a discussion the ministers and the directors-general of the ministries are not present to explain what is going on here? "
Yigal Natsumi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who runs the daycare and even managed the daycare center himself, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire system rise up with only one goal: to do good to people.
The people who died are people I personally cared for.
I fell asleep on one of my hands.
It's an event for us. "
Smadar Ona, a former resident of an identical residence at her age, snapped at him and said, "Enough with the lies and the beautiful words.
I was there. "
Gali Bermi, a representative of the parents at Akim Israel: "We complained about the food in the past and did not accept the criticism."
Oren Hellman, founder of the Equal Opportunity to Integrate People with Disabilities Project, protested that the names of the deceased residents were not published: "Their names are not known at all.
Are they worth less?
They are degrading our children's lives. "
The surgeon caused a rupture in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Pras Abu Akar as director of the chest surgery unit at the hospital.
The chairman of the doctors' committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, had been warned before his appointment.
Hospital: "He's highly regarded and experienced"
First publication: A horrific mistake occurred at the Wolfson government hospital in Holon, when during the operation the doctor ruptured the patient's heart, leading to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient took place on April 19.
This was the first operation performed by Dr. Pras Abu Akar in the hospital, after he was appointed director of the chest surgery unit in Wolfson.
During the operation, designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large rupture in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.
However, the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised serious questions regarding the management of the hospital.
The director of the Oncology Institute and the chairman of the committee of doctors, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation of the affair in a letter he sent to the director of the hospital, Dr. Anat Engel.
The letter raised very serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital at Tel Hashomer.
Huge hole in heart.
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient was lucid, functional and had been treated by him for the past four years.
He recently had a spread of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid was discovered in the pericardium, in which the heart muscle is located.
Also, the surgeon, Dr. Abu Akar, was impressed that he could perform the operation.
According to the complaint, the surgery had a serious malfunction, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, head of heart and chest surgery at Wolfson, who was in a child's surgery in the next room at the time, "was rushed to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."
He said the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressure was zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel contacted him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar was not professionally and personally suitable for managing a chest surgery unit in Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and although he was supposed to be the direct manager of the chest surgeon, Dr. Engel carried out a tender without sharing it and accepted Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
He added: "This is an uncomplicated process, which lasts a few minutes," adding: "It is impossible not to relate to the flawed process of accepting Dr. Abu Akar to the position.
The question arises whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the operation and the death of the patient. "
Experienced Surgeon
Israel Hayom has received information and claims from other senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised in the case by Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, chief of surgery at Wolfson A, responded to Brenner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is "one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young chest surgeon."
He added that he was chosen in a proper tender and Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements about his desire to "disengage" from the chest unit.
He added: "I wasn't part of the process either, and maybe I was meant to be.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Pras Abu Akar began working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace, "All the hospital doctors were impressed by his professionalism and motivation and willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of similar procedures, and unfortunately the current case ended as it did in a regrettable manner.
Wolfson Hospital said in a statement: "We share the family's grief.
This is oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner's patient.
The chest surgeon mentioned in the article is an esteemed surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in the tender for the management of a chest surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, the words quoted are inaccurate and were taken out of context.
It is important to note that this is a patient who is in very serious condition.
The hospital examines the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case. "

A Model for Healing: Three Top Doctors Talk About Their Mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, especially during the plague.
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh does not forget, even from the height of his position, the push from the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik
Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev thanks Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld for the lesson in identifying with patients
Three key people in hospitals write about who inspired them and encouraged them to be better, both as caregivers and as human beings.
Three senior physicians, three life and professional teachers: On the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, "Israel Hayom" invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to remember the characters who accompanied them in the beginning - and helped them become who they are today.
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of Sheba's Infectious Diseases Unit
About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira
The meeting that opened my eyes - and changed my life
Had I not met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the infectious diseases unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained a specialist in internal medicine.
He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to engage in it.
I met him in the halls of Hadassah, back in the 1980s.
For a moment I didn't think I would leave the inner room, because I loved the treatment of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also expressed in neurology, also in the inner room, and in virtually every area.
Thank you for bringing me into this field.
All along, I liked his investigative approach, one that gets to the root of the problem.
Discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved the sick and taught me not to take things for granted and to look into everything.
He was a real, honest man, devoid of ego, qualities I loved very much about him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was my role model and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, Dr. Yosef Rakover z "l, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who inspired me to go into medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapiro.
Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day - for example, "Tissot Is de Ishio," that is, taking a tissue biopsy from the infected organ makes it possible to know which drugs should be given; or "Won Yoo Hughes It, Yoo Luz It," which is meant to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked at Hadassah and had two daughters.
He died a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven I cried.
He was something - a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to treat epidemics, and is sorely missed during this period.
Had he been with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted with him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the pandemic treatment team.

About the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
" cHFFFFFF <unk>
I met the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik for the first time when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I went on a tour of internal medicine in the internal medicine department D, which he managed.
Later on, I also returned to the department in my sixth year, and I did the medical school thesis under his direction, writing a computerized simulation of a patient with polyarthritis (multiple joint inflammation).
Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life for 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; not only professionally, but also - and mainly - personally and humanly.
During the internship, I debated between family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about choosing an internship.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.
During my internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways - in scientific writing (sorry Shaul, I didn't do enough), in contact with patients, in working in a multi-disciplinary team - a field in which the department excelled - and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I recognize in me, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from Shaul.
When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go to study abroad, Shaul pushed and directed me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.
The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and push, I'm not sure it would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital's management, it was again Saul who supported and assisted.
We went through difficult times together in the internal medicine department.
Shaul knew how to wonderfully integrate the teacher, the manager, the friend and the partner in the team, without his various roles interfering with each other.
I want to be as successful as he is in this game.
He has raised generations of students, interns and interns, who are now present throughout the medical system in Israel, and who perpetuate his memory and work through their excellent work.
I am honored to be part of this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director, Schneider Children's Medical Center
About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Schinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at Schneider Children's, taught me how to be an intensive care doctor, but more than that, he taught me how to think.
The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, the sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious one is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult ones, with families who never imagined they would find themselves in these complex situations in an intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but that's the obvious.
But I learned even more profound and profound things from him.
In retrospect, since I am a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, it is clear to me today the connection between the worlds; the education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurses, to the teams of therapists, young and old, and to listen to the parents.
All this must be done not only in order to communicate in a more correct and successful manner, but in order to constantly gather a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The prophylactic processes in child care are everywhere, and of course in intensive care.
Listening and dialogue stimulate a deeper understanding, both on the part of the treating staff and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at an entire system.
The more in-depth and rigorous the understanding that integrates all the caregivers into the discourse, the more accurate the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and especially - early enough to prevent future damage, immediate or distant.
That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He's a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, to listen - and then apply.

Medical malpractice during the different stages of birth
In order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence.
Childbirth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in the life of a family.
However, unfortunately, sometimes births end in severe damage caused to the mother or the newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where the birth ended in physical injury, to a newborn or mother, there is room to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in the field of medical negligence will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical team during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, as far as he sees fit, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that management was negligent.
When is it about negligence?
When the doctor's error was due to a lack of skill or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the usual level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused had the doctor not done so.
In this article, we will examine the various stages of childbirth, explain what complications may occur at each stage and when they rise to medical malpractice.
The Axes Stage
The contraction stage lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix is gradually opened (in order to allow the fetal passage at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most cases of medical negligence at the contraction stage deal with the failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, which is sometimes even expressed in cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy may be caused by non-identification or delay in the identification of perinatal asphyxia, which results in a failure in the supply of oxygen to the fetal brain tissue.
As a rule, monitoring the mother's condition and correct decryption of the fetal heart monitor should lead to early identification of fetal distress development, allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.
In cases where the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or that the team is not interpreting the data correctly and in particular the fetal monitor or responds late to the distress expressed in the monitor - this may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by the prolapse of the umbilical cord as well as a rupture in the uterus that was not detected in a timely manner.
Even in these difficult events, it is worth finding out whether the medical team acted properly.
For example, Adv. Anna Rafe Liganza, of Caspi Srour & Co., a firm specializing in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her firm handled a claim of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the head of the fetus was too high, thereby causing the umbilical cord to prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the head of the fetus) and damage to the supply of oxygen to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure from the head of the fetus on the umbilical cord) and to be born with a severe neurological injury.
In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a claim due to serious medical negligence of the maternity department staff at a large hospital, which during the birth did not identify at the time any clear signs that required a real suspicion that the woman suffered a rupture of the uterus in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy.
The embryo that was ejected through the rupture in its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a later stage, when it was on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
It should be emphasized that in order to be awarded compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the child and the damage caused to the newborn, that is, that the damage was caused as a result of the aforesaid negligence and not from any other reason or factor.
An examination of the causal relationship will be carried out by examining medical indices that according to the medical literature only exist when there is a causal connection between the brain injury and the brain injury.
Among other things, the measurements of the level of acidity in the embryo's blood, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage, and more are examined.
Passing the Pass.
The active birth stage.
The active stage of labor begins when the cervical opening reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Delay in childbirth and avoidance of cesarean section
In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., a lack of progression of the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damage that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.
"There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner may cause irreparable damage to the fetus," explained attorney Rafe-Liganza.
"For example, we conducted a medical malpractice claim for a newborn death caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.
In contrast to any known medical practice, the medical staff did not succeed in identifying the fetal distress and performing a cesarean section despite the particularly slow progression of the birth.
The delay in performing the surgery caused extensive systemic damage to the birth, which eventually led to her death shortly after birth. "
Vacuum birth negligence
In situations where the mother or the fetus is in significant danger that requires an especially rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed (an empty studio).
In this process, a "dome" vacuum is attached to the head of the fetus and the fetus is pulled out by force.
Naturally, this action is fraught with dangers and can cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great caution, precision and skill.
In these cases, medical malpractice may be expressed in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the binding guidelines and performs the action despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the head of the fetus is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for a longer time than permitted, or when despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the action more than the permitted number of attempts.
In such cases, if the negligent vacuum operation caused the newborn damage - among other things, it may cause cranial damage and bleeding that may cause brain damage - there is room for filing a tort claim.
It's called ERB.
Erb's paralysis is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth, it is worth checking whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric team.
The injury is manifested by weakness of the muscles of the hand and can reach the full paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by a difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a "shoulder disorder" - a midwifery emergency that occurs when the fetus' shoulders are trapped in the birth canal after its head has come out.
When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the fetus's weight assessment indicated that it was a macrosomic embryo, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kg and in accordance with the instructions, it is better to deliver the mother by Caesarean section.
When the newborn's weight is over 4 kg, a cesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.
In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to continue with vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder disorder and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical malpractice.
Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance to some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a concern for its occurrence, is to perform a cesarean section."
The placental exit phase
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the neonate exits and is accompanied by bleeding.
In most cases, the process lasts up to half an hour from the time the baby leaves and usually occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the placenta is removed, the medical team will check whether the placenta is intact or if there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.
Within this stage, complications may occur that may cause serious harm to the mother.
One of the known complications as a result of the residual placental in the uterus is called "Asherman syndrome," the scarring of the uterine wall results in inflammation caused by the residual placental in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that does not allow implantation of pregnancy.
Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not identify placental residues or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the endometrium despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, it may be medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
Death of mother.
Death during childbirth is very rare.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother on time or respond late to such bleeding.
"For example," Rife-Liganza told us, "our firm filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a mother, when in that case the medical team ignored and did not respond to the mother's alarming vital signs, for many hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrolled bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the background disease from which she suffered."
"In another case," said attorney Rafe-Liganza, "our firm represented the relatives of a mother who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated in the C-section that was not properly sewn.
In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical team did not properly treat her complaints and her clinical condition, reacted late only after her body systems began to fail, which led to her death. "
Loss of uterus
In severe cases, medical malpractice at birth can lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Rafe Lingza: "Our firm has managed a lawsuit against a hospital that is based on a hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.
In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding that was observed by the medical team after the birth, and yet no action was taken to prevent the damage. "
What are the compensations awarded in claims for medical negligence at birth?
Newborn compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts given for pain and suffering, nursing and wage care, salary and pension losses for the injured person and even for his parents and other components of damage.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for salary and pension losses is calculated in most cases based on the average wage in the economy.
In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitative accessories, the cost of accommodation for the baby's needs, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined in each case and according to its circumstances," recounts attorney Rafe-Liganza, and she adds that "today most claims on the grounds of medical negligence end in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each side has in conducting the procedure," but the lawyer added that "there are cases in which the procedure ends only in a judgment, in which case if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages, and for example, in a lawsuit that our firm conducted, the District Court ruled that a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress will receive compensation in excess of ten million shekels."
Summarize
Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by a lawyer skilled in managing claims on the grounds of medical negligence, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of keratoconus eye disease in the south
Research has shown that there is a link between the development of the disease and the marriage of relatives
The highest incidence was found in the Bedouin sector
Expert: "It is possible that in any sector with many weddings between cousins, there is a high incidence of the disease."
Keratoconus is a hereditary eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it early, and find correct solutions to prevent worsening the situation.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted that help to understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide a basis for the suspicion that keratoconus eye disease is a genetic disease.
A recent study, which dealt with the transformation of the corneal shape from a cape to a cone, found that the reason for the disease and weakness of the cornea and its deformation is related to an enzyme imbalance, following which free radicals can damage the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The source of this enzyme deficiency is genetic, which reinforces the hypothesis that keratoconus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariella Gordon-Shag, head of the Department of Optometric Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, "In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, there was a prevalence of keratoconus of 3.2%.
The highest prevalence was among Bedouin students - 20% had keratoconus, but there was a relatively small sample. "
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: "There is a large incidence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that close marriages are a risk factor for keratoconus disease.
So in any sector with many weddings between cousins, we may find a high incidence. "
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where a family story of keratoconus disease appears, all family members should get an appropriate eye exam as soon as possible.
According to Arza Fruchter, clinical optometrist B.Sc., "there is a tenfold turn to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, mainly from the south, as opposed to the center."
Fruchter adds, "In the past decade, I have noticed that most patients come from the periphery, especially from the Be'er Sheva area.
This is mainly due to a high incidence of marriage within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of the correct treatment of the problem. "
How is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or late teens (ages 16-15 or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, in parallel with an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients indicate distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over the years.
However, the disease may also develop rapidly and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many patients also show increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the Gaza operation, the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M'; Bennett: "Now, the people know the face of Israel's hero"
Mahmoud Khair al-Din from Hurfeish is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in the operation in Khan Yunis
"He deserves the publicity, his family and his children."
Later, we will examine the possibility of publishing a picture of Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from Sayeret Matkal
About three-and-a-half years after the operation in Khan Yunis, the IDF today permits the publication that the fatality in the operation, Lt. Col. M, is Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khair ad-Din, of blessed memory, from the village of Hurfeish in the north.
He was 41 when he fell.
Bennett said: "It has been three and a half years since Lt. Col. Mahmoud Hir Al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the state.
"The late Mahmoud was a fighter in a paratrooper patrol and later grew up in the army to be a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's special operations.
"" " " "."
"I eulogized him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and face of the hero of Israel, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hir Al-Din, openly.
The surroundings caught his eye.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the Intelligence Division, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, a hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in Kfar Hurfeish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmad and Nazira, and has seven brothers and sisters.
He's the Druze witness.
He was married to Nehad and had two sons.
He served as an officer, combatant and commander in the Special Operations Division of the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Hir ad-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him.
He attended high school in Kfar Hurfeish, and then moved to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997 he joined the Paratroopers Patrol, and in 2000 he graduated from the Officers' School.
In 2002, he was assigned to the Special Operations Unit at Military Intelligence and moved to serve there.
During his service he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002 he met his wife, Nahad, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the "Aharai" association and began guiding a group in the village of Hurfeish, after he made sure that the association would start working in the Druze villages to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, head of Military Intelligence, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "It is time that we turn to the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair ad-Din, a hero of Israel.
We finished the work and concluded that there was no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.
He deserves it too, his family and his children, "he said.
"Extraordinary Educator and Leader"
"Because of many operations, he is nothing short of a hero in my eyes," said the Chaliva general.
"He has made a significant contribution, which has courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He deserves the right place for him. "
He added: "I didn't know him personally, but he was an exceptional educator and leader - not only on the operational side, but also in my values."
Maj. Gen. Haliva said that he would also examine whether to publish a picture of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from Sayeret Matkal, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and his picture was not allowed to be published.
The Khan Yunis operation took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of many months of careful preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
In the command of the operation were the then Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot, then-head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heymann and then-head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been released, and the IDF emphasized that it was an invaluable intelligence operation.
In the Arab media, however, there was a retrospective display of communications equipment that the Palestinians said the forces had left behind.
According to Hamas, the operation was aimed at planting listening devices.
According to reports, on the day of the incident, the force drove two vehicles.
The fighters were arrested at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas operatives, and something in their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The on-the-ground investigation lasted about 45 minutes, during which time it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair ad-Din managed to distract the Hamas operatives, and in a split second, the force commander, Lt. Col. A', managed to open fire.
Three Hamas members were killed in the fire, and unfortunately, so was Lt. Col. Hir ad-Din.
Ten months after the difficult incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the Tzalim Committee and to award the Chief of Staff a medal to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip - among them Lt. Col. Hir ad-Din.
The commander of the fighting force and another member of the crew also received a medal.
In a statement, the army said that Lt. Col. M. received the commendation for "his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, to protect his comrades.
Later, he acted out of initiative and striving for contact, took a forward role in taking control of the enemy and acted resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider switching from tweezers operations to an extensive operation
Israel must ask itself, again, if it is wrong to change its policy vis-a-vis the Jenin sector.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank, but the Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
The stormy weekend we went through shows that although Ramadan is behind us, the area is still more volatile than ever.
It will take great efforts and common sense to cross the next two commemorative days in peace: Nakba Day on Sunday and Jerusalem Day in two weeks.
Quite a few elements will stand by in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
They are headed, as always, by the terrorist elements, who are concentrating a special effort in an attempt to preserve the violent atmosphere of recent weeks.
This was evidenced during the arrest operation in which a SWAT fighter, the late Sergeant Major Noam Raz, was killed yesterday.
Fighters who took part in the battle in Jenin testified that they did not remember such a scale of shooting and violence - evidence not only of the huge amount of weapons in the field, but also of the willingness to use them.
This requires Israel to ask itself, again, if it is wrong to change its policy vis-a-vis the Jenin sector, and to move from small, intelligence-based tweezer operations to a broad, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena; even now, the defense establishment prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid fire, but the Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
To draw the lessons for future events.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims to have deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shirin Abu Aqla.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it and for those present at the scene.
The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of combatants.
This attests to high morality, but it also has an operational-intelligence value: a terrorist who was captured alive - as happened the day before yesterday in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about weapons, terror attacks and other terrorists; it is information that usually cannot be obtained in any other way, and through it it is possible to thwart the next attacks.
The IDF acted correctly when it published the interim investigation it conducted into Abu Aqla's death, and clarified that it was not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the affair.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terror - the original cause for which the IDF is constantly operating in Jenin.
As always, the nature of such stories perish.
World public opinion is preoccupied and is moving on, certainly as the war in Ukraine continues to rage much more intensely.
Therefore, it is a shame that Israel insisted on giving Abu Aqleh's death another unnecessary moment of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful treatment of her funeral.
Even if Abu "Aqleh's family did not meet the preliminary summaries, we should have expected a little more restraint from the policemen who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less to be moved by the Palestinian flags that were raised there.
The responsibility is to calm the situation.
The Minister of Public Security and the Police Commissioner ordered an investigation into the incident.
It seems to lack sufficient preparation and clear guidelines, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
In the attack in Dizengoff, too, the police failed in managing the incident, isolating the scene and handling the media.
The commission of inquiry will do well not only to analyze the conduct of the policemen at the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions that will enable better treatment of similar incidents in the future.
Alongside the internal treatment of the police, it is also obligated to pay attention to the conduct of elected officials who have lost their way and direction.
The Israeli Knesset currently has several members who appear to be a danger to democracy.
They are on the left and the right, and exploit their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kasif is the latest example of this; if no action is taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the state will implicitly encourage the next elected official to further radicalize his actions.
Such moves, which are a defensive democracy, are essential in the explosiveness of this period, with elements seeking to exploit the situation for political purposes in the background.
Anyone with common sense in his head is expected to rise above all these and act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel may quickly escalate against external enemies, and worse - against domestic enemies.
Police official: "We need government policy and goals"
The Israeli police have launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal aliens, but the road is still long.
There is not a single entity in the State of Israel that incorporates this entire issue. "
"If we want to deal with the phenomenon of illegal aliens, government policy is required, and from it we must derive goals, missions and responsibilities.
Today, there is no single entity in the State of Israel that integrates this entire issue, "a senior police official told Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, prior to the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon was expressed in some 20,000 to 30,000 illegal aliens who enter the fence every day through breaches.
In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day through 34 supervised crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each sector is limited by the quota set by the political echelon in accordance with the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, the ISA is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited as a result of criminal involvement or connection to terrorist attacks, but rather in many cases Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permissible permit quota.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were considered illegal aliens, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security officials to monitor their movements.
"Therefore, there is no significance to their entry through the breaches in the fence," a senior security source said, "Anyone who wants to carry out a terrorist attack can enter the country through the supervised crossings, and there have been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of numerous warnings of attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal aliens.
By the end of the week, 16,000 illegals had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were interrogated and criminal cases were opened, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the policy of the police prosecution, proceedings against illegal aliens are carried out only against habitual criminals or people who repeat the act over and over again (recidivism).
Illegal detainees detained for the first time are interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes this is repeated a second time, but only the third time he is arrested, imprisoned and indicted for unlawful stay.
According to the law, if an illegal alien is caught within a range of 50 to 100 meters on either side of the separation fence, his treatment is carried out by the military prosecution.
According to data obtained by Israel Hayom, in 2021 the police treated 40,010 illegal aliens, transporters and accomplices.
7,405 illegal aliens were arrested and 19,533 criminal cases were opened.
The number of employers, transporters and melons treated by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
"The foundations of the Shin Bet phenomenon do not depend on the police, the IDF, Israeli society or Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors, "says a senior law enforcement official.
"In order to deal with the phenomenon, their motivation to work in Israel must be sterilized, and on the Israeli side they must be charged a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the matter claim that the failure to charge the price stems, among other things, from a lack of places of detention and from the fact that the arrests are carried out only when there are incidental offenses or that the detainee is a recidivist.
Legal sources claim that the decision to charge a price from the IPS only began with his third arrest, partly because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests carried out every day.
Anyone who examines the punishment will find that it is not deterring. "
There is great complexity
A police official said, "He's a complicated man."
He can be a father of a family who came to Israel to work to earn a few shekels and come back.
This is the basic platform, and on it are dressed many types of illegals who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks. "
It can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, 16-year-old illegal aliens have been caught by the police, and even 8- and 10-year-old children are sent by their parents to intersections to earn a few shekels a day from drivers.
"It also makes it complicated, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and charge them with negligence," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed illegals in garbage disposal, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 passes, there are about 18 major ones.
There are crossings of vehicles and goods, there are crossings through which only people pass, and there are crossings that are both.
All the crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.
The illegal immigrants are usually transported into the country by private drivers, as this is easy money.
"There are those who do this for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is transporting illegals," says a senior police official, "Most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can cost up to $300 per person.
Registered companies do not deal with this, because if the company is caught, it will be closed. "
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting illegals can be considered a crime.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at regular points and at regular times, including an order, does not break the law," says a senior police official, "Anyone who knows he is driving an illegal alien, usually collects them in the dead of night at hiding spots, including downloading at hidden spots.
Most of these guys drive a half-assed car because they know we'll confiscate their car, so they prefer to drive an old car. "

"We need to open a criminal investigation against it": Haifa City Comptroller in serious charges against Einat Kalish Rotem
The city comptroller's report presents an alleged fear of criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former city officials and political opponents: surveillance of employees and inflated payment to an accountant's office for conducting investigations
"The report's findings call for a criminal investigation."
City Hall did not respond.
Surveillance of city employees and political opponents and inflated payment to an accountant's office for conducting investigations, "at the expense of the public coffers."
The report of Haifa Municipality Comptroller Ofer Tal, published on Tuesday, presents an alleged fear of criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former city officials, city employees, and political opponents.
According to the suspicion, Kalish met with the accounting firm of Barlev & Co. and requested an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under the names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to councilwoman Sofie Nakash, and we checked whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash's family were strictly kosher.
The comptroller's report also shows that there is disorder and a complete lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to coordinate and synchronize the works of the accountant and the municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant was not transferred to him.
This has led to the fact that no one in the municipality is aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and the scope of the work required in each of them.
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation was created in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved grew disproportionately, with great intervention in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and follow-up by the municipality.
To summarize the report, the audit recommended that the unpaid payments to the accountant be halted until material detailing his work on each of the issues it examined was received.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were under codes such as "gatekeepers," an information store, a fish store, an investigative audit of the mayor and a purchase investigative audit report.
Shortly thereafter, the city's attorney general, Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor herself signed the approval of the payment in her place.
"Not commissioned by any audit report and I am not aware of what this is about," she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit was about two million shekels, of which 1.5 million shekels were paid and half a million shekels remained to be paid, from the taxes of the Haifa public.
Former City Treasurer Jackie Vakim responded: "These despicable actions were done in order to tarnish the name and reputation of elected officials at the expense of the public coffers and the Haifa taxpayer and is a criminal offense."
In her response, Sofie said, "The comptroller's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves."
Attorney Sarit Golan, Haifa City Council member: The hard evidence and findings that emerge from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the investigative review consultant to carry out investigations, some of which are doubtful if they are permitted by law in the manner in which they were carried out, and in particular the investigations concerning the opposition council member and former senior employees. "
Lior Datz's response: "It seems that all the red lines have been crossed that a public authority sends investigators to collect information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption and while the association conducts public proceedings against the Haifa municipality's administration."
The city council did not respond.
The accounting firm of Judas Barlev does not wish to comment.
Gantz: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm UNIFAL's activity in Lebanon"
The defense minister participated in the international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their modes of operation."
Gantz referred, among other things, to Al-Sayed's documentation in Hamas captivity: "A video aimed at extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue"
The deputy commander of the 8200 unit revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke Wednesday morning at the Tel Aviv University International Cyber Center conference, where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to target UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country," Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hisham Al-Sayed, a Hamas captive in Gaza, released by the terrorist organization's military wing: "Yesterday, a video was released aimed at extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four sons captive in violation of international law, contrary to morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal conduct of Hamas. "
"The State of Israel is working with a variety of means, and continues to turn over every stone in order to bring the boys home.
As we have said before - this is a humanitarian issue, this is how we see it, and on this basis we will continue to act.
"Attempts at extortion and mind exercises will not affect our position and conduct."
"Iran is also operating its proxies in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recently the Iranian security agencies have been located in cooperation with Hezbollah in order to harm the activity of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This was done by carrying out a cyber operation aimed at stealing materials about UNIFAL's deployment in the area and using them by Hezbollah.
This is another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon and to Lebanon's stability. "
"Israel knows its adversaries" cyber systems and their modes of operation.
"We have seen in recent years a phenomenon of groups of hackers on behalf of Iran, who are working with Israel and other countries," Gantz continued.
"The'new emissaries' are terrorists with a keyboard who are condemned like the fighters of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we hurt them and their senders, and even today they are in our sights - and not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack on Israeli civilians will pass the agenda.
And the responsibility lies with the aggressors and the state that finances and sends them.
Cyber attacks can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and in other spaces. "
Gantz continued his attack on the nuclear power: "Iran is leading cyber terrorism - and is making moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and administrations, as happened in the presidential elections in the United States and in other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Operations such as that of the "Shahid Kava" unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under the direct directive of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in the investigations. "
He added that "in recent years we have blocked many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand "cyber responsibility," and to punish companies and entities that do not act in accordance with the guidelines. "
Gantz went on to highlight Israel's next goals in the face of threats: "Our supreme mission, in the army, in the various industries and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have placed this issue as one of the main tasks in the relevant units.
We examine the force's building all the time - both in terms of manpower, training and missions.
In the coming years, we will also need to examine the form of organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, with its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and in the entire defense establishment. "
Finally, the defense minister concluded by calling for cooperation with the world: "Our cooperation with the world vis-a-vis Iran is of great importance in the cyber dimension as well.
The same cooperation that we are building in the region with Iran in terms of defense against various threats - we are also expanding the cyber dimension. "
The deputy commander of the 8200 unit revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems."
Uri, deputy commander of the 8200 unit, said in the unit's first public appearance at such conferences, he revealed that Israel had foiled an attack on the water systems.
"Preventing cyber threats is a key part of our operations.
"Our goal is to gain supremacy over the attacker, to be able to identify him and to act to negate his abilities," said the deputy commander of 8200, adding, "So sometimes we also find victims outside Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and by collaborating with industry and other agencies, through the application and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed. "
"We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them several years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a certain adversary had attacked Israel and in the process identified that the adversary had also tried to target power plants in the United States.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We succeeded in preventing this threat through close cooperation with our American partners. "

Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and its goal is to undermine the sense of security needed to manage the normal life of the civilian population.
The wave of terror attacks that took place this year, with attacks in Be'er Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who was assimilated into a crowd, led the police to think creatively about developing a tool that could train fighters to storm terrorists within a civilian population.
The work of thinking was led by the training wing of the police and the Border Police.
They entered the competition in the various police districts under the heading "Commanders Leading Learning," in which each district was required to develop measures that would help improve the policing and fighting skills of the fighters, policemen and commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need to train Border Police fighters in combat training in movement and in such scenarios, Asaf Ben-David, a guide for fighting terrorism of the Jerusalem Border Police, developed the "Asaf facility," consisting of a dynamic target, connected to a telescopic pole on which is a carrier that can be harnessed to the instructor.
Their servant guides the carrier to our death, he can practice the warrior standing in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Police fighters have dealt with many attacks in which the assailant carries out a shooting and poses a threat while moving in arenas saturated with innocent civilians.
"Assaf Facility," in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic rod that was upgraded and integrated into the facility was taken from maintenance and cleaning.
Using the facility, it is possible to simulate shooting in motion within a civilian population at a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling a traffic stopper, choosing a progress path, selective shooting, including practice of preventing harm to uninvolved persons.
Maj. Gen. Assaf Ben-David, whose facility is named after him, says: "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in learning and training fighters and policemen.
The development provides a relevant response to attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of development compared to the relatively cheap cost of production is a significant advantage for us in competition. "
The State Comptroller warns: "The Central Elections Committee is not prepared for cyber threats"
Netanyahu and Engelman warned during the International Cyber Week about Israel's unpreparedness to attack hackers
"World War III will be a hacker war, but the world is not prepared for it."
State Comptroller Matanyahu Engelman participated today (Wednesday) in Tel Aviv University's annual cyber conference and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
"We are exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it. "
Engelman said that in the framework of the cyber audits conducted by his office, significant deficiencies were found: "In the past year, we carried out penetration tests at the Traffic Management Center in Jerusalem, in hospitals and in the Tax Authority systems.
In the audits we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were carried out by public bodies and some of them conducted penetration tests only during the audit.
In addition, there were deficiencies in the preparedness of the Central Elections Committee for Cyber Threats. "
"We at the State Comptroller's Office are committed to continuing to address this significant issue with greater force, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world," he concluded.
"I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles."
"From the first moment I was shown that I was wanted, I was built to lead a large group."
Returning to Israel after four years: "I felt I had a place, I want to be in the EuroBasket squad"
"I've learned to concentrate only on what I can control.
Oz Blazer in interview.
Oz Blazer will travel today with the Israel national team to Poland, where they will meet the local team in the 2023 World Championship qualifier (Thursday, 21: 30 Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia in an entire team hall.
In addition to intensive training with the national team, Blazer spent the last week working on his future, until he signed for Hapoel Jerusalem for two years.
"I have a quiet mind now that I have found a group," he told Israel Hayom in his first and special interview since the signing.
"I have a little pressure now because I have to move with my family after we settled in the central region and it's not easy, but there are no phones anymore and professionally I'm much more relaxed."
You haven't been on the team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to enjoy the team and I come with an attitude of contributing as much as I can, whether it's from my experience or whether it's on the pitch.
Of course I'd love to play, but when you get to the national team, everyone has to put their egos aside and do everything to make the team succeed.
I'm here for what they need from me. "
Now you are 14 players, and the European Championship will be joined by Danny Avdija, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and there may also be other changes.
Do you want to be in the championship?
"I'd like to be on the field contributing."
The 29-year-old (1.99m) has played for Maccabi Tel Aviv for the past two years.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks moved to the capital, preferring the Jerusalemites to Hapoel Holon.
You had other suggestions, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
"They showed great willingness for me to be there, so it was relatively easy to negotiate.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I realized that this was the right place for me.
The situation is also good and appropriate.
I'm here to lead and be a part of the team.
I talked to the coach and he has a hard-working, winning mentality, and that's exactly what I bring.
I always loved playing in the Arena, because I get energy even with the crowd is against me, and now they will be on my side it will be even better.
I'm sure you'll be a committed and fun team and I wanted to be a part of that. "
Tell me a little bit about your conversation with Coach Dzikic.
"Professionally he believes in a lot of ball-less movement, he plans to bring good passers with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energy in defence and attack and with the crowd at the Arena it can be successful. "
I looked at your career and saw that every team stays for at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel that you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
"Wherever I go I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone never stopped ringing and beeping.
I've got a lot of messages waiting for me.
I think we're in for a good time. "
Do you think you could be a bigger player in the NBA than you are in the NFL?
How do you feel about the two-year-old?
"There were things I couldn't control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional all the way, and no matter how much I got - I always gave everything.
I'm proud of the way I did last year, and now we're going our separate ways. "
If it were up to you, would you want to stay on the team?
"After the past year, it was clear to both sides that we were going towards a breakup, but it's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I was a little hurt in the minutes and my status dropped, although in the middle of the year I had a great period, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized that this was less the place for me.
Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it. "
What are your goals for the upcoming season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the cup semi-final last season when I shouted to Ami Biton (Maccabi Tel Aviv's team manager)," That's what I'm here for, "so that's why I came to Jerusalem - to take titles."

All or nothing: 1: 1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but managed to fix it with a 10-minute equaliser.
He was subsequently ejected in red (74).
Hadera also remained with ten players following Red for the duty of Ido Levy (87)
The professional team of Hapoel Jerusalem counted well the amount of foreigners on the pitch at Teddy, much more than once, it should be noted, and at some point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was sent off).
This time, to their delight, all was well, and the 1: 1 they achieved in front of Hapoel Hadera will not be taken from them by the Association's court.
Before the Red had absorbed Hadida, he managed to score an own goal and equalise to set up a valuable point for Ziv Arya.
At the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida's private show began.
Falkuschenko raised the ball to the floor, and the midfielder stood up and headed back and the ball stopped in his team's net.
0-1 to her room who enjoyed a self-conflation gate.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida managed to correct and huge - Levkovich caught air and this time the midfielder headered to the right net and exposed.
1-1 to Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to register a second yellow and a red, this time after sliding towards Marmentini.
Daniel Bar Nathan decided on a dodgy red and sent the midfielder straight into an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Natan sent Ido Levy in the red and balanced the balance of forces on the grass as well.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon.
60: 85.
Ariel Beit Halachmi's team combined for a third consecutive victory, this time particularly impressive
Hoover and Hochman (15a) excelled
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey continued tonight (Saturday) with an impressive 60: 85 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a 3-0 season in meetings between the two.
Since falling to last place, Ariel Beit Halachmi's team has already won three straight, and in fact this is a surprise only for those who did not see the game.
We haven't seen such bad weather in a long time.
All this before the start of the series against Besiktas in the Champions Cup playoffs: only 60 points, a first half without a three-pointer and 11 percent for the entire game.
The bottom line is an unimpressive night for all the team's players (with the exception of Murphy Manco, who hit Holon's three three-pointers), including safe stock Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in good shape thanks to Roy Hoover and Joaquin Shochman (15 points each).
The first one came back in the last period and the second one came back to flourish and also stunned with a three-quarter-court basket.
Give Them a Chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv's Israelis Save Sfairopoulos
After losing the Derby and eight in a row in Europe, a defeat at the Clasico against Jerusalem - probably would have ended the long affair between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach
So who does Giannis have to send a bouquet of flowers to tonight?
His Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points in the Arena
Why the Yellow Club needs to change its "Americanization strategy," and take a living example from Ariel Beit Halachmi's model in Eilat
It is difficult to remain cynical at the sight of the tearful eyes and the warm and strong hugs that Giannis Sfairopoulos gave his players at the end of the game tonight at the Arena, and especially in the face of her tight grip and the secret exchange with John DiBartolmao, who single-handedly saved the Greek coach the job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after a home loss in the derby and an eighth consecutive loss in Europe, to lose also in the classics to Jerusalem and stay away from it to three wins in the table?
It would have ended the Israeli-Greek romance by tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also and actually mainly about the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change in offensive habits and moving the ball.
The ball moved with passing, with lots of movement and drills, and Scotty Wilbekin, demonstratively, left the craft of concentration to Evans, dribbled very little, and mostly passed over blocks and went out for shots.
Despite shooting very badly (9-2 from the field), Wilbekin contributed to the defense, and mainly, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
However, by the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team had reverted to old habits, and the attacks had reverted to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a 2-and-40-second lead to go, Scotty dribbled himself into a half-corner and threw Floater over one leg for nearly losing the game.
The trick is to keep playing drills and passing precisely in the clutch moments, and that has to go into nature and team DNA.
The important learning will be done by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
The ones who became water cleaners and towel-waving at European games.
Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them more than half of the team's points (42 out of 83), and were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of the top five scorers in Maccabi were its Israelis.
And don't say that Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.
In the first half, it was mainly Oz Blazer, who has been screaming for a month that he must play more.
Shooter, passer, fighter under baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.
Isn't that enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen starred, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and covering for Zzic's injury, and especially John Dee, who at 70: 63 to Jerusalem changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.
With Yiftach Ziv, Janis has a complex relationship, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and burdens him too much, to the point of losing.
It's also happening in the Euroleague, and it happened tonight.
But the important learning has to be the club's, about its Americanization strategy.
Fact: The senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ganat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or maybe was rejected by Maccabi.
And it happens that Maccabi gradually leaves fewer places for Israelis, because of an informed and rooted choice of the club to be based on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play with it, and then it will look for Jewish children to become naturalized, and pressure the director/union to further increase the number of foreigners.
This is a huge mistake for the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it exaggerates with the foreigners, much because of the tax discount.
It is certainly not claimed that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one planet and eight mediocre ones, you can have five great ones.
For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunally, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, it was possible to bring two stars (a star point guard and a super forward) that were effective and stable next to Scotty and Gizzich.
It will be more effective, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and generates identification.
It's true that there are two busy frameworks and a long season - so you have to rely on your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even receives tax relief from the state for its so-called representation in Europe.
The basketball association/league administration can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 on the form, maximum three on the field at the same time.
Is it for the ongoing failed achievements (already seven years in Europe), only for Maccabi, that the league is flooded with foreigners?
And the Players Association, how about you?
That's why you came?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there's one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargaining to get less?
The previous Russian rule was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if someone needed reinforcement for the above, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and 4 Israelis who were only second in the youth teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Roina and Shochman the fighter), it dismantled Holon (second in the table!) for the second time in the last two weeks.
It's a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run in the days of Dan Shamir and many in the days of Sharon Drucker.
Short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there's nothing like Ariel Beit Halachmi, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at the top of their game, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
Strangers are just messing around.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather come back from a knee injury, it'll be a great team.
A song I dreamed of.
The coach can learn from you in the right direction.
"It felt like the whole world was against us."
The Yellows are happy after the 78: 83 on Hapoel Jerusalem in the Arena: "We came back to play like Maccabi Tel Aviv should play"
About Ami Biton's conversation in the dressing room, the optimistic first diagnosis of Zizic's injury and the management's approval of the acquisition.
A great sense of relief was recorded this morning (Sunday) among Maccabi Tel Aviv after the important and prestigious 78: 83 yesterday in the Arena on Hapoel Jerusalem.
The team's players and management team hugged with coach Giannis Sfairopoulos, who looked very excited at the end.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer poured water with enthusiasm on Derrick Williams, who excelled in the game, and the rest of the club smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the last losing streak.
They, too, feared defeat in the face of the great rivalry that would further undermine the system.
The fans also had a few minutes to celebrate.
"There is an amazing connection between us and Giannis in the dressing room," said Oz Blazer.
"We know it wasn't easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We looked forward to it, the way we played.
We came back to play in a way that Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with heart and fight, we stand behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us. "
Before the game, team manager Ami Biton came into the locker room and said exciting things to the players.
"His words had a great impact on how we came out and how we played on the court," said Maccabi's players.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi is already aiming for the important game against Basconia on Thursday and wants to interrupt the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the last few games we were under a lot of pressure, Giannis told us that if we were released we would win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
We have a lot of eyes on us and it was a feeling of the whole world against us, I am proud to go to this war, we cut off everything around us and look only at ourselves. "
Ante Zizic, who was injured in his right knee during the last quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
Doctors will examine how the knee will react today and then it will become clear how many days of rest he will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Basconia.
Aside from the strong backing given by the management to Spropoulos and the professional team, at a meeting on Thursday, the professional manager Nikola Vujci<unk> was given the green light to bring one or two players to strengthen the team, and the yellows hope to add quality procurement soon.
Anthony Bennett has been released from Jerusalem.
First-drafted forward unable to acclimate to team from D.C.
"Anthony came into all of our hearts, thanking him for his time in Hapoel."
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released from the team's roster on Sunday.
The forward (28, 2.03) who was selected first overall in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers recorded 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five Champions League games and 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight Premier League games.
"Hapoel Jerusalem and player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision on the waiver of the player's contract at the club," the club said. "Anthony entered the heart of all of us and we would like to thank him for his time at Hapoel.
I wish him well and good luck. "
Study Says Zoom Meetings Harm Creativity
Some 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem - some in video sessions, some in face-to-face meetings.
The Result: Virtual Meeting Harms Creativity and Thinking Out of the Box
Columbia University research leader: "Visual focus on the screen impairs the idea-creation process"
Forte comfort: There is no harm to labor productivity or critical thinking.
A major scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of meetings through video programs on the creativity of their participants, compared to face-to-face meetings.
Unfortunately, creativity was found to be impaired in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question - led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University - was whether remote computer-aided meetings preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free-thinking decreases as a result of remoteness.
The study itself began in 2016 but received a big boost in the two COVID-19 years, during which many employees switched to working from home.
"People in a personal meeting move around the room, use objects, and use them for creative thinking," Brooks says.
"In a computer meeting, however, the concentration on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which impairs the broad and expansive idea-creation process. "
Space is shrinking.
To test the results of the experiment and ascertain whether they would be repeated, they were tested twice - once at Columbia University and again in real life - on engineers who knew each other from an early acquaintance.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts - one asked the subjects to meet in person and develop solutions to the problem, and the other asked them to do so through a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to share similarly and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, there was a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher on ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people often look at their surroundings to help them create ideas, while in a video session, thinking converges on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.
"When the people in that room look around them and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can awaken new associations in them.
In contrast, the research shows that computer-based relationships change our attention so that we are more focused on the inside and the screen, and this way reduces innovation and the creation of ideas through looking at the environment and thinking out. "
No harm to critical thinking.
However, before managers run the employees back to the offices, the researchers note that "working through a computer did not harm productivity itself nor people's critical thinking about innovative proposals when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
In other words, the harm is focused solely on creativity and not on other forms of computer work. "
Professor Ellen Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also qualifies the findings.
"There's a difference between mere creativity, like new uses for Frisbee, and work solutions.
It's also possible that when employees are more relaxed after dating, or when they work from home, creativity will improve. "
Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson have also proposed a future study in which such meetings would be stopped for thinking situations and roaming the room to see how this activity would affect the final outcome.
Dr. Olson also suggested that, following the study, only brainstorming sessions would lead to employees returning to work, and as a general rule, he suggested not to be alarmed by a single study, but to carry out another study in the field.
"I wouldn't want employees to be forcibly returned and unhappy," he said.
Musk is waiting for Trump to return: "It was wrong to block him"
Twitter's new buyer said he would reverse the decision, which led to the blocking of the former US president's account
"I think it was a mistake," he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter in a deal valued at $44 billion, said Tuesday that he plans to return Trump to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after riots from his supporters on Capital Hill after losing the election to Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake, "he said.
"If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or rendered invisible, and a suspension - a temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban," Musk said.
By 2050, the world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture.
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years
The Solution: Proper Management of Water Reservoirs
A disturbing new study published recently in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050 the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and the growth of the world's population remain in their current usage trends.
In the study, which included scientists from all the world's scientific agencies, the scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to the need of humanity for agriculture.
The study's bleak conclusions show that currently the rate of water consumption has been doubling again and again in the last 10 years, while global warming is causing a decrease in rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the research data, 84% of the land designated for agriculture in the world will experience a severe shortage of rainwater.
One of the main conclusions of the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and the seasons of the year, and to switch to cultivation methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the process of evaporation of water that will lead to widespread waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater collection technologies to prevent it from flowing into the sea.
Information on many Bar-Ilan University students leaked online
Hackers who attacked the Bar-Ilan University database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about the students if they did not receive a ransom.
The threat was implemented and the information was posted online.
Students at Bar-Ilan University are under attack when their personal information is published across the network by a network attacker known as Darkrypt, who published a ransom demand a few weeks ago from university officials and threatened that if he is not paid an unclear amount of money, he will publish the information under his control.
Estimates of the amount of money demanded by the assailant are that it began with thousands of dollars and as the clock went up, it went up and before the information was published it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are full of angry messages and the mess is there, with students unable to access their personal information systems and unable to perform regular student assignments.
The university sent an e-mail to the public stating that the academic institution had been attacked and that they were working intensively to minimize the damage, while detailing some of the information leaked to the network.
No special instructions were given to those whose information was compromised and it was said that the university carried out a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's servers.
In line for 40 settlements: fiber optic reaches Benjamin
The trend of fast internet networking in the periphery continues and now the fiber optic is reaching the Binyamin Council, which includes 40 localities
The project, in cooperation with the council and the telecommunications companies Telran, X-Fiber and Rimon Internet, will be launched immediately after the holidays.
Over the weekend, the Binyamin Council signed a broad agreement of its kind for laying fiber optics in all the council's communities.
The agreement with the NetFiber project in cooperation with Rimon Internet, Telran and X-Fiber was signed after the conclusion of a large tender they had worked on in the council in recent months.

We checked: What do the side effects say after the COVID-19 vaccine?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weak, feverish and tired after receiving the injection, while others feel nothing.
Could this indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these phenomena, or is it a baseless rumor?
As more and more people become vaccinated, the lack of information about the side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are untrue.
Is the immune system of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies reacted less harshly to the vaccine, which might prove that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body entering the body?
"There are several levels of responses to the vaccine," says Dr. David Dvir, head of primary medicine at Meuhedet and a member of the advisory committee of the LCCM (Epidemic Treatment Team), reassuringly: "Headaches, fatigue, pain on the spot, these are the immediate responses of the immune system.
This is how the body reacts when a foreign body enters the system. "
Is there a correlation between the levels of antibodies that develop to the side effects?
"There is no correlation between feelings and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 60-50% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
People who have developed strong responses have not been found to be more protected. "
"In the medical literature, there is no correlation between immediate response and the level of vaccination.
In some trials where people were also given placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It is also a mental component - how the person perceives the vaccine, if he expects there to be side effects.
Many of the phenomena that happen could also happen normally, but because the public has been vaccinated it attributes the reaction to the vaccine itself, and this is a bias that you see with regard to vaccines in general - attribution of phenomena that happen close to the vaccine and are attributed to it. "
According to Dr. Dvir, the reasons for the reported common symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions are divided.
"There are all kinds of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One theory is that it's a strong immune response. "
Is it even possible to assess the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, it was shown that those who did not sleep or were under higher stress were more susceptible to infection.
Besides, there are laboratory parameters that check the immune system or its components.
When there is a decrease in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like anyone walks around with a weak immune system and doesn't know it.
These are people who come to inquiries because of recurrent events of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want too strong an immune system, because it can cause autoimmune diseases. "
MRNA vaccines will soon appear in other contexts, thanks to the great knowledge that has accumulated about them in recent times.
"There is no doubt that other vaccines of this type will be opened.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines - for treatments for oncological diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance remains very little time in the body - enters, does its action, and then decomposes.
This technology is not new, but it has received a serious boost due to the very great need for a fast vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week interval between doses is too small, and some of the vaccine experts claim that after a third dose we may not need another vaccine in the near term, so it is not clear whether we are going to be vaccinated every six months or the third dose will give a larger interval. "
Thousands injured in serious privacy failure on Route 6
Route 6 customers?
Your personal information, including your full name, addresses, payment amounts, and full travel information may have been compromised.
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
After a report by Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6 in Israel, about a security incident that took place at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement process.
As part of the incident, security vulnerabilities were discovered on its payment site, which allowed the exposure of a lot of information from the invoices of the member's clients, which were exposed to all eyes.
Among other things, the customers "payment invoices were exposed over a period of time and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, location of the vehicle, dates of travel and at what times.
In addition, since Derech Eretz did not record as required by law the access to its systems, it is not possible to know exactly for what period unauthorized parties could access the company's systems.
In the infringement letter, which was forwarded to the company by the Privacy Protection Authority, the authority emphasized that most of the large companies and organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that as threats and risks develop, the organization must carefully examine the updated risks and act in accordance with the update of customary security measures under the circumstances, in accordance with the nature and nature of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations are obligated to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and intrusion tests in order to examine and prepare for the changing risks.
In addition, companies and organizations are required to use an automatic documentation mechanism and to conduct trainings for employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Protection (Information Security) Regulations.
In accordance with the findings of the Supervision Department, the Authority determined that the company violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations, and demanded that the company perform a number of corrective actions.
From Derech Eretz, Highway 6 operator said: "The issue was dealt with in accordance with the most stringent requirements"
Travel warning to Istanbul: surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change their destination or date of flight
For Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: airlines will allow to change the flight dates.
Reminder: Earlier this week, the Anti-Terrorist Headquarters raised to level four the severity of the travel warning to Istanbul.
This is the highest level and means "a high threat level: this country should not be reached and in case of a stay leave the country as soon as possible."
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus said they would allow Israelis who booked their flight before the departure of the travel warning, i.e. before 13.6.22, to change their destination or flight date.
It's for the airline.
Tourism Minister Razvozov said: "Israeli citizens should not pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
I am pleased that major airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request, and I hope that other companies will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey because of the severe travel warning. "

Saudi skies are approaching: Israeli companies are preparing to reinforce lines to the east
The coming conclusion to an extended flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of European destinations
Israel's largest airline is planning major changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we published in Israel Hayom, it is estimated that Biden will announce approval for El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the UAE.
The agreement means that El Al will be able to fly on shorter routes to the Far East and Australia.
To do so, the company will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations in order to evacuate planes to new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations with a large Jewish population, but at this stage they are less profitable for society.
In contrast, El Al's new destinations are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
The Dreamliners flying to Canada will be released for long-haul flights to the east.
The Boeing 737 that flies to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred for use on flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which EL AL operates flights using the Dreamliner aircraft.
So, in effect, the company will be able to release large planes to fly to additional destinations in the east.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks about the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to return to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Exemption from isolation for the vaccinated and recovering from non-red countries, foreign tourists are returning.
Landings in Israel received notices from the Ministry of Health that they are exempt from the isolation requirement upon receiving a negative response to the COVID-19 test
Only later did the ministry issue an official statement that it was only passengers from orange countries, although returnees from red countries also reported receiving the notice.
In addition, tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
In the midst of a pandemic - the end to quarantine?
The Ministry of Health sent notices to the returnees Monday morning, stating that they are exempt from quarantine upon receiving a negative response to the COVID-19 test they performed after landing in Israel.
They also come from red states.
Some of the messages sent informed the returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative reply or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative reply.
It was only after that that the Ministry of Health issued official notices stating that as of midnight, 4.1.2022, vaccinated or recovering, those returning from orange countries will undergo a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and will be quarantined for 24 hours or until they receive a negative result (whichever comes first).
The decision will be anchored in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be submitted for the approval of the Knesset Health Committee.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovering persons who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from their PCR test at the entrance to Israel, will complete their isolation at midnight and are not obligated to perform a second test.
However, travellers from red countries reported that they had also received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered from an orange country will be placed in home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening isolation with a negative result in a pcr test performed from the 7th day of landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to lift most of the restrictions on flying, and especially on the vaccinated, comes a day before the High Court of Justice hearing submitted by the Travel Offices Association, the Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotels Association.
In tomorrow's hearing, the petitioners are expected to demand that all other red states be removed from the list, with Professor Itamar Grotto backing them in his opinion.
Strangers can also come in.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transportation agreed that as of Sunday, 9.1.2022, vaccinated/recovering foreigners (according to the Ministry of Health's definition) from orange countries will be allowed to enter - this is subject to filling out an online form in advance, performing a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, performing a PCR test at the entrance to Israel and then entering isolation for 24 hours or receiving a negative test (whichever comes first).
Unvaccinated/non-recovering foreigners (according to the definition of the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red states, except those whose entry was approved by the exceptions committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Teams will not be renewed at this time.
What about red states?
The Committee for Classification of Countries in the Ministry of Health recommends that the government remove from the list of red countries and transfer to the list of orange countries: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries currently remaining on the list are the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option being considered by the Ministry of Health is to exempt vaccinated people returning from red states from isolation.
It is currently unclear whether there is any connection between the messages received this morning by those returning to Israel and the guidelines that may be received by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
The Health Department has not yet responded.
The sky is beginning to open: the Ministry of Health is changing the restrictions on the gates of the country
Vaccinated persons returning from orange countries will be subject to 24-hour isolation.
The United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates will be red.
After long weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which it was possible to fly without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were forced to quarantine, alongside the ban on tourists entering Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend abolishing the three-day quarantine requirement for Israelis returning from orange countries.
So far, all vaccinated or recovering according to the definitions of the Ministry of Health who returned from an orange state - have been charged with isolation for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Now, the isolation that the vaccinated and recovering returnees from orange countries will have to undergo is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of the COVID-19 tests that are performed after landing at Ben Gurion Airport (whichever comes first) are received.
A person who is not vaccinated or recovering will nevertheless be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two coronavirus tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if he returned from an orange country and even if he returned from a red country.
A vaccinated or recovering person returning from a red state must also be in full isolation.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to be approved by the government, includes the United States, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, with the exception of Turkey, the average number of positive visitors to Israel in the past two weeks is more than 5% of the total number of arrivals, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase among patients from Turkey is rapid, the rate of positive return from Turkey is just over 4%, so it was decided to add it to the list of red states.
The most prominent countries to be removed from the red list: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, as of 9 January, tourists vaccinated according to Ministry of Health requirements will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, similar to the conditions of Israelis returning from an orange state.
In this case, too, the decision is subject to the government's approval, which will discuss the matter in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the Health Ministry's recommendations in this area.
The tourists against the restrictions.
The Association of Travel Offices, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association filed a petition to the High Court of Justice to cancel the restrictions on flying.
The country lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but left eight significant countries on the list of red states.
At a hearing in Jerusalem this morning, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red states.
The person who will support the petitioners "position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razbozov, who in recent weeks supported the easing of restrictions on the entry of foreign tourists to Israel, said yesterday: "The cancellation of the isolation for vaccinated people returning from abroad and the return of tourism to vaccinated people is the right and just thing to do during this period.
I thank my friends in the government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighs the benefits.
Vaccination is the best response to the epidemic, and as such - the vaccinated public deserves to conduct an enabling routine alongside the COVID-19. "
At an investment of NIS 200 million: the new resort to be opened near Arad
Another luxury hotel is expected to open in three years.
Chef restaurants, private pools and 110 rooms are just a fraction of what the hotel will offer
All the details in the article
Fattal's 7MINDS and the White City Buildings real estate company have jointly purchased a plot on a 20-dunam depot in the Judean Desert, where they will build a luxurious resort at an investment of NIS 200 million. The hotel will be built on the same area where the Masada Hotel was built about a year ago.
The resort will not open for another three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three shared pools, a spa, chef restaurants, a recreation area, a gym and more.
The person who will be responsible for the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ran Shmueli from Claro Restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one to build the menu, which is expected to have a unique desert concept for the resort.
The mayor of Arad, attorney Nissan Ben Hamo, welcomed the project: "The decision to build a new and prestigious hotel near Arad gives the official stamp of approval to the amazing rise that Arad has made in the field of tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the choice of the entrepreneurs and am convinced that it will be a joint success because Arad has tremendous tourism potential. "

" cHFFFFFF <unk>
Israel's largest airline has reported an increase in demand for flights abroad since yesterday's announcement of the significant easing of flights.
The company decided to publish a special sale this morning to mark the opening of the skies, and the prices it offers are considered particularly attractive.

Almost everyone nowadays has a tablet or an "old" smartphone lying in a useless closet.

You don't have to be the victim of a consumer culture and you don't have to always be at the forefront of technology, with another really useless gadget.
Collecting data without analysis.
Pity.
It was more interesting to hear how many people received pensions at the Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the centers of the requested cities) is worth, and how much the wages of the workers (minimum).
Israel Post should not be privatized.
How many packages arrived and how many were distributed?
How many people have disappeared.
They order packages, and they disappear at the Modi'in Sorting Center...
There should be a 5-NIS package tax that won't just order nonsense and load the mail
This is primarily indicative of the cost of living in the country.
Thanks to King Pacim for making it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to get close to the mail and hope that letters will not come from them and the hatred of the mail has led us to give up everything that belongs to the possibility of mail.
Good week.
Fire all postal workers, and start to reestablish the post office - by a private company.

You can see that there are professionals at Maccabi-Blatt and Katash.
Personal abilities may not yet compare to the Scotsman but a team player, and especially a much higher game intelligence
So sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv is relying on foreigners and the Israelis are warming the bench
By the way Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners and therefore will not succeed with all the stars that have scratched from around the world
Who cares???
If you are already watching a game in which 6 American players and 3 Israelis for decoration, isn't it better to watch a Golden State game???

Loved.
As for the Israelis, he's right!
"We saw last season that he's a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the EuroLeague he can't be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost confidence (and it's no wonder after the treatment he received after 2 bad games in the EuroLeague, as if foreigners didn't have such games) and his use may also be wrong, and it's a result of the coach's fixations and blunders.
Blazer is not a shooter with all due respect...
Jephthah Ziv shouldn't be in Maccabi Tel Aviv He's destroying it too
There used to be no good game but Sorkin and Blazer Dodi and Cohen today well done.
I'm sorry to hear that you gave him a $500 bill so he's writing nonsense.
The picture's not Federman.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jack Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor in Europe, who play for about 20 minutes and can't shoot a basket, who needs foreigners on a level of nothing and nothing, much better than the Israelis.
It's good to have a good spirit for everyone. Coaching players and management at the mamontum.
Depending on the internal...
and required disciplinary reinforcement of a point guard
And that's the management part.
Not true.
Human interaction is very important in many ways.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is also a bad thing from the professional aspect and the truth, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
Turn off the camera and solve the problem.
What happened, the researchers used zoom and so their creativity wasn't enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years?
Someone has missed an important detail.
The scientists don't care about warming or rainwater.
They only care about population growth.
They're working on more and more vaccines and bastard methods to destroy the world's population. So they're telling us Foggy stories about warming and other nonsense they're making up.
There's nothing wrong with desalinating water in unlimited quantities.
They said that 50 years ago.
Meanwhile, there are more people.
The solution is to restrict fertility, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the rest of the leftists are anti-state, and in all religions that believe in the gods - the stupid, the ignorant, the foolish, the blind, or in short - the herds.
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living creatures (also sasmolens) consume oxygen and report carbon ejectors.
The solution: Suicidal people, commit suicide!
It's green.
Never good.
May it be better for you, and certainly for Earth and for all of us.
Who are the scientists and how did they do the research?
I don't believe every study that talks about climate warming because this thing doesn't exist.
He has tended to control us and usurp our freedom and freedom.
It's all part of the new world order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side like he did during COVID-19.
I have never heard from him a presentation of facts from both sides He always brings the side that serves the globalists.
We're being bent.
They're just burning money on academic "bullshit" studies.
As usual, more bullshit from the land of psychotic sasmolens.
The situation is actually improving. Human knowledge is expanding, along with new technologies and improvements.
For centuries, the world's population has been growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only improving.
The Chinese, for example, launched a huge war project in the Gobi Desert, with incredible success.
The Saudis are doing the same thing and are also succeeding (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It's actually the stupid "climate crisis" of the sesmolens (carbon dioxide emissions, needed for plants) that is causing the Sahara to become greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the sesmolenian agenda, so you won't read about it in the newspapers...
The leftists don't worry.
In them the urine goes straight to the head and so they do not dry.
Does proper management of reservoirs mean a reduction of at least 70% of the world's population?
It is amazing that COVID comes and it is amazing that most of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose implications for the 5-25-year term for the injected are not even known.
It's also amazing that the 2030 Agenda is underway and now this?
I'm really surprised at the whole story!!
What a load of bullshit.
Thousand and One Nights stories, all intimidation and of course nonsense of the left trying to control the world through media control, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years.
They said that in Israel, too, there is no more rain and the drought is constant and there is rain.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena, and that Peres did not know that children of Yemenites were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not rob antiquities, and Ezer Weizmann did not mess with his soldiers.
It is clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting bullshit.
We're on a roll, we're on a roll, we're on a roll.
"This is real Zionism," as the opening of the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
Following the crook Bennett, the rest of the cocky politicians will draw a line.
Even if you give me free flights, I won't go near El Al, more like "Lock on"
It's been a pleasure. Goodbye.
You won't see me in my dreams.
Another great shame, we in Israel are captives of ELAL all direct flights in its hands pigs prices better you go bankrupt already, it's time for really open skies.4
Some are focusing on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows Elal to fly over its territory, it will not add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big game changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, acquisition of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa via Jordan to Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the UAE, tourism allowing Israeli companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
That's a lot more interesting than 30 planes a week that would save an hour each.
It is more important that the air force squadrons be stationed in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran, and that the Bahraini Emirates, Egypt and Morocco be organized to constantly arm Iran for a month until all its military infrastructure is completely destroyed.
And another squadron of the air force to settle in northern Saudi Arabia and beat the Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq to the east from a less crowded area.
After we're done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti and the Comoros into a peace deal with Israel and get a majority of Arab League countries to join the peace process.
After the change of regime in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdogan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia topple the government in Qatar and finally eliminate the subversion of this country and its support for other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these shared interests are over, it will be possible to talk about a few more flights of El-Al, if El-Al will survive until then.
El Al needs to close.
They sell tickets for flights that don't happen.
The worst is that there is no way to get a representative.
"There is no customer service."
Anyone who buys a ticket at EL AL and wants to change or cancel will forget about it, a sure loss.
You've been warned.
Air Canada is better.
They prefer to fly in streams.
Arkkea has gone from corporate shit to corporate hell.
El Al is down too.
Best call a cab.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
You took the train to the field.
A <unk> 40 suitcase at Ryanair is much cheaper than Wise.
An 8kg backpack can be loaded.
Why are you misleading?
Wizz Air on cargo and seating takes a lot more meaning!!!
One big crock.
Just for example, I just got back from IAAF.
Allowable weight is 30 kg.
7kg Trolley
Each additional 1kg is $30.
Get informed.
All the companies are stealing the client.
They advertise very cheap prices, but in the end it's a bag the size of a school bag.
A trolley costs money and a suitcase costs a lot of money.
It's a good thing the companies don't ask us to fly in our underwear and undershirts so there's no weight on the plane.
At EL AL, the price is not cheaper, but 50% of the cost of booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
Israelis are not surprised.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, in a successful manner.
A country that eats and eats.
To this must be added genetic stinginess.
Shame on our country for letting foreign airlines fleece the Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does as he pleases.
What did you learn today that it's not enough to pay for an expensive ticket?
We all had a surprise.
Pay extra for the wheels of the plane, for the windows, for the luggage that doesn't come, for the food, for the drink, and probably add on the toilet.
Stay at home and prices will drop.
Get out on the ships.
The journey takes a few days.
Wake up, and you'll probably come.
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and harm Israel, and still win the support of his new fans.
Open it now?
It's no accident.
It's just that when the mess starts, there's an exemption, it's just crazy what happens here...
It's not the peak of the epidemic.
Shimon, it doesn't suit you
The number of verifications does not mean that the number of patients increases
Stop getting checked for any nonsense, sit at home if you don't feel well
End of story.
A government of idiots.
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
Especially stupidity.
Confusion of the public 0
Only more damage than trickery.
Suggest you open a new corner: "The number of daily and cumulative deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The faces and the pictures behind the default. "
Your ratings will soar.
You do not understand the Minister of Finance for not paying compensation to tourism workers
Bringing more adhesion
They don't care about the people.
8,500 have died so far.
Is something talking about that?
They bury us, especially the elderly.
We became Russia/North Korea.
If you don't talk about it, it doesn't exist!
The main thing is that the citizens will put money into the state treasury to raise the ministers' bellies and buttocks!
Apparently Doberman and Abbas are the prime minister!!
Very well, the omicron delay was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half the people, and there is no point in trying to stop the omicron - which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, they're statistically less dangerous than whoever's already here.
This is the first time I have seen reasonable steps taken by the Israeli government to combat the coronavirus.
As if someone had actually sat down and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi - did what he thought would look better in the newspaper (and failed on all counts).
Government at its best:
A finance minister who tells road teachers to find a new profession two weeks ago is going to open the sky to tourists.
Minister of Education Maciasha beeps the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and sets her own policy, which throws all schools into complete chaos!
A foreign minister, a clown who gets sick in Corona for a cabinet meeting.
And the clowniest prime minister we've ever had in the country is out of control and freaking out like the last of the hooligans.
It's just a government with no leadership. We have no direction. The entire people of Israel have lost faith in it.
Go home an hour early!!!
Maybe it's coming from a bad place, but from a bad place.
Now the apartment prices there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Where are all the weathermen?
Build a bus station and believe it will affect all homes.
Except for protection money after.
The price of the hotel will return to be a white elephant like its predecessor.
Looks amazing.
Lots of luck.
I feel like it.
What about photographing naked?
Give up the rubbish.
SERIOUS FATE FOR SID BRIER
Why don't they give benefits to girls in the Galilee occupied by the Muslim Brotherhood
EVERYBODY CLACKENS
In the present reality, the South is still ours?
Need a Passport?
Another luxury hotel!
My friends will be there too!
What about a folk hotel for a folk person?
Good work in the south.
Arad is developing and thriving and all due respect to the mayor who since the beginning of his term has exploded for the good and glory of the city of Arad
Cultural life, society, education and more on the height
He's a great man who made the city better.
Well done.
I wonder how much protection money the Bedouin will pay the owner of the resort.
Have you made money for protection?
Wow, sounds good.
Those who can only afford to be on-company with the best service and security in the world.
When was I going to fly to Dubai???
Al's on a tin company.
Neither sociable nor economic.
In recent weeks she canceled flights back from abroad, you see, sent messages to the Israelis and told them that the flight was cancelled, ruined the whole trip on the spot, notified the passengers to leave a message on W.App or on Messenger and we will return, returned after a day or two or even three.
Trip's ruined.
Besides, is it better to ground planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to Israel, and prevent economic damage?
Are there any other idiots flying?
They don't fly for free either.
Have the millions of captive customers been returned yet?
EasyJet to Geneva round trip 70 euros.
EL ON ONE WAY $560.
From the deceitful religious who controls the company along with his fucked-up son I don't even buy for $10, nonstop deceitful...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be in addition to the price change.
Whoever buys tickets puts their money on the plane's wing.
A tin company.
Low cost drills.
No luggage, no choice of seat, certainly no taxes and no food.
Coronavirus vacations and flights...
To all the guacs... On me!
Nature dilutes fools!!
