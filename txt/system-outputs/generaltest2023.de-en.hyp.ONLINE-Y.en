Diego Cocca becomes Mexico's new national coach
In summer 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused trouble in the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs should encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The “Geesthacht blossoms on” campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. “Geesthacht flourishes” is an action by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the ground since 2015. Objective: In the Geesthacht urban area, extensive flowering islands are to be created, on which insects can find food at any time. “When the weather is favorable, bees fly out to search for food as early as January,” says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthachter Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the endeavor not only remains an action by nature conservationists and the city's environmental services, but also draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed on the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. In this way, passers-by should be able to find out what is blooming so beautifully here right now. The hope is that amateur gardeners will replant specifically at home.
The Wildhasel season started in the first week of January
More recently, shrubs such as winter cherry and winter snowball are in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the tubs on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, are just showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently received further signs. “The winter-scented cherry is a very broadly bushy shrub and can reach between two meters high and three meters wide,” it says there, including further information about the appropriate location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that, however, it is not only the bedding plants that are now showing flowers. The Wildhasel season began in the first week of January. It flowers particularly profusely on the Richtweg on the incline, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: “Stepping keeps me young”
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of them if he looked down from the sky at Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there at the “Mandolin Motion Show Academy” at 3 p.m. for a brisk tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102th birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh,” Monday is THE highlight of the week. “Dancing and tapping is my life, I can't imagine myself without it.”
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was rescued in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today you would say a musical performer, working with the legendary Marika Rökk. “I've spent my life dancing, acting and singing.”
At 79 years of age, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the group of tap dancers. She says: “We're just having fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl.”
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the wooden soles used initially, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced when dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French term claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a highly audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. “We are a big family, big and small, old and young are welcome here.”
And what is the recipe for such a long life? “The movement keeps me young,” the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: “Sport, healthy food and no alcohol.”
Analog in dialogue - The limits of the digital
As digitization progresses, some people are once again interested in analog
The rapid pace with which our everyday lives became digital left us with little time to set rules for dealing with them and to adapt our communication and working methods accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. You were either one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call their relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic hopper and the clicking of the small change coins in the vending machine will never be forgotten. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when I called - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has commissioned former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned unexpectedly. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was met with hostility from pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her “enormous sacrifices.”
Moldova is a neighboring country to Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, as it occupies 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the celebs' costumes
2023 will once again be properly celebrated in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities did not allow themselves to be asked for long.
Country father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume suggests. He sees himself more as Bayern's tribal elder. At his side, wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and Mrs. Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely aloof: Minister of Science and Arts, Markus Blume, is heading into space.
Landtag president Ilse Aigner chose none other than “Mama Bavaria” as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek and wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder alias Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She was wearing silver.
He even plays sheriff at carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann. At his side, his wife Gerswid.
On the roll: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to crafts with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same for him.
Of course, the political opposition could not be absent either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-boss Ludwig Hartmann as Bavarian lion.
Hiking is what SPD parliamentary group leader likes: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It became royal with FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, I'm sure he'll talk more. In Veitshöchheim, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime. At his side, Mrs. Andrea.
Should politics no longer work out, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg's OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermine.
Traveling quickly as a bee: Bavaria's Minister of Digital Affairs Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: BR Legal Director Eva Majuntke, BR Director Katja Wildermuth and BR Culture Program Director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side swipe against the climate activists by Franconian Tatort Commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The First Mayor of Veitshöchheim could not be absent, of course. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in the World Cup sprint
Boe continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has already collected 14 World Cup titles and continues to catch up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Cup gold medals. Even sometimes heavy fog did not prevent long-term winner Boe from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, it was already enough to successfully defend the title with Norway's mixed relay.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the pursuit, Boe is once again the clear favorite. Its running form is outstanding, so that it can compensate for shooting mistakes to a certain extent shockingly easily.
In the meantime, Doll didn't come together again. After the veteran had lost all chances of winning a medal at the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there was only sixth place, things didn't get any better three days later. Three penalties already in lying down and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago, he won surprisingly by 0.7 seconds ahead of Boe. It was one of only three of Dolls career successes that has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Olympic eighth in Beijing left without a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: “We must stand up for democracy”
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is primarily about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden insisted on maintaining democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
“The strong democracy of our two nations was put to the test,” Biden said at the White House in Washington on Friday. “We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength.” With regard to his right-wing predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, Lula responded: “Brazil has isolated itself for four years.”
The left-wing politician Lula prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1. The change of power was accompanied by heavy riots. Bolsonaro's supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is grim reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol a good two years ago, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor had not paid much attention to international relations. “His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening,” said Lula. “Sounds familiar,” Biden replied — an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF search posters? It looked at the members of the Red Army Faction, who had been approved for denunciation and shooting down.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was created against the most dangerous opponents of the Federal Republic of Germany; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstriped suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more after Raudis on the S-Bahn trains or masturbators in the park, is launching a new edition featuring the “war criminal” Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are perhaps more “Russian friends” in this world that Asia, Africa and Latin America belong to than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that's not the point, it's: In 1st to 5th place (!) Mrs. Wagenknecht stands, then Mrs. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I don't know anyone around me who reads this paper anymore. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the usual level, where nothing is lower.
And now at the latest, well dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And differentiation is no longer necessary here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have split up. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the “Bild” newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It states: “I can confirm that my client has filed an application for termination of his civil partnership with the competent court through his family lawyer. I won't comment on details.”
Glööckler and his partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, and there had been separation rumors for about a year. After participating in jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also talked about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved, a memorial center was set up in 1999. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended France's values, said Macron. He had also contributed to the Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had campaigned for Franco-German youth meetings.
A curve for 14 houses: Everyone knows everyone in Homeien
LZ series Nordlippische Weiler: In homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, residents will find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorbikes a day drive along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even drive right back again.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing believes that further interest rate hikes are “absolutely” necessary in the fight against the high inflation rate. “Inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs may rise again slightly, and the opening up of China may also give prices a temporary boost,” Sewing told the “Welt am Sonntag.”
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and promised a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher credit interest rates can result in investments being postponed and therefore economic growth being weaker.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for heavily indebted euro countries such as Italy. “The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries,” said Sewing. “Of course, we must keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt should not prevent the ECB from acting consistently.”
In the medium term, the ECB aims for price stability in the euro area with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. Although price inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce consumers' purchasing power because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply higher energy prices, which significantly drive inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will “collapse sooner or later,” warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federation of German Banks (BdB). “I currently see this as the biggest threat to the German economy. But I'm optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.”
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the “pace of Germany” for infrastructure projects proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). “There will need to be a political and social dialogue about this. And it may also be a bit more controversial,” he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that, in the end, a set of rules will come out which, although not necessarily as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation at the turn of the year, will not be as slow as before.
After ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened in mid-December. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply to a certain extent due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new “Germany pace” on the occasion. In addition, the Federal Government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
“First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that shouldn't automatically mean that we will always act so categorically from now on and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against their will,” said Hartung. There must therefore still be a process of negotiation as to what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, people have tried the classic set of rules and failed. “We should think again about whether the previous approach was correct. Perhaps we have overdone it with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves.”
However, in view of the many outstanding tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. “As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible.”
Union warns against dismantling of Bayer Group
Following an announced change of head at Bayer, the chemical trade union IG BCE is warning of the Group being dismantled. “From an employee perspective, Bayer, with its three pillars, is just right for the challenges of the future,” Francesco Grioli, member of the union's board of directors and Bayer supervisory board, told the “Rheinische Post” (Saturday edition).
This includes the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health sector with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. “The transformation of industry can only be mastered with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability — and not on hedge fund activism.”
The background is the change of head at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The former head of pharmaceuticals for Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been under criticism for a long time. The takeover of US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars, completed in 2018, depends on the manager. With the purchase, the people of Leverkusen had brought expensive legal disputes over the alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate. Bayer shares have been falling for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It was known for a long time that Baumann was not seeking an extension of his contract, which was actually supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors had put pressure on. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, such as Bluebell Capital, also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for the Group to be split up.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. Spin-off “of the Consumer Health division would be one possible way of increasing the company's value,” Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the “Rheinische Post.” On the other hand, he does not believe that a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science is feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
paris
On Saturday, too, the French want to take to the streets against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions oppose a government project with concentrated protest on the street. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform once again on Saturday.
Hundreds of thousands of people across France are once again expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform on Saturday. For the fourth time, trade unions are mobilizing against the central government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. More than a million people have already taken to the streets twice and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. There has been a turbulent debate in Parliament over the controversial reform for a week.
Many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid long enough for a deduction-free pension by the time they reach the age limit. In many demanding occupations, people could hardly work longer, say opponents of the reform. In addition, employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-earned pension and not completely wear out their health at work.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the pension level to be kept stable, the population would have to work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government doesn't just want to work on retirement age. The increase in the required payment period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1200 euros.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the corona pandemic, an initial attempt to implement the reform was canceled, and there were massive protests and strikes even then. A number of presidents before Macron tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - broad protest and strikes were certain of everyone.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Republicains, who have announced support. However, some of the MEPs - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And Macron's fear of crippling strikes is likely to be even greater than the fear of a close vote at the moment. Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility to ensure that they were calm and did not result in a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun at high altitudes
A huge high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that there is plenty of sunshine to be expected everywhere?
offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. “When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly above Central Europe immediately catches the eye,” explains meteorologist Markus Uebel from the German Meteorological Service on Saturday in Offenbach. “It is true that this high will shift a little to the east over the next week. However, it still determines the weather in Germany.”
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Uebel. “Such a high can even be pretty mean and give people in the lowlands dreary high-fog grey for days on end, while there is pure sun in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges.”
As a result, Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it can also rain a bit from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up over the course of the day and the sun appears more and more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or overcast. The temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, around 10 degrees near the Rhine.
“On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble on the high fog again and will be able to dissolve it more and more over the course of the day,” says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day; elsewhere, it must first fight its way through the blanket of high fog. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, around 11 degrees in the Lower Rhine, but only 3 degrees are expected in permanent gray in the southeast. In addition, weak winds are blowing from different directions.
On Tuesday, there can once again only be tough release of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be bright after fog has dissolved. According to forecasts, the sun shines all day in high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps. Depending on the sunshine, temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees.
Dominator struggles: Once again no World Cup medal for Goggia
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia has shown herself severely disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Meribel
“I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can,” said the Italian on ZDF after she had scored a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was barely able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill rider in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races of the season in this discipline. After gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, must continue to wait for a World Cup medal in her prime discipline. She was absent from her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
“I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was a matter of hundredths of a second,” said Goggia now after the surprising victory of Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. “I'm disappointed. I did everything I could. But that's life.” Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected and ultimately missed by all experts: “But they aren't.”
Girls missing in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station on Friday. The police are asking for information about their whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the population for help in the search for a missing child. 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children towards the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station at around 12:30pm on February 10, 2023. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of the German language and local language.

Zelensky and minister against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kyiv. By calling for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
During a joint conference call, it was agreed to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
“We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues,” said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place on the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. “And I have made Great Britain's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had previously protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. “While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions,” said Zelensky. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, even a neutral flag is ultimately drenched in blood and is not wearable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelensky called on officials to work to protect the Olympic principles and to prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which “unfortunately has lost its honesty.”
The occasion for the conference was the IOC's announcement that it would enable athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior is also taking a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior responsible for sport then stated that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it would reject the start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. “In our opinion, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sport to return to competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to resume Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong way to go,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior said in response to a DPA request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: “Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events don't take place in a vacuum.” Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated.
Russia and Belarus are currently excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is striving for athletes from both countries to return to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly subscribe to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that exclusion “because of a passport or place of birth” violated the prohibition of discrimination.

Lost half of the vehicles? : USA sees Moscow's tank inventory severely decimated
Lost half of the vehicles? USA sees Moscow's tank inventory severely decimated
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. We're talking about “half of the main stock.”
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. “Probably half of the main stock of tanks” in the Russian army was “destroyed or seized by Ukraine,” said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
At an online event organized by the Center for a New American Security think tank, Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed in US estimates.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Great Britain has promised Kiev that it will deliver Challenger 2 battle tanks for March. In a coalition with other states, Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The USA has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams battle tanks. However, their delivery is likely to take significantly longer.
Russia wants to add more
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin leader Dmitry Medvedev offered the prospect of building and modernizing thousands of tanks. “As we know, our enemy has begged for airplanes, missiles, tanks abroad,” said Medvedev, who is now Deputy Chief of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to an armored factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. “It is clear that in this case it is a matter of course for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology, including modern tanks.”
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more focused on the needs of the army. This can oblige individual industries, for example, to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil for filling posts at Heer
This is because the post that the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
According to the minister, a call for tenders is not necessary because the appointment is made to a previously unfilled job. She did not want to comment on “speculation by a liberal personnel representative.” Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these have been eliminated.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the Monarchy Wars, but the Institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the “unusual ordering process.” The decision is based on the “appearance of Postenschacher,” says SPÖ military spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to rescind the appointment. The ÖVP is “still stuck up to its neck in the corruption swamp,” said Douglas Hoyos, spokesperson for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools kneel before costs
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival procession. However, the higher security costs, among other things, are difficult to manage even in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kissling. The funds for this alone accounted for approximately half of the calculated total costs for the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The “Train of Happy People” in Cottbus, probably once again the largest in Eastern Germany, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. Even during the Swabian-Alemannic Shrove Tuesday, no parades were canceled.
Schleswig-Holstein's Marne carnival stronghold is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. “We are holding our event,” says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claussen. But financial concerns are pressing here too: If more sponsors were not found or the previous sponsors added even more, reserves would have to be affected - “that doesn't work every year.” The current deficit: around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: There is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent for sweets, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Carnival Procession Friends Association. Due to luck in misfortune, too many were ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear that the move will be more expensive. Security requires twice as many personnel as in 2020.
Anyone standing by the wayside on Rose Monday procession in the Rhineland could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants don't carry as much with them. Camels or not, the number of visitors is likely to be high: “I think that if it doesn't rain out of buckets that day, then we can certainly expect an increased number of people,” says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. “This is due to the fact that no regular Rose Monday procession took place for two years. There is, of course, no substitute for the train.”
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. However, the train is generally “loss-making,” that is no secret.
The Ukraine diary: dreams and homemade vodka
It is not for nothing that Ukrainians are considered to be drinkable. There is local beer, such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. I always discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other major breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't tell much of a difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely available. They burn it here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with it. But that only applies if it goes on sale en masse. There will probably also be adulteration there.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for their hard work: “Good match luck on our side”
Eating and drinking
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer after work, Rostock and Warnemünde are great places for that. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-heating for club parties. Where is it best? A look at Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed to the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot “Flocke”
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the award of medals in the Oberhof World Cup sprint. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
As hard as the Federal President tried, it was impossible to tell from the official gallery on Saturday whether the windows at the shooting range actually fell. “I had to get the results on my cell phone,” Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, referring to the fog that repeatedly swept into the stadium, which severely impaired the view on the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: “Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by the biathlon,” he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: “The refurbished arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say that too - thanks to those who have worked here since the World Cup was awarded.” In terms of sustainability, too, the location is now “one step ahead” of many others and therefore “safe for the next few years and even decades.”
Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Boe once again separated from the competition in terms of sport. Despite a penalty round following a shooting mistake, he secured the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawlessly shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Laegreid (1 penalty round/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters were unable to intervene in the battle for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth as the best German after a shooting mistake and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow scored flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed once again. After his failed mixed mission on Wednesday, the Black Forest left five windows standing this time and disappeared into the cabin as 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Boe started the race with number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and demonstrated this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, in his last two standing shots, he was lucky enough; they each landed on the edge of the windows and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his brother, who is five years older: “It feels the best to be here with him,” said the world champion: “We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes.”
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's pursuit. For women, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. “If you start with number one, the goal isn't to finish tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend number one,” said Sports Director Felix Bitterling, taking charge of his “locomotive.” The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25pm and 3:30pm/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych displeases “bee swarm” on the square
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on referee ball.
Aggressive players or grumbling coaches? Germany's referees want to “consistently punish” unsportsmanship. Referee chief Fröhlich points to a role model.
The top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in cooperation on the pitch. “I think that there are new players' behaviors that surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to push him into the review area,” the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. “We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to this again — and will also sanction it.”
Recently, two coaches had also received referrals. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow-red. “Coaching behavior also falls within the scope of unsportsmanship. We noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, and that behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanships,” said Brych.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out the generally good cooperation between coaches and impartial players. “Overall, the ratio is right. There are reactions, followed by consistent backlashes. The person concerned must then live with that. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering,” Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
“Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts over the course of the game. But if the emotion spills over into personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by referees,” said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved would have settled things out afterwards. “It would only be important if an overall rethinking process were to start, that such behavior simply is not appropriate,” said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out potential effects at other levels. “Of course, events from professional soccer always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, referees have consistently responded to negative behavior,” said Fröhlich. “Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying discussion with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected is always helpful.”
Combined team Oftebro wins in Schonach
After jumping off the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country skiing race, Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro secured victory ahead of Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia finished third.
The German combined teams are not in the best line-up in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. With training in Oberstdorf, they are preparing for the World Championships, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. “We have three world-class athletes at home. The team feels that, of course,” said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a police report, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a car driver hit a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed it onto two other cars. The complete closure of the lanes towards Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
Have created the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are a few extras for the finale.
The closing of the exhibition “Wandgebunden” will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 15:00 in the transition quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In each of the three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over and the works of art disappear. However, a catalog documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a presentation on wall-bound art in the service of the community. Using numerous pictorial examples, she presents the special features of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the lines of connection to this art form in the Federal Republic of Germany, with a focus on NRW from the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate on wall painting of the Weimar Republic in 2013. Since then, she has been researching building-related art and the history of art and institutions in the post-war period in Germany, most recently with Sebastian Freytag on architectural art in NRW. The presentation will be followed by the last curator's tour of the exhibition. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants following building collapses in Turkey
It concerns construction defects that have promoted the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in southern Turkey for possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. Arrest warrants were issued against 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing law enforcement officers. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have promoted the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was said. One of the accused was reportedly arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He allegedly tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine more people were therefore arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, an earthquake of magnitude 7.7 struck the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another earthquake of magnitude 7.6 at midday. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Second to last prime minister of the GDR Hans Modrow dies
Hans Modrow is dead, as announced by the left-wing faction in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Group leader Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED official and later PDS and Left politician as a “deeply sincere socialist.”
Last night, “Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95,” the left-wing faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is thus losing “an important figure,” explained parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch and former group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district management of the SED in Dresden. As prime minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for around 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost office a month later. He was succeeded as the last prime minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The leader of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a “profoundly sincere and militant socialist.” Bartsch added:
“He was an important advisor in our party until old age, whose wisdom will be lacking.”
“The entire peaceful process of establishing German unity was precisely one of his particular merits. That will remain his political legacy,” Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It goes on to say:
“His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always included representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated.”
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As stated in a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow viewed the new state “quite critically.” According to the DPA, German unity was achieved too quickly, the GDR collapsed too unconditionally, and too unilaterally it was condemned as an “unjust state,” according to the DPA, Modrow had criticized in many interviews.
What happened during the night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian rocket attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev — The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydropower plants were damaged, said the head of energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The situation is particularly poor with the power supply in the Kharkiv region. Because of the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block at the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production was cut at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the Russian attack with about 100 rockets and cruise missiles on Friday as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during its trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky doesn't want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24, there will be war for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger posed by Russian rocket attacks persisted even on Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, an air alarm was triggered for the fifth time for the day late on Friday evening. “There is a threat of an attack with drones,” the military administration of the Kiev region announced. Iranian-style combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa areas in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects advisors for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, from the election campaign to split them off failed due to the coalition partner SPD. The coalition agreement had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not have to generate and transfer any profits.
Restructuring backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms should help the federal government to accompany this process. The backlog of rehabilitation on the rail network is a major reason why the railways are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of remedying this shortcoming by completely renovating entire rail corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by the railways, however, they are more likely to amount to up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: “Can someone please pinch me?”
The external circumstances apparently did not speak for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had a bad night's sleep, she said after the race, was “really excited,” and her pulse stopped coming down when she arrived. “A race like that,” and that at the home World Cup, “you can't describe it in words,” she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming hit music with German flags, coaches and team hugged each other.
“Enjoy biathlon,” that was her goal
The pressure had been particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had started the World Cup as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick was the only German to win two World Cups this winter. She is currently in fifth place in the overall World Cup. And even though the power density among women at the top is significantly higher than among the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, there were others on the cards for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison in Nicaragua
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely tense since 2018. Back then, demonstrators calling for Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people died in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often out of fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Defence industry demands more orders from special funds
The first armament projects have therefore already been canceled, and further projects are threatened with the same, as the “Welt am Sonntag” reports. However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms. “There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to potential savings requirements right now,” says a response from the Federal Government to a question from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The reason for the falling investment sum is rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which was decided by the Bundestag in June 2022, must bear the interest charges for the loans itself. If these increase, there is therefore less money available for the specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the purchasing power of the remaining sum is falling as a result of the current high inflation.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured people
During the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 1:40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway exit towards Heilbronn onto the motorway. At this point, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving the B 19 towards Künzelsau, according to the police. When the BMW driver turned, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident was “green” for them. An inspection of the traffic light system revealed no complaints. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident. They had to be taken to hospital. The two cars suffered property damage totalling around 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart remembers the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many people from Stuttgart responded to the appeal of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. There is great sympathy - even in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disasters in Turkey and Syria are occupying the world. On Stuttgart's Schlossplatz on Friday evening, more than 200 people commemorated the victims and prayed for them.
Many community members had responded to the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the imam's supplication seriously and silently. In the prayer, the Imam Allah asked for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection against plagues and respectful treatment of one another. The community also asked for help and strength “to bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake.”
Ditib stands by the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the families of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial service. The supplications on Schlossplatz were also translated into German.
Muslims in Germany show great solidarity with earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Türisch-Islamische Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind on Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat insert - Ebersberg
“After dinner, you should rest or take a thousand steps “... The older people know the saying, the younger ones simply put it into practice. Either way, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because thanks to the home office, anyone who is not sitting in the middle of a rocky desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, woods and meadows, now uses the lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk out into the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around Lake Egglburg, where it's not just dog owners who are bustling around between 12:00 and 14:00.
One reason could, of course, also be that modern people can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things as part of optimal use of time slot. Because why not find out news about the settlement from the neighbor who hasn't been seen for a long time on a short walk through nature? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? It is also possible to combine work and private life in this way - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
Another excellent thing you can do is buy goods in kind. Fresh fruit, for example, which is on a roadside table with cheese. Or potatoes and meat. It's just stupid if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. For example, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voice. “Too bad, unfortunately we forgot the money.”
The disappointment can be felt, as you have a companion with a wallet yourself, but not a transport container. What you also let the friendly random acquaintance know. To which the man replies: “But that is not true! You certainly have a bag with you!” He points at the hood of the jacket, which you have quickly put on before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headpiece unnecessary. “My wife always packs everything in there!”
And so it happens that you start your way back with a meat insert and have not only gained the back of a lamb, but also an extremely practical idea during this short lunch trip. It is quite possible that a second walk will be required on this day - after dinner. Actually for digestion this time.
Trapped and seriously injured
At around 9 pm, the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road towards Hailfingen and turned right off the road in a left turn to the right, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guide post, hit the side of a tree and stopped a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. The emergency services took the seriously injured person to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of incapacity to drive, a blood sample was ordered to be taken. According to the police report, the Audi suffered a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: The tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in office as president of the USA
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the IRS to hand over the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the ministry's decision on Friday.
Contrary to political practices in the USA, real estate entrepreneur Trump had made his tax return public neither as a candidate nor later as president. He defended himself against surrender up to the Supreme Court. A public prosecutor in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a lawsuit.
Issuing it to Congress is probably more tricky for Trump: There, the number of people with access rights is somewhat larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information is also repeatedly leaking out of Parliament.
The leader of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a “victory for the rule of law.” Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. “The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as president,” Pelosi said.
Cabaret in Bastion: Life Plays Between Birth and Death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract with the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or?

Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about life situations in a humorous and thoughtful way. In her sensitive chansons and crisp, pointed cabaret songs, she gets to the point - and there are also a few things between the lines. It starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30pm at Kirchheimer Club Bastion.
British felon caught in Thailand after a long escape
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender from Great Britain has been arrested in Thailand. As the British Criminal Investigation Department NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police at a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the “Most Wanted” list of the most wanted criminals by the NCA.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled at the beginning of 2018 before the start of a court case in which he was sentenced to eleven years in prison in absentia for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).

Cabaret - Tales from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The studied physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, breaks a spear for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo “Make Science Great Again” fits in with this. It remains to be seen whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic scientific skepticism here. In any case, his sense of humor fits very well with Vienna.
By the way, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York as a stand-up comedian for a year in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can do — and above all not what it can do. There is corona, of course, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off: What is really important? All this with a huge wink, unagitated and very ironic. And so you are not only well entertained, but you can also learn something new in the process.

1. General
The BATTLEZONE one-man entertainment device is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game shows combat from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. There are rock pyramids and rock squads on the valley level, which offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble rockets, which are increasingly difficult to hit as the game expands. In addition, UFOs also appear at regular intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction process, the game initiation process, the game abl, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test process. The latter operating mode is a special procedure for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game process is triggered when the START button is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds are audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or rockets by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left information display angle of his cockpit. A clue may, for example, read: OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a dot is visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar blip sound, which represents the enemy position.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the enemy is in this area, he is easy to target on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMIES IN THE FIRE AREA are also shown on the upper left information display at the same time.
At times, UFOs become visible on the screen, which fly over the battlefield. These are safe missiles that monitor combat action and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player tank. The flight position of the UFOs cannot be detected by radar. The UFOs should round off the combat action and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or rockets. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. A kill by the player earns him 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and rotates twice as fast as the player tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several options give the installer the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game process. Furthermore, after reaching predefined scores, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a further more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the gameplay selector for this setting option are shown in the illustration.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum number of points in the table of highest scores, HE or SHE can enter three (3) personal initials in the table after the game is over. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Please note that when you trigger a self-test, press the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or interrupt the power supply, the table with the highest results is deleted. When deleted (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores will be received with their initials and re-entered on the screen to challenge other players. Any score above 100,000 is also marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically inscribe lines. The device then switches back to the attraction game process. ASSEMBLY ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with video devices from ATARI, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI gear lever. It was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly bring the control lever into the center position. The microshafts are now secured with self-locking nuts to make them easier to replace. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y gaming circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the analog vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in a uniform and quiet image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased energy supply caused by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. The device also has a console, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players to make gaming easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main components of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this symbol. 2. Equipment inspection
Once the packaging is removed, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should do a certain amount of verification to complete quality control. To be certain that the device was delivered to you in good condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V network yet. A. Inspect the outside of the housing for damage. For example, open the service cover of the device and check the components within the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for a correct and secure connection. Connect any open or loose plugs together.
NOTE: Never use force to establish plug connections. The plugs are fitted with forced guidance so that a correct connection is made. A plug connection twisted by 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the connectors to the game PC board for a correct and secure fit. (3) Note the device's serial number on the type plate on the back of the device. Verify that the stamped serial number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC Board, Auxiliary PC Board, Regulator/Audio II PC Board, and the TV Monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number is on the back of the cover of this manual. This number should always be given when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for correct installation. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with power supply and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also in the bright, orange-colored opening of the fairing. If the opening is not exactly centered, the cover, which is attached to the housing with adhesive tape, must be released and realigned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Figure 3) matches the local power supply. Check the color of the cable on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? The following are a number of tips that can help you solve most issues associated with current DirectX games. Verify system configuration
Please take the time to verify that your system meets the requirements listed on the package. You can use the DirectX diagnostic tool to get an overview of your system if you're not sure whether your PC meets the requirements. To launch the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, please follow these steps: Click the Start button and select Run. Type dxdiag in the text box. The DirectX Diagnostic User Interface is now displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphics and sound cards. Among other things, you can verify that graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound. Note: If you don't have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Before starting the game
It can happen that other programs consume the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious that they are active, and many start automatically when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on their system are also called “background applications.” In some cases, they can cause your program to hang or crash. We therefore recommend that you close such background applications before you start the game. - If your system is running antivirus or crash guard programs, you should close or disable them before you start the game. To do this, find the program's icon on the Windows taskbar. Right click on the icon and select the appropriate option (“Disable” “Close”, or similar). - Once you've disabled the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section “How to close all unnecessary background applications.” Clean up the system
Before you install software, make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to “clean up” your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need come with Windows: use ScanDisk, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Then there is a good chance that current games run largely without problems on your PC. A “clean” system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and therefore other applications that you use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to learn about the ScanDisk, or Error Checking, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click the Start button and select Help (or Help and Support) to access Windows Help. 2. Now click in the search box and enter the appropriate keyword, such as ScanDisk (Win 98/ME), Error Check (Win 2000/XP), Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup. You will then receive instructions that explain how to use these tools.
Is the game crashing or hanging?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure that you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website. The following are the latest graphics card manufacturers:

Note: Depending on your system settings, pressing CTRL, ALT, and DEL may not display the Windows security window, but the Windows Task Manager immediately appears. Windows XP Home
1. Hold down the CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press DELETE. The Windows Task Manager is now displayed. 2. To close a background application, go to the Applications tab, click the appropriate task list item, and then click the End Task button. Before you call the hotline
If you want to call, sit down at your PC and have the following information ready (see “Checking System Configuration” section). Please also prepare notes. - PC brand and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98; Windows® Me) - RAM (working memory) - Information about graphics and sound cards and drivers
INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
My desire to create video games was sparked by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up tons of new opportunities and appeared to me as a new means of expression that could be used to push the world to its limits. For me, it was an opportunity to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to discover - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too focused on “action” and forgot a fundamental element of the human experience: sensations. In the meantime, technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that transmits feelings. Even though this could of course have happened in a completely different way, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can certainly create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammo, but also has far more sophisticated and in-depth content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without sacrificing narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both diehard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help you change your attitude in this regard. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent, and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the opportunity to discover everything first. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, forcing us time and again to question many of the principles previously considered irrefutable. I would be lucky if Fahrenheit — like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you — doesn't pass you by without a trace either. David Cage
THE README FILE

Note: If your DVD-ROM drive is assigned a letter other than “D,” use it accordingly. 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish installing the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM. 5. When installation is complete, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar and select Applications/Atari/Fahrenheit/Fahrenheit to start the game. Note: The Fahrenheit DVD-ROM must be in the DVD-ROM drive before you can play.
This SERVICE MANUAL is intended to familiarize you with the installation and maintenance of the QIX TV entertainment machine. In addition to important information on installation and maintenance, the game process is described on the front pages. The subsequent service tips require general knowledge of microprocessors, TTL circuits and TV monitors. Without knowledge in these areas, no attempt should be made to repair the electronic device part. The electrical plans form the conclusion. We ask you to carefully follow the instructions in this manual to ensure satisfactory operation of the machine.
The information and illustrations contained in this SERVICE MANUAL are current at the time of printing. SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN LINE WITH TECHNICAL PROGRESS, BUT NO RETROFITTING OBLIGATION! Please note when setting up
Transport damage
If external transport damage is visible, it must be complained about immediately, recorded on a transport document and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railroad, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage! Line voltage
The device is set for the power supply specified on the type plate. For other network voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched over. In accordance with VDE regulations, the device is equipped with a protective conductor connection and is only intended for dry rooms. Proper operation of the coin system requires the device to be set up correctly and vertically. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor at any time, please switch off the machine for a short time (unplug it from the power supply) and then on again. If the device does not work properly afterwards, a repair is necessary.
Unplug it before repairing! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch the parts that carry the voltage! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still carry dangerous voltage. ATTENTION, HIGH VOLTAGE! There are about 20,000 volts at the anode connection of the picture tube. Only replace fuses with those with the same values! A blown fuse signals an overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced by a higher-quality one, serious damage can be caused. Only replace components with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuits/connections when the device is switched on. QIX SERVICE MANUAL
gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. An attempt must be made to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game process is set in such a way that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX are shown by red timing lines. If the red lines meet, additional SPARX will be released. When alarmed, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, as long as you are trying to draw your area, your marker falls into the death spiral, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross your own path or return. If you hesitate and don't complete your surface, a fuse will be infected and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. If the drawing speed is slow, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controllers work properly. For more information, see “Service Program.” The volume can be adjusted using the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
In general. The 4 switches - located in the device -, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used for programming and testing.
Programming display This display selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The languages can be set using the “sub-test” button. When the desired language appears - green - press the “Test” button to switch to the next program display. Deployment programming. With this display, the difficulty factor for the game can be determined. Furthermore, it can be used to set a “maximum number of credits” that may exist before the start of the game. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the “Sub-Test” button (appears green); the desired value for this line is programmed with the “Up” or “Down” button. By pressing the “Sub-Test” button several times, the factory or default setting can be achieved if the bottom line (RESET line) glows green, press the “Up” button. The values are reset, the pointer (called the lines that appear green) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. “Test” always triggers the next program display. “Back” [Reserve high score value x 10,000) is used to transfer the high score points to the next program display until “High hit rate so far.” This value determines the required points/hit number that a player needs so that their own initials (names) and hit points can be entered on the screen. The “maximum number of credits” determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptance is blocked if there is a coin lock. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 to 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin, the loans cannot become zero if over 99 is added up. A free spins mode can be selected by setting “Maximum number of credits” to O. Further programming: “Number of games”: number of markers per credit
“Threshold”: Amount of the% number that must be reached in order to switch to the next round
“Time Limit”: Approval for additional Sparx
“Difficulty”: The difficulty level of the game process
“Tightening tone”: with “0" no sound when stationary
With “1" sound even when standing (animated sound) “table model”: with “0" standing device
with “1" table-top device
The loans per coin are set on the “slot programming” screen. High score program display (highest hit rate so far”). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set the high score selected on the previous screen (setting “back”). By pressing the “Up” button, the initials QIX Standard are set. When you press the “Test” button, the next program display appears. The “overall evaluation.” By pressing the “Up” button, you can set it to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts over. The total number can only appear to 0 if the battery or the W1 connector is removed, when the device is switched off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Medium coins: (not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Loans paid: Number of loans given for thrown in (converted coins). Loans granted: Number of loans given by the device.% Free spins: Loans granted (Loans paid + credits granted per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes played if the game is extended or won.% Free time: Minutes/minutes won per 100. Average playing time in seconds: Minutes played/Loans paid + credits granted
High score: Number at which a player had high enough hit rates to oust other players from the high score list. By pressing the “Up” button, the values are set to 0. Press the “Test” button to display the next program.
Throw slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the display can select a standard coin setting or program another setting
If a standard setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the “Up” and “Down” buttons, while the top digit glows green on the screen. The size values change as the number changes. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the “Test” button, the setting is accepted. If a setting is required that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by pressing the “Sub-Test” button. After pressing it once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own settings are possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changes the values that are not appropriate. As soon as the setting has been made, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the “Sub-Test” button. If pressed unintentionally, the default setting appears. The values can be increased or reduced with the “Up” and “Down” buttons. The process is completed by pressing the “Test” button. The coin multiplier (“coin unit”) says how many coin units are given for each coin thrown in through an associated slot. Coin units - “Credit” shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. “Bonus” coin units show the required units before a bonus credit is issued. “Min. coin” is a value that accumulates loans until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used as “0". CMOS MEMORY (memory) FAILURE
If “Memory Failure - Service Required” appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in RAM are reset to factory default settings. This condition is likely to indicate battery failure or failure.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the “Sub-Test” button or the “Self-Test” button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display; by pressing the “Test” button, the next program is displayed. If an endurance test of the video board is required, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test starts in auto test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is switched off. When the “Open Coin Door to Test” display appears, the J 19, 1 - 2 program plug must be plugged in. When the J 19 connector is disconnected, the memory (memory) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be carried out. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off/I = on/X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the ROM checksum is error-proof, U 10 is displayed first. If this test is not successful, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional safety of memory shared by two processors by storing predefined series of numbers in RAM and then verifying whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 When the device stops with the above display, an error has been discovered. If the communication RAMs fail during the video board test, the fault may have been caused by faulty wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To localize the fault, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: Failure in the U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all storage locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predefined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are checked for accuracy when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Test U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by inscribing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared with the original sample. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnosis does not show a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is displayed that the next check is being started (Data Hardware). The connection to the data processor must be available and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That is also the reason for Star No. 1 the 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable stitching defects. BUT I was probably too excited about this jacket, because the disappointment was all the greater. I was guided by the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it's supposed to be so tight and I didn't want to fight my way into an S or M with my bust size... In the end, it would have fit the length and waist... I could swim the rest. In addition, the lining material arrived as soon as the package was opened and spread all over the place. Just a shame.. It will be returned:/
Fast delivery and fine workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it easily from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is absolutely delighted. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will certainly still be worn next year. We can recommend ordering.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not ideal. Unfortunately I've measured myself and the edition doesn't quite fit. But that is my mistake. I then slightly changed something so that it fits. The pad looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the entire surface. It worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is okay, but not under a year. Since the area to chew is much too big for the small mouth. We picked it up when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use it due to its size. Now that we are 12 months old, we have looked for him again and he can use it. He also hasn't been able to bite anything yet with his already few existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it really calmed him down.
Quality is not adequate/Unfortunately it is declining
I have probably been dazzled by the sometimes exuberant reviews here. First of all, I would like to say that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (to store the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you. As a result of the fact that I have just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read through many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that (as written in many reviews) it can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices... Guys, that's just not true! I was really hoping it would be so, but there really can't be any talk of it. The padded walls are much thinner and don't offer as much protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the divisions inside, are of a different caliber, much more drab. Overall, the feel of this backpack is not comparable to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small items are also not exactly of high quality. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to pay for a decent backpack. It seems that quality does come at a price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew it was going back after 2 minutes. What I really liked was the color on the inside. You'll certainly find your stuff much faster here than with a grey interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine is declining.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
So far, I had enjoyed the electrical series by E. L. Todd the most, but this book revised my opinion. I found the first two books very strong and also recommended and was really looking forward to the third part. This part is all about Volt and Taylor's feelings and I found it unnecessarily protracted. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself and then is like a small child at every fight and gets away?! At the same time, there were also disagreements, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part, Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor liked him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't without him and that he heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping that this was the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and also quite unnecessary at the same time. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more excitement to the story again.
Man destroys everything, doesn't appreciate anything and doesn't learn more! First of all: The movie isn't that bad now, as many write. Of course, the story is completely constructed, and designed over and over again according to the same scheme F. When you've seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: People destroy everything, they don't appreciate anything, and they don't learn more! And that is exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How many times have I just thought about the movie (even though I know that it's just a movie and the animals come from the computer): Oh my god, the poor animals, it often makes you cry. That's why Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is really well done. It's just a shame that people simply don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream movie. We are consistently destroying animals and the environment and, in the end, our planet and ourselves too. Out of belongings and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: Not true. 4 stars because the film is well done, but unfortunately always on the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Still a well-done popcorn movie.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a movie à la 8 mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and it doesn't even want to be. This film is above all “French” - it is also calm, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and makes you cry - when you get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that he doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90s, of course orange, but that doesn't matter. A package every morning for 5 days: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My waist has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has persisted for 1 week. It can be noticed that only 2 stars were given for the smaller package size (unfortunately seen too late), for the larger package size a full 5? That is very very strange!
Terrible smell and low results! I dyed my blonde hair a chocolate brown with an intensive tint in October, and in February/March I used this hair color remover. I've used the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, the result was not too bad, the result was about chestnut brown (a bit darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfied. This time it was just a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked the same as the first time I tried it. What was the worst of all, it still smelled weeks after use. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell simply did not disappear.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always take one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance had already been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and an even longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating healthily but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I'm sleeping better and I'm getting out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Highly recommended.
Function not entirely perfect!!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following major defects, which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems “connecting” to the cell phone over time. This means that charging is no longer carried out even though you have pressed the “Power On/Off” button for 3 seconds. If you remove the cell phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the cell phone in the case, the cover is now so worn out that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times already. These aren't many major flaws, but I think that a case with a battery should function perfectly and that's why I'm very disappointed with the product for the cost of €30, especially because I've only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all this good review came about. In the end, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you get from every optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I promised myself a lot more of these cloths, they are really very thin. Since I have used it, unfortunately I can no longer exchange it, I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side, the price for these towels is overstated more than 2 euros should not be available.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I received as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke down. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I really liked it in the shower), plays bass and bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come off.. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I am critical of is the frequency response of this small loudspeaker. As I said, bass is played back as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, that causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of singing almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible well enough. My old speaker didn't reproduce bass as bass well, but the frequencies were displayed fairly naturally in volume. Unfortunately, that's not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. So I have to subtract a star there. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
The paint had chipped off in a few places and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint also went off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up free of charge because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but as if both dresser were damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and sent us the money back. PRAISE to Amazon
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in quality. Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I didn't fault it because I needed this product urgently. The included adhesive barely holds, but it sticks neatly - like chewing gum which, however, does not harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. Some of the templates are not completely cut out. Ok for single use and as a gag for a party, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + magnetic clasps + nice look + sturdy when set up + shelf can be positioned as you want
- doors pop with magnets (you may be able to compensate with rubber nubs) - some unclean areas
- included dowels are much too small and wobble (I didn't have any others and I didn't have them because there wasn't a trophy in the house, stuck with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (I wrapped it with a little paper and balanced it out) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give it less stars because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. I also find it a bit too expensive for that.
I like the coffee... but
... there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that sense, I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't flow through evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packaged see photo) also means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full points soon.
Gets on my alarm
The alarm arrived quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound awful, and extremely loud too. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that's possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and also the color change, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also liked the fact that it has a battery so that the clock and alarm time do not have to be entered again in the event of a power failure. But declined for the reasons mentioned above.
Great light, workmanship inadequate
I've replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. “Pay 6 - get 4” is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have settled this fairly and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. So I see it as my mistake and live with it. However, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for a two-star deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated. The light color is more towards cold white. Perfect for hallways, workrooms, laundry rooms, etc. I would personally use warmer light for living spaces. Quite comparable with a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can do that too and I may also get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is of any help, I would be happy to receive a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Tolle
I've received gestures, and I'd love to share my first look. Yes positive. I've thought about ordering this set for a long time or not. ** The material is sturdy and feels good in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle so they can be hung up** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on coated pans. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **They also do not transmit the heat and can therefore be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swiping and they're gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-stock sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping is simply great. Delivery within 24 hours Then the shock, unpack the tap and check all parts. We found out that the part had already been installed. We have noticed considerable scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The screws/connections of the hoses were all damaged. However, we have installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that scratch marks/streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably already been delivered and returned. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; we will never order such goods via Amazon again, but rather spend a little more at the hardware store where we get decent goods. I just find it sad that customers are being fooled like this!!!
Product itself was great, unfortunately the outdoor sensor was broken after just 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy and the radio range is also very good, but there are no problems with transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still appears to be intact, and plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, as it always shows completely astronomical values of the outdoor humidity. This is a shame, as the device was attached to a protected area on the outside and that is also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak collection basket
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt today is still happily driving through the Republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with triggering a replacement delivery was excellent, as always. The mower arrived to me quickly and made a valuable impression. The motor is powerful and the result is a nice cut. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but okay. Unfortunately, the catch basket is a major drawback. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and made of fabric in between. If you put it down for just a short time, it will of course be compressed and parts of the content will fall out. What is worse, however, is that the actually practical fill level indicator shows red when the collection basket is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from there on. With a large lawn, always emptying the basket when it is only half full cannot be the solution. That's why I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the catch basket makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if required. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only shown once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to protect the battery. For the following reasons, I only give it 4 stars. - The soft back of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with very thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to remove the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be even louder.
Prusa i3 DIY 3D Printer
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to level up the hotbed properly yet. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, yet the hotbed is still too high there and at the front right the screw almost falls out because it is not tightened at all even though the hotbed is still too low. The bars that hold the cart are straight and so is the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do there, because it's impossible to print something out that way. About the construction: The construction was quite easy, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you would have to re-lay them several times, which is very difficult. I've already contacted support, but I still haven't received an answer after waiting a week. Unfortunately, sending them back is also no longer possible. I was expecting a bit more.
robust and precise I am pleasantly surprised
Unfortunately, my old caliper has given up after many years, so I needed a new one. This one looks very robust and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully serves its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods. I can only give it full marks and I think it will last at least as long as the old caliper. With, there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, long-lasting smell
I bought the bracelet and haven't worn it for the time being because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it has been “aired out” constantly. Since it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. Rate from purchase
Ok for the price
The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks quite massive. The larger spheres are free to move, which in turn I find very nice. However, the necklace is very easy to make overall, so I've already opened the clasp twice. So far, I've been able to repair it again and again, but I don't think it will go well/last long. But for the low price, you simply can't expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to say the end through your mouth, it can't open, amazing! I've rubbed it with a little leather care, which makes it even softer and cuddly. But if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately rubbish! I was disappointed even after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: It only connects after a few gimmicks... if you follow the instructions, it doesn't work at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station and re-installed it, the transmitters have finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, because the connection was gone again after just one hour, even though the stations were next to the base station. The display of the three stations was also very different! All in all, it's not that useful for me! The thing went back! In any case, I would advise against a purchase, it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I've had this garden pump before, unfortunately the thread of the internal shaft rusted off after 3.5 years. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently due to the current drought and I knew the connections to the suction line and outlet would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production fault and that the current pump will do its job a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump was damaged during transport, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slits were broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a bit better in the future than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance.
It could have been thought through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than walking around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. Everything went pretty well at first. However, the paint came off very quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this also works with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I didn't find a suitable slotted screwdriver that wouldn't have ruined the whole screw right away. Now to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths thanks to the various parts, but once you have screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to disassemble the whole thing again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw broke off in the thread the third time I installed it and the entire thing was therefore unusable. Conclusion: If at all, then all the keys you need for just once and then never again, but at that price, you can also buy yourself a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite match the specified dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material looks robust and all of this is featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually assess the goods after they have been used for the first time. First of all, I can say that the height is lower than stated. At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really large parts can be placed directly in the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8 but 10 pieces were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/sachets. Not of high quality workmanship, but I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of a different material than the other bags doesn't bother me personally. I see the price/performance ratio as a trial price and that's okay.
So-so
Well, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas. Now that I wanted to use it again, he didn't do it anymore. battery? Swapped. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money straight into the garbage can.
Care is always good! It is easy to use, but you should use the brush very carefully so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear any improvement in the sound of my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life is very long. Definitely a completely adequate sound. I liked the fact that the headphones do not hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The earpieces are super soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions. Price-performance ratio is in full agreement here, especially since I also bought it in the flash deal. It fits my size perfectly, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I would only have liked the neckline not to be as deep and the sleeves could also use a little more fabric (if you don't have very thin upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously did not expect that such scrap would be sold these days. The drive is operated on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. However, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD works normally, Blu-rays are only detected unreliably. The discs must be inserted several times, then Rödel makes noises that have not been heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes, you can either restart the computer because it doesn't work anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But then you should never press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language or anything during the movie. This immediately results in an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for an additional fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually eyewash, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there to charge some devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a bit disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a stupid extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But apart from the look and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the plugged in USB stick doesn't simply dangle around like a normal extension cord. So not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is kept within tight limits :-).
Small but powerful! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With iOS 12, you can now also move data back and forth. This works really well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I already had to send back were unable to do so. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Charging at the same time is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for: P There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This should provide stability and also has a magnetic mount. With my case, it doesn't fit with the adapter. Well, it's safe and secure and therefore has contact... All in all, a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and sturdy in one piece of aluminum. Price performance fits.
Plenty of performance
Top device. It's been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet but performs well. I find the average temperature setting (TP setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2. Has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and has survived it well. And I like the simple design too. Competitive products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The workmanship of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but it does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We've had the tracker for about 6 months and are pleasantly surprised in live mode, the location feels accurate to 0.5m. In offline mode, however, when the dog is in the house, it likes to jump by a few meters, but this is not annoying. I would buy it again anytime. But what would be great would be a battery that lasts longer. It currently lasts about 1.5 hours. A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great here. There is an XL version, but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, so our battery wouldn't have to last that long and we also find changing it every day impractical. You should deal with the dog, not with its collar :-). The app also worked perfectly.
Rubbish after a few weeks
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and appear to be comfortable too. However, the lifespan is declining more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in gym class, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. The last pair also didn't last very long in normal use, but I thought it would be enough for the lesson. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive trash and absolutely not recommended.
Perfect fit - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke down after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there doesn't seem to be any difference, but at second glance, you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the strap on the heel is quite loose and will most likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm excited!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews here yet, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would love to sleep in the car, I ordered them with good luck. The package included the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is a bit of mold on one side. I've wiped it away and hope it doesn't show up again. When inflated, a lying test was carried out directly. It is easy to lie on and is great for the festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but for days at the event, it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully in my car. Before that, we removed the seats at the back. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car cigarette lighter. However, the plug was faulty (something at the solder joint). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and when reassembled, the good part worked perfectly and inflated the mattress in no point. Overall, I'm very impressed with the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope that it doesn't lose air and that it lasts a long time. It also ensures that mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend them. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than €10... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For the quick delivery. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, due to the lax processing, the calendar opened several doors directly on day 1. On the 21st door, there were no more doors at all and I had to more or less allow my son to remove the remaining parts accordingly, as they almost met him. The parts often come out mixed up, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to put the parts on. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off when playing. (Mostly the windscreen. It is also very difficult to reinstall it.) As such, I would no longer buy this calendar and would not recommend it to anyone else. Manufacturers may rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and do it better. :\
a real drone
I'm impressed by the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. It flies very well inside and the 5 minute flight time is usually enough. I didn't expect hair to get stuck in it and the drone would break down very quickly at the price, but falls from the ceiling onto the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, nice contact.
Game ok but can only be played by force on Steam. When I bought it, I didn't see that it wasn't a game CD but just a code with which you can download the game. That would still be okay so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is an impudence. Since then, the computer has been constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery life
I was really looking forward to the watch. Great design and look, messages etc. were displayed without any problems. Service worked well... and yet I'm sending it back. Big snags: the battery and its running time. Charged in the evening, just in the closet overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery ran out by midday/early afternoon and then you can't even tell the time anymore. Therefore not useful for me. It's a shame.
Elegant case with limitations
You should definitely buy a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+. Recently, I liked cases in which you can also insert your credit card. This is what the case here offers. If you put cards in all 3 pockets, it gets too many, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case looks robust and seems to be well made. She looks classy. Unlike many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only the ports have openings. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on/off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even the QI leather charging station from TORRO doesn't work. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
High-quality case with tempered glass film
Robust case with real tempered glass to protect the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily pulled up. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It is not too bulky and fits snugly to the phone. Overall a good buy.
