Rabies cases are on the rise in northeastern Thailand
Dr. Tawichai of the 9th Office of Disease Control and Prevention said on February 9 that rabies infections have increased in northeastern Thailand over the past few months, bringing the total number of infected people to 74.
Since the beginning of this fiscal year (October last year to September this year), a total of 74 people have tested positive for rabies in Surin and Buriram provinces in the northeast, 67 and 7, respectively.
All have been vaccinated against rabies in the past.
He urged people to get vaccinated against rabies with their pets and not to touch the saliva of suspected infected animals.
Rabies infects humans not only from dogs, but also from cats and bats.
If a person is infected and develops symptoms, almost 100% of them die, but vaccination before the onset of symptoms can prevent death.

Park Chung Farm in Kyongseong-gun, North Hamgyong Province is located in a mountainous area, and most of the fields are steep and the soil is not good.
Farms like this had an unusually high yield last year.
The achievements of the Chongjin Central Zoo Feed Guarantee Fisheries Office are significant.
The office was established in 2011 with the mission of sending marine products for feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
While exceeding the fishing plan, they have been supporting farms in Chongjin City in recent years, such as procuring agricultural supplies.
However, this time, the company supported a farm in Gyeongseong County, which is adjacent to the city, not in Chongjin City.
Moreover, I decided to help the branch of Park Chung farm, which is said to be the most demanding in the county.

Chubu Keizai Shimbun | Economic Information for Aichi, Gifu, Mie, and Shizuoka
FUJI, a company based in Chiryu City that manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system that prevents children from being left behind in vehicles.
A motion sensor is installed in the car, and when it detects the movement of a person, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
We are currently conducting a demonstration experiment with a pick-up vehicle at our own facility.
We protect the safety of children in the midst of tragic accidents caused by leaving them behind.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with two pick-up vehicles at "teracoya THANK", an English conversation after school for children operated by our company in Chiryu City.
Motion sensors that detect the movement of people based on the temperature difference between people and their surroundings are installed in three places on the ceiling of the car.
It automatically sends a warning notification when it detects the movement of a person after a certain period of time has elapsed while the vehicle's engine is turned off and the door is closed.
By linking information with the state of the engine and doors, false positives can be prevented as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling a pre-registered number, it will be displayed in a chat on a computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and care is taken to prevent mistakes such as missing out.
The demonstration experiment is expected to continue until the end of February.
“During the experiment, we were able to see peripheral issues other than the system,” said Ikko Kamiya, manager of the second section of the Innovation Promotion Department.
For example, they were able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"We want to expand our solutions," he says.
The development of a system to prevent people from being left behind was triggered by a series of accidents involving shuttle buses across the country.
Employees with young children suggested what they could do to protect the safety of their children.
We decided to develop it in order to make use of the know-how we have cultivated through FA (factory automation) related businesses, such as information management using IoT (Internet of Things) and sensors.
FUJI's anti-leaving system is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since the system can be easily retrofitted to pick-up and drop-off vehicles, the company aims to lower the barriers to adoption and promote its widespread use.
In the future, we will consider commercialization with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens.
[Editorial] Construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen between Tsuruga and Shin-Osaka, which was scheduled to begin in fiscal 2023, has been postponed, and the development of the areas west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture is beginning to be affected.
In Obama City, where the new station will be built, the detailed location of the station is not indicated even now, and urban planning including the development of the surrounding area is at a standstill.
The plan is expected to take a long time to formulate, and needs to be announced as soon as possible.
The planned Hokuriku Shinkansen station in Obama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga Station.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency announced that the approximate location of the station would be within a 2.5-kilometer radius of JR Higashi-Obama Station.
The detailed location of the station and the route were expected to be determined in the winter of 2022.
In fiscal 2021, Obama City will launch a full-scale project related to the Shinkansen in anticipation of the opening of Tsuruga Station and the subsequent opening of Obama Station.
In the initial budget for fiscal 2022, the city plans to further increase the number of projects and promote urban development in anticipation of announcing the location of the new station.
However, the exact location of the new station is not known.
The city is considering land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station, and has provided a budget of 3 million yen for this fiscal year as a project to formulate a basic plan, but it is expected that it will not be implemented.
According to a city official, "it takes time for citizens to build consensus on urban planning centered on the new station."
There is an example of Echizen City at a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to compile the overall concept.
The later the announcement is made, the shorter the preparation period until the opening, and there is concern that this will affect the development of the surrounding area.
Before the location of the new station, there was a sense of uncertainty about the extension of the line west of Tsuruga Station.
In October last year, citizens' groups in Kyoto City along the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calling for the cancellation of the extension plan.
In response to the postponement of the start of construction in Ishikawa Prefecture, voices have been raised calling for a reconsideration of the Yonehara route, and there have been a series of moves to restore the routes that have already been settled to their original state, making it difficult to say that neighboring prefectures are monolithic.
Obama citizens' reaction to the postponement of construction is relatively calm, but the location of the new station is unknown, and there are concerns that future momentum will be affected if the opening date remains unclear.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue appealing to the national government to open the entire line as soon as possible, but the voices of the areas along the line calling for construction to begin as soon as possible are essential.
The indifference that "the Shinkansen (bullet train) will pass (to the west of Tsuruga) someday" cannot move the national government or neighboring prefectures and municipalities.
I want you to have the enthusiasm to keep raising your voice.
The chocolate section for Valentine's Day returns for the first time in three years. (© Seibu Fukui Store, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture)
Ahead of Valentine's Day on February 14, the price of chocolate in stores has risen due to soaring raw materials and packaging materials, but the high price range is selling well for personal "reward chocolates" and for family and friends.
Retail stores and confectionery shops in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that emphasize local colors, luxury, and commitment to ingredients.
The Seibu Fukui store (Fukui City) opened a special sales floor on the sixth floor of the event hall on January 25.
Until the 14th, about 40 brands and 450 kinds of sweets will be sold, including 10 confectionery stores in Okinawa.
Chocolate made with local sake from Fukui and sandwiches made with raw chocolate sandwiched between cookies are said to be popular.
According to the store manager, the retail price of most of the products has increased by about 10 percent compared to the previous year.
As for this year's trend, "There are many products with distinctive features, such as sticking to the ingredients and adding a sense of luxury to the packaging, and consumers tend to purchase products for themselves and their families and enjoy eating and comparing them."
Despite the headwinds of price hikes, sales in the high price range are said to be strong.
Average increase of 25 yen per grain due to the influence of high prices
The person in charge says, "I try to create a sales floor where people can enjoy the Valentine's Day event itself."
The shop has been selling daily recommended sweets since January 26, and has resumed tasting for the first time in three years.
The Western Confectionery Club (headquartered in Ippon-Tanaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai City), which manufactures and sells Western confectionery, launched the KISEKI series of original chocolates jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate manufacturer at the end of last year for the first time during the Valentine's Day shopping season.
It is characterized by a fruity taste that is particular about cacao beans and suppresses bitterness, and is sold at 1,000 yen for 3 pieces and 3,000 yen for 9 pieces.
"While the culture of giri-chocolate is gradually fading, there is a demand to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine's Day, and we will differentiate ourselves by increasing the added value of our products," said Ryoma Takakura, director and general manager of the company's purchasing department.
How to get chocolate from a woman...Question to a popular AI chatbot
A female office worker in her 20s (Fukui City) who visited the Seibu Fukui store on the 9th said, “I’ve always loved chocolate, so I’ve been able to get a job and get paid, so I want to buy it as a reward for myself.”
A female office worker in her 30s who bought the chocolate said, "It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolate, but since it is once a year, I want to give it to my family and people who are usually indebted to me, but the number of people who give it may decrease."

Seven-Eleven Japan Co., a major Japanese convenience store chain, announced on February 9 that it will begin selling six new products made from ingredients grown in Fukui Prefecture, including sweet shrimp, at 339 stores in the three prefectures of Hokuriku.
As a project to commemorate the first anniversary of the conclusion of a comprehensive partnership agreement related to all aspects of prefectural administration, we will promote the appeal of prefectural products.
In addition to the four new products of shrimp miso ramen and soup made with sweet shrimp caught in the prefecture, salad made with Okinawan midi tomatoes, and cream puffs with habutae mochi and red bean paste, the shop also sells Fukui plum rice balls and sauce cutlet rice bowls.
It is scheduled to be sold until the 20th.

On September 9, Tomohiro Akutsu, deputy general manager of the company's operations division, paid a courtesy visit to Governor Tatsuharu Sugimoto.
Governor Sugimoto, who tasted the soup, said, "The sweet shrimp soup stock is delicious."
A representative of the company said, "We would like to continue to develop products made in Fukui Prefecture."
Ruins of Ushigahara-jo Castle, which is said to have been built in preparation for the battle against Heisen-ji Temple: Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
The Inuikawa area in Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, was once the location of a large-scale Ushigahara manor.
Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built on the hillside of Mt. Nabetoko in the area in preparation for the battle against Heisenji Temple, which was in conflict with the manor during the Kamakura period.
He appeared in the war chronicle 'Taiheiki' (The Record of the Great Peace).
Although no materials about Ushigahara-jo Castle remain, 'Echizen Ushigahara Jito Suicide' in Volume 11 of the Taiheiki (The Record of the Great Peace) describes the following:
Ukyo no suke Tokiharu AWAKAWA, who was an official of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), was dispatched to Ono as jito (manager and lord of manor).
In 1333, Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto), which was established to monitor the Imperial Court and rule the western part of Japan, was overthrown by Takauji ASHIKAGA, and the Kamakura bakufu was overthrown by Yoshisada NITTA.
When Tokiharu's retainers heard the news that Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto) was destroyed, they immediately ran away, and only about 20 people remained.
Taking advantage of this, armed priests of Heisen-ji Temple invaded the temple.
When Tokiharu let his wife and two children drown in the river, he followed them and committed suicide.
The impregnable castle where Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu stood together
The Inui Side Improvement Association, which is made up of local residents, published the Inui Side History Story in 2014.
Tokiharu's tragic story is introduced in a comic book so that even elementary school students can easily understand it.
Masao Kitagawa, 75, who was involved in the publication, said, “I want the local people to know about the history around them and pass it on to future generations.”

The castle ruins can be reached by a mountain trail maintained by the Inuikai.
It is about 200 meters from the trailhead.
The road leading to the trailhead is sometimes inaccessible due to snow in the winter.
Association for Bettering the Inui Side
There are about 220 households in the Inui area of Ono City.
In the past, Torisetsu on the Inui side was published to introduce burial mounds, historical sites, and highlights in the area.
Rennyo no Sato Awara, a roadside station under construction in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture, will open on April 22.
In anticipation of the opening of Awara Onsen Station on the Hokuriku Shinkansen line in the spring of 2024, the station is expected to be used by approximately 360,000 people annually as a new regional development and tourist base in the northern part of the city.
The main restaurant and retail facility at the station is a steel-framed one-story building with a total floor area of 975 square meters.
The total area of the roadside station, including the parking lot and Nagisa Children's Park, is 8137 square meters.
The facility will also have a rest area and a tourist information center.
Electric bicycles can be rented, and there is also a shower room.
The two parking lots will accommodate a total of 66 small and large vehicles (including three for the disabled).
Mayor Morinotsugu of the city announced it at a regular press conference held on February 8.
At the eating and drinking corner, parfaits using fruits from the northern hills of Sakai and Tomitsu Kintoki pies are sold.
He is working on developing a menu that uses plenty of local ingredients, such as tamago kake gohan (rice topped with eggs) using Fukujidori chicken, and autumn and winter dishes using eel from Kitagata.
Currently, about 60 businesses are members of the "Shippers' Council" of direct sales shops.
There is also an extensive selection of processed foods such as boxed lunches and side dishes, and agricultural and horticultural products such as seedlings and plants.
The souvenir corner displays and sells works by artists residing in the Kanatsu Museum of Art, as well as sweets, sake, and traditional crafts.
=> Roadside Station Ranking, 'Minami Echizen Sankairi' ranked first in the Kinki region.
The designated manager of the station is Awara Running LLC (2-chome, Yoshizaki, Awara City), which was established by Masashi Miyatani, president of Tsuki Usagi no Sato, a theme park where you can interact with rabbits in Kaga City, Ishikawa Prefecture.
At the press conference, Mayor Mori said, “We will restore and promote energy and vitality throughout Awara City, which will lead to the improvement of the lives of local residents and the revitalization of the region.”

His adorable facial expression is said to be popular with family customers. (Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture)
In the restaurant industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, there is a growing movement to introduce robots that deliver food to customers.
It is useful for labor-saving store management and "contactless" customer service to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, and the adorable expression of the robot is popular with family customers.
Restaurant owners and related parties say, “It is difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, and catering robots will become even more popular.”
"Jin, Jin, Genghis Khan".
While playing light music, a robot with a cat's face displayed on the screen puts food on it and runs smoothly through the store.
When I arrived at the table, I said to the customer, "I brought you the food you ordered."
At the Iwashio Aged Genghis Khan Bonta branch in Fukui City’s Ote 2-chome district, a cat-shaped robot for serving meals was introduced in August 2022.
By placing the food ordered by the customer on a robot waiting near the kitchen and pressing the table number on the screen, the robot autonomously moves to the table and delivers it.
It has a built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice function, which reacts when the customer touches it, and the expression of the cat's face on the screen is rich.
The Bonta Group, which runs the restaurant, has introduced food-serving robots at two of its stores, including this one.
President Toshiyuki Saito states that the reason for introducing the system is “the biggest labor shortage,” and emphasizes that it is part of efforts to improve productivity through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to sales in stores is usually about 30%, but it is said that the introduction has reduced it to 21-22%.
The robot also plays the role of collecting plates that customers have finished eating, improving the efficiency of cleanup, and adding that "families and children are happy and it also has advertising effects."
Rokken Hoshiyama Fukui, a yakiniku and offal hot pot restaurant in Araki-Shimpo-cho, Fukui City, also introduced a catering robot in August 2022.
Mr. Eifuku Hoshiyama, the president of Sonsan Shoten Co., Ltd., said, "Even if we recruit employees and part-time workers, it is difficult for them to come, so I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
The Fukui store operates by separating the zone where employees serve food and the robot delivery range.
The lease fee for the robot is said to be about the same as the wage for one part-time job.
In order to save labor, the store has introduced an ordering system using tablet terminals in addition to robots, and is considering self-checkout.
According to the Fukui Labour Bureau, the effective job openings-to-applicants ratio by job category for customer service such as restaurants is 6.94 times as of December 2022, which indicates that there is a high labor shortage.
A person in charge of the Internet system (Takagi Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which serves as a sales agent for catering robots, said, “The shortage of workers at restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious, partly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have received many inquiries about introducing robots.”
President Hoshiyama said, “It will be even more difficult for rural suburban stores to secure employees in the future, and I think catering robots will become more popular.”
[Editorial] Echizen Town makes an ending note and distributes it to the townspeople who want it.
Two years ago, he published the Okuyami Handbook, which contains the procedures necessary when a relative dies, a written inheritance list, and a family tree, and many people came to pick it up for themselves.
Lectures on how to write ending notes and organize your life are often held in various parts of the prefecture, and the term "shukatsu" seems to have become firmly established among the citizens of the prefecture.
Echizen Town's ending note is 35 pages.
Starting with a review of his personal history in five chapters, he writes about his current health and financial situation, future nursing care, hopes for end-of-life care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section where you can write what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message to your loved ones.
It's hard to write 35 pages, but you don't have to fill all the pages.
What do you most want to write about to your family and the people around you?
The important thing is to clarify the purpose.
Bookstores sell a variety of notebooks according to the purpose, and it is said that it is easy to start writing where you can write.
Likened to job hunting, the term "shukatsu" was born in 2009.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake struck.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly", and more and more people are preparing for their own death and the end of life.
More than 10 years have passed since then.
The COVID-19 pandemic that hit the world has not yet subsided.
Prices rose as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other factors, and electricity prices jumped to unexpected levels this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current rise in prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, siblings and relatives shared funeral expenses, nursing care fees, grave management, etc., but nowadays it is not uncommon to have an only child.
In addition, life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a decade ago, but the dilemma is that the risk of dementia and the need for long-term care increases as people get older.
It is important to keep in mind that this increased social unrest is also behind the fact that chukatsu did not end as a temporary event but became established.
In any case, everyone wants to avoid overburdening their partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword in the ending notes, but don't be too self-righteous.
I don't want to write my wishes and requests secretly, but I want to consult with my family at least once and prepare calmly for that time.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (second from the right) and Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Keiko Nagaoka (third from the right) take a commemorative photo with officials at the elementary school they visited.
Tokyo, Feb. 10 (Jiji Press)—Students and teachers in Toda City, Saitama Prefecture, on February 10, 2017, have announced they do not, in principle, need to wear masks during their graduation ceremony.
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided on February 10 at the graduation ceremony that students should not wear masks.
A junior high school principal at a large school said, "It is actually difficult to keep a wide distance between students, and I am worried about how to deal with it, and some students are worried about taking off their masks."
It is said that this topic has been raised among teachers in response to media reports about wearing masks at graduation ceremonies.
On the other hand, one elementary school principal said, "If the government decides, we will not wear it.
At this graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to relax the measures, such as allowing current students who had refrained from participating and resuming the chorus of graduates.
In Okinawa, the prefectural high school will hold a ceremony in early March, and public elementary and junior high schools will hold a ceremony in the middle of the same month.
The prefectural and municipal boards of education will wait for an official notification from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology before making a decision on how to respond.
In addition, some were cautious about the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology’s decision not to require the wearing of masks in all school activities from the new semester this spring.
The principal of the elementary school said, "Children will be confused if they suddenly do not wear a mask one day, so it is natural that the number of children who decide to wear it freely first and then gradually remove it will increase."
× × × ×
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided not to require the wearing of masks in school education activities from April in accordance with the new government guidelines for wearing masks.
In principle, students will not wear masks in choirs, physical education classes, and club activities.
During the 2022 academic year, we will request infection control measures in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and will inform the Board of Education and school sites of precautions after April.
Even during the 2022 academic year, graduates, faculty and staff members, and current students participating in graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high and high schools and universities will be required to take ventilation and other measures and not wear masks.

At the hair salon Hair Atelier Rim Rim in Tsuka-cho, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, every year during the entrance exam season, students are cut using scissors and other tools to pray for success.
Students responded positively, saying, "I feel more confident now," and "I was able to take the exam calmly."
Yasushi Nagata, the president of the beauty salon, has seen and heard students open their textbooks while waiting for their haircuts and express their anxiety about taking exams during their haircuts.
Therefore, in 2014, we started to cut the prayer for passing the exam, hoping that it would be useful even a little.
Compilation of the last day of national and public university applications
Every year, on the first day of work, the beauty salon asks scissors and combs to pray for success at Kazusa Shrine in Wakatake-cho, Wakatake City.
About 80 people are cut every year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are various employment exams and driver's license exams.
She presents him with a pencil to pray for his success.
Mama Ogi "To you who are challenging the high school entrance exams"
In 2021, a 19-year-old man who successfully passed the entrance exam to the University of Tokyo said, "I was happy to be able to convey my support, and I was inspired when I used the golden pencil I received for the exam."
A self-published book 'Dear Prime Minister, "The Breakwater of Life" from Tojinbo' published by NPO 'Collection and Editorial Bureau that resonates with the heart'
"Dear Prime Minister, The Breakwater of Life from Tojinbo" I self-published my tenth book under this title.
It has been picked up by newspapers all over the country, and we have received many comments from readers.
The purpose of this book is to share with you what we have heard directly from suicide attempters about "social and structural" environmental problems regarding the causes of suicide in Japan, and to create a "comfortable society to live in".
For 18 years and 10 months, we patrol the rocky shores of Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a famous suicide spot, to prevent suicide. We continue our support activities until we find, protect, and restart suicide attempters.
This book summarizes the problems heard from 784 people (as of February 6) who have been protected so far, and appeals to the Prime Minister on the following seven items regarding the national measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "lifesaving" activities.
(2) There is a mountain of "human rights violations" behind suicide.
(3) Suicide victims are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens living outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) Even if a person with a mental illness such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, it is treated as an "accident".
(6) The "duty to consider safety" in high-risk areas of suicide has been forgotten and is being driven to commercialism.
(7) The part of the doctrine of new religious groups that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of threatening the other party to provide money or goods by announcing the future curse is blackmail.
Religious groups that commit criminal acts of "fraud and extortion" should be publicly announced and excluded.
Therefore, in the impressions received from those who have subscribed to this book, "I was moved by the strong mentality of those who are working on this activity", "This former police officer is a model among police officers", "It is a living Bodhisattva who supports like his own family even though he is a stranger".
When I saw the photo of the newspaper article, I cried, "What are you thinking ...?"
I have heard that the number of suicides of people who have been cornered by the corona disaster is increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone is like that person.
I want it to be a society where people can live happily with their lives.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude for the staff who gave their all to those who suffered so much that they wanted to die.
I think that this activity is an activity that overworks both mind and body, but I would like to ask you to continue to talk to me in the future.
Thank you very much.

Shimada Kenji takes pictures of capybaras almost every week and posts them on social media at Hapijan, an indoor facility at Asuwayama Park Amusement Park in Fukui Prefecture, on February 1.
There is a man in Fukui Prefecture who takes photos of capybaras every week at Hapijan, an indoor facility at Asuwayama Park Amusement Park in Fukui City, and posts them on Instagram.
The posts are lined with a variety of thumbnail images, such as the moment you yawn with your teeth peeking out of your big mouth, or the moment you lie down and bask in the sun.
He has more than 10,000 followers in Japan and abroad, and helps many people to know the charm of Hapijan and Capybara.

The man is Kenji Shimada (38), an office worker living in the city.
In March 2021, we started posting on exchange sites (SNS).
The capybara is one of the largest rats in the world, and it is good at swimming with a paddle between its fingers.
Since its opening in 2018, Hapijan has raised a total of three animals, one male and two female, and visitors can observe and feed them up close.
Mr. Shimada first learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
When he saw the video of him relaxing in the hot springs, he was shocked and asked, “What is this animal?”
I was drawn to the charming expressions and gestures like a human being.
I heard that they will be raised in Hapijan after that, and I was looking forward to seeing them up close.
I started taking photographs in earnest about three years ago when I bought a single-lens reflex camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of the capybara, and you can't miss the chance to take a picture of it shaking its body and cutting the water like a drill.
The number of Instagram posts has reached about 830, and I look back on it and say, "How dare you take so many photos."
Perhaps because he remembered Shimada-san, the male Yamato-kun came up to him and cried out, "Kyurukyuru."
"It's cute and I'm happy," says Shimada, and his love for capybaras continues to deepen.
He also enjoys interacting with capybara lovers all over the country through SNS, such as showing them the best shots every month.
Mr. Shimada, who visits zoos in neighboring prefectures to see capybaras, said with a smile, “I would like to continue shooting and transmitting information, mainly on the home ground of Mt. Asuwa.”

Toba City calls for double payment of child-rearing household benefits - Ise Shimbun
(Toba City) -- Toba City announced on Monday that a total of 600,000 yen ($54,000) was mispaid to 12 people in 11 households for the fiscal 2021 special subsidy for households raising children (other households).
The city will apologize to the beneficiaries, explain the circumstances, and request procedures for their return.
According to the city, it was discovered on January 27, 2022, after being pointed out by the guardian of the target child who confirmed the past payment.
After checking all 182 people from 79 households who were eligible for payment in the same fiscal year, it was found that the benefit paid on July 20, 2021 was doubled for 12 people from 11 households.
The city will provide a subsidy of 50,000 yen (about U.S.$470) per person for high school students and younger who live in tax-exempt households.
He said that he received data extracted from the target children from the outsourced computer company, but the staff in charge misunderstood that the data did not include high school students and added it to the data.
A person in charge of the city’s child-rearing support office said, “We take this matter very seriously and will take all possible measures to prevent recurrence, such as rechecking the data, and strive to restore trust.”

It is snowing again.
It seems that it is not a cold wave from the north, but the influence of a low pressure system on the south coast that moves east through the Japanese archipelago.
It has only been a short time since I experienced the abnormal cold on the 24th and 26th of last month, and I can't let my guard down. ▼ Even with the same cold, it will be even more bearable for the people of the Republic of Turkey, which was hit by a major earthquake.
The building collapsed in an instant.
So far, more than 20,000 people have lost their lives, including those in neighboring Syria, and many people are still left behind in the rubble. ▼This country is known as a pro-Japanese country.
It all began with the shipwreck of the battleship Ertuğrul, which was dispatched to Japan by the Ottoman Empire in 1890.
The fact that residents of Kushimoto Town in Wakayama Prefecture helped and cared for the crew is introduced in movies and novels. ▼ About 100 years after the accident, a Turkish aircraft was dispatched to the rescue of Japanese hostages by Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War to repay their gratitude.
Those who have experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.
When the situation settles down, we want to pay attention to the reconstruction and restoration.

Bellino Hotel Receipt of Subsidy|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Newspaper
On April 10, the prefectural government and the city of Ichinoseki announced that the Bellino Hotel Ichinoseki (in Yamame, Ichinoseki) has been using various subsidies to discount travelers' accommodation fees inappropriately for about a year since October 2021.
When people who were not eligible for discounts stayed at the hotel, they applied for a discount such as a name loan by an employee.
Many employees were found to use accommodations that were not in line with the business objective of stimulating tourism demand.
By the 6th of this month, the total amount of 7,231,000 yen received due to improper use, including voluntary investigations by the prefecture, the city and the hotel, has been returned.
The fraudulent receipt of subsidies was due to the prefectural accommodation discount "Iwate Travel Support Project" implemented in response to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, and the city's tourist accommodation emergency measure project "Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount".
The period is from October 18, 2021 to October 10, 2022 (Ichinoseki accommodation support discount is from September 30, 2022). According to the survey, there were 95 cases of inappropriate use that were not eligible for the discount, such as outside the target area or unvaccinated, at 587,000 yen, and 1,239 cases of use that was not in line with the purpose of the project at 6,644,000 yen.
When the prefectural business contractor was proceeding with the settlement procedure, it was confirmed that the user of the accommodation discount and the receptionist on the hotel side were the same person.
A detailed investigation by the prefectural government revealed inappropriate use, and the city that obtained this information also confirmed the facts.
The city's project has already been completed, and the registration for the prefectural project was also deleted on December 2 last year.
In response to the interview, Michiaki Dobashi, president of Bellino, which operates the hotel, said, "I apologize for the inconvenience caused to the local people, the prefecture, the city, and many people, and I am very sorry.It is a hotel with the local people, and I would like to restart from scratch again and work to restore trust."
Takahito Chiba, director of the promotion section of the prefectural tourism and promotion office, said, "It is truly regrettable.We would like to once again encourage compliance with the rules and the establishment of compliance, and call for appropriate use in accordance with the purpose of the project."
Mayor Yoshihito Sato said, “It is truly regrettable that there was inappropriate use of the project at accommodation facilities in the city.”
Shinto ritual at Morioka Racecourse in Mizusawa|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Newspapers
The training ceremony of the prefectural horse racing union was held on the 10th at the Mizusawa and Morioka racecourses, where officials prayed for the safety of people and horses and purified the riding grounds.
Among them, a Shinto ritual was held in front of Barekijin at Mizusawa Racecourse in Mizusawa Anetai-cho, Oshu City, attended by about 50 people including officials of the racecourse, horse owners, jockeys, and stable staff, and Kenichi ODAJIMA, the chief of the racecourse, offered tamagushi.
At Honbaba, Shinto priests and representatives went around the corners and sprinkled kirinusa to purify themselves.
During training, a number of horses went out to the riding ground and made minor adjustments.
White breathing horses were also seen in the cold.
The racecourse will be equipped with new track lighting for the 2023 season.
The twilight event can be held, and full-scale operation will be carried out after test lighting.
In the 22nd season of Iwate Keiba, 'Spring Horse Racing' was held at the same racecourse from March 11 to 14, 19 to 21, and 26 to 28.
Odajima said, “We want to train thoroughly for about a month and prepare for the special event.”
Roadside Station Kinshuko [Nishiwaga]|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
Michi-no-Eki Kinshuko in Suginahata, Nishiwaga-cho (manager: Yuki Masuoka) will open 'Menya Nishiki' specializing in ramen only on Thursdays, when the restaurant used to be closed.
They have developed new tantanmen noodles (850 yen including tax) using local ingredients so that more people can enjoy the taste of the local area.
Restaurant Kinshuko, which serves dishes such as "Yuda Dam Curry" (1,200 yen) and "Nishiwaga Marugoto Ramen" (900 yen), was closed on Thursdays to secure holidays for its staff, but customers said they were disappointed.
In response to this, we started ramen-only business on the 9th, which can be handled by a small number of people.
The restaurant decided to focus on four items on the menu: soy sauce ramen, soy sauce chashumen, miso ramen, and miso chashumen, as well as tantanmen noodles.
Along with the opening of Menya Nishiki, a new product, Tantanmen, is based on Yukikko Miso, which is made from soybeans and sun salt from Nishiwaga, and uses spring onions, Nishiwarabi, ground meat, chili peppers, and other ingredients from the town.
We have received many orders from the first day, and we will consider offering it other than Thursday in the future.
The roadside station will be closed from May 2021 to November 2022 due to the closure of National Route 107.
During this time, he opened an alternative restaurant "Ramen and Donburi no Mise Nishiki" in Kotsunagizawa in the same town, and made use of the accumulated know-how.
Manager Masuoka says, "The tantanmen noodles that warm the body are perfect for this time of year, and although it is a small menu, I want you to feel happy eating delicious food."
In winter, the restaurant is open from 11:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. (last order at 2:00 p.m.).

Special exhibition at the City Cultural Property Center [Hanamaki]|Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
A special exhibition titled "People Introducing Hayachine Flowers: A Brief History of Hayachine Botanical Research," featuring the pioneers who laid the foundations for botanical research on Mt.Hayachimine, which is known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, is being held at the City Cultural Property Center in Osako-cho, Hanamaki City until July 12.
It collects 124 materials, including valuable specimens collected by predecessors, and introduces the footprints of predecessors who were involved in the botanical research of Mt. Hayachine.
Hayachinezan's botanical research started with Karl Johann Maximovich (1827 - 1891), a Russian botanist who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Chonosuke SUGAWA (1842 - 1925), a native of Shiwa-cho, who collected plants under Maximovich's guidance.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to walk freely in the country because he was a foreigner, asked Sugawa to collect them and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa continued to support Maximovich's research after his return to Japan, which led to the publication of 'Himekozakura,' 'Nambutouchiso,' and 'Miyamabukishoma,' which are unique to Mt. Hayachine.
After that, Tomitaro MAKINO (1862-1957), a modern botanical taxonomist, published 'Nambutorano,' 'Kobanotsumekusa,' and 'Nambuinunazuna' based on the materials collected by local researchers in 1903, and 'Katohakobe,' which he himself discovered and named by climbing Mt. Hayachine in 1905.
From the exhibition materials, we can see that valuable alpine plants have been revealed by many researchers.
It also introduces Matsunosuke SUGIMURA (1874-1948), the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School and a botanical researcher, who accompanied the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 1927, and Shichiro TAMAGAWA (1914-1988), a curator of the Osako Mountain Museum and involved in the publication of 'Hayachine no Shokubutsu' (The Plants of Hayachine).
Sohei Yoshida, a curatorial researcher at the center, says, "Behind the name of each plant in Mt.Hayachimine, there is a lot of research and connections between people, and you can trace the connections between researchers from rural areas to all over the country."
The exhibition consists of four chapters, the first of which focuses on the faith and history of Hayachine, and the second on the characteristics of Mt. Hayachine from a geological perspective based on surveys by Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundations of Japanese geology.

Even if the ball was changed, the proud fast ball glowed.
Lotte's Sasaki Akira (Ofunato Takashi) made his debut in the Ishigaki Camp in Okinawa on June 9, pitching 30 balls in a game using the World Baseball Classic (WBC), and achieved a 160-kilogram mark.
With two hits against six batters, he expressed a sense of fulfillment, saying, "I gained a lot, and my forkball has become a little better than last year's intensified game."
I measured 160 kilometers twice, clogged Fujiwara and fouled Yasuda.
He took the lead with a slider and built a calm allocation, and Matsukawa who received the ball praised him for his finish, saying, "A really strong ball came, and the hitters were inserted."
Yoshii seems to be satisfied with the steady progress of his fourth year as a professional, saying, "I think it is going well, and it is good at this point."
As the next step, he will pitch in a practice match against Yakult (Itoman, Okinawa) on the 15th, throwing around 40 balls.
"I want to be able to produce more straight ball accuracy and overall cohesion," he says in detail.
Idlib Governorate in northwestern Syria, devastated by the earthquake, on Nov. 9. (Photo courtesy of local residents.)
Gaziantep (Southern Turkey) -- The death toll in Turkey and Syria from a massive earthquake with its epicenter in southern Turkey on Monday climbed to more than 21,000, officials in both countries said.
Rescuing survivors from collapsed buildings in the bitter cold has become increasingly difficult over time.
A desperate search was carried out in the affected areas.
The UN carried supplies through the Turkish border into the affected Idlib province in northwestern Syria for the first time since the earthquake struck on Monday.
Idlib Governorate was the last stronghold of the opposition against the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war, and there were concerns that international support might be insufficient.
Rescue efforts, including the use of heavy machinery, continue at the disaster sites in both countries, but are facing difficulties.
It is said that many people remain buried in the rubble, and the number of deaths is likely to increase further.
According to Turkish authorities, 17,674 people have been confirmed dead in Turkey.
Combined with more than 3,000 deaths in Syria, it is more devastating than the massive earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which killed more than 17,000 people in 1999.
Miyako City plans to introduce its own measures to subsidize energy expenses such as electricity, gas and gasoline costs for businesses in the city who are struggling to secure profits due to rising fuel prices.
We will invest our own financial resources as an emergency measure to support the local economy in a difficult environment.
Businesses in all industries (excluding farmers, forestry and fishermen, and electricity and gas suppliers) are eligible for the program.
The requirement is that the profit margin for the immediately preceding fiscal year decreases from the previous fiscal year.
The subsidy will cover up to one million yen (about U.S.$10,000) per business for six consecutive months from April 2022 to March 2023, half of the increase from the same period of the previous year.
It is expected to provide benefits to about 800 people.

"If I went to the World Cup all the time, I wouldn't have much time to practice during the season, so I wanted to make adjustments in Japan to improve the accuracy," he said calmly.
In the past two races, 5th place in the slope style was the best, and this year I will aim for the podium in two events with Big Air, which I am good at.
This season's World Cup was won by Big Air in each event, and the slope style was second in the second round.
"I will tighten my mind even more, but I hope I can face it as usual without being too stiff," he emphasized his naturalness and seemed to be doing well.
At the end of January, he won the Big Air for the first time at the Winter X Games, where the world's top professionals gather.

The number of people killed or missing in the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 (including related deaths) exceeded about 22,000.
As the winter cold continues in the affected areas, efforts are being made to search for missing people at the site of the collapse of buildings, and there are concerns that the number of deaths will further increase.
According to the Turkish Health Minister Koca, the death toll in Turkey has exceeded 20,000, bringing the total to 20,213.
More than 80,000 people were injured.

Toward the redevelopment of the site, the city intends to conduct a basic survey in FY2023 and present the basic policy of the development plan.
The company acquired the Quatre building and about 29.6 ares of land, as well as a multi-story parking lot at a cost of 94 million yen.
Procedures such as registration of transfer of ownership were completed by the middle of December last year.
The basic survey, scheduled to be conducted in fiscal 2023, will ascertain the current situation and issues related to land use, facility location, and population density in the city center, and analyze future projections.
We will consider what kind of facilities are required in the future.
It will also be included in the city location optimization plan, which is required when using government subsidies.

2nd Decarbonization Promotion Council Meeting at Amami Airport|Nankai Nichinichi Newspaper
The council discusses the decarbonization of Amami Airport. (Mainichi/Kasari)
In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at Amami Airport (Kasari Town, Amami City), the Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council (chaired by Takashi Ando, director of the Oshima Branch Office Construction Division and 13 members), which consists of Amami Prefecture and airline companies that use the airport, held its second meeting at the airport on September 9.
All committee members, including online members, attended the meeting.
They exchanged opinions on setting goals for decarbonization and the introduction of renewable energy, mainly solar power.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) has set an overall goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at airports by 46% or more by 2030 (compared to fiscal 2013) in order to achieve carbon neutrality, or zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In response, the council held its first meeting in November last year and aims to formulate a plan ahead of the other six remote island airports in Okinawa.
Like the first meeting, the second meeting was closed to the public except for the beginning.
According to Ando, who was interviewed after the meeting, the airport's greenhouse gas emissions were confirmed at the meeting.

"Sakasama Real Estate" Okinoerabu branch opens to attract people to the island|Social and Economic News|Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
An opening event for deepening understanding of Sakasama Real Estate through talk sessions held on September 8 in Chinatown.
[Okinoerabu General Bureau] The opening event of the Okinoerabu branch office of the real estate web service "Sakasama Real Estate", which visualizes the thoughts of people who want to rent vacant houses and vacant stores and recruits landlords, was held on the 8th at the community space "entaku" in China Town.
The operating company explained the outline of the service through a talk session.
Masahiro Okubo, the representative director of Tsuginova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), which manages the branch office, said, “By carrying out this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we hope to attract people to the island as a whole and create a flow.”
In contrast to normal real estate procedures, upside-down real estate is a system that discloses the information of the person you want to rent, contacts the landlord, and if an agreement is reached, you sign a contract yourself.
The service was operated by On-Co Inc. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture) and started in June 2020 as a demonstration experiment to discover potential vacant houses and build relationships through vacant houses.
It was the seventh office to be opened in Kyūshū.
It is the first of its kind on a remote island in Japan.
About 20 people participated in the event, including staff from On-Co and Tsuginova, officials from the town halls of Wadomari and Chinatown, and local residents.
Mr. Okubo explained the background to the establishment of the branch office, saying, “With the movement to attract people from outside the island becoming more active, I thought that if we could make use of vacant houses and vacant stores, the town and the island would become more exciting from there.”
"We want to connect with people who have properties on the island or who want to do something, and help as many people as possible to advance their efforts," he said.
On-Co CEO Takeshi Mizutani pointed out that it is necessary to take care of each vacant house and discuss what the local people want to do in this area, what kind of people they want to come to the area, and what criteria to choose.
“The deeper the connection between people, the more information they gather,” he said, calling on the islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

Mercari uses the money you sell for purchases, so I don’t think it’s very convenient.

There may be campaigns such as discounts when using a card?
Does the NSR250R blink when the key is turned on and the turn signal is operated while the engine is not running?
If the battery is normal, when the key is turned on, the ACC, that is, the accessories, will be energized, so the blinker and brake lamp will be on.
There will also be a horn.
However, after starting the engine, the voltage rises, so I feel better.
Can I mix ADATA DDR4 and Samsung DDR4?
It is a laptop.
In principle, if the pin arrangement, voltage, frequency, and other standards match, they can be used together.

I want to play an mp4 file “from one place to another” repeatedly. Is there any free software?
Or can you do it with the software included in Windows 10?

Is this thin hair?
It is the "crack" of the hair depending on the hairstyle.

If you don't want your scalp to be visible, you can solve the problem by changing your hairstyle so that your hair doesn't break.

If you have no experience as a club advisor, it is because there is no one else who has experience (including those who have already been in charge of other club advisors), and it is not necessarily that you did not participate in club activities when you were a student.
I'm a high school student.

Do you live alone?
Is something fun?
I lived alone.
Until last year.
It was fun.
Humans are accustomed to animals, so if we continue to have fun every day, that state becomes our daily life.
If fun becomes everyday life, you will not think of it as "fun" unless there is more fun.
Because I understand it, "everyday life with nothing" is fun.
I feel it.

It is a common story for fake stainless steel made in China.

I think so.
I don’t remember having flu for more than 50 years since I became a member of society, but when I had my antibody levels measured in the city five or six years ago, I had enough antibody levels.
Also, I don’t remember being vaccinated, but I think I probably got the flu without knowing it and developed antibodies without knowing it.

Earplugs didn't work at all. I can hear you.
There really is a painful hell where you can't sleep.
How long will it last????
Is not it something called spring thunder, snow removal?
It'll be over soon.
I have been to several different dentists before, but when I was sitting on that treatment chair, there were doctors and dental hygienists who talked from a slightly diagonal back.
I’m not sure if it’s better to look back, but it’s hard to look back all the time, and I think it’s rude to stay facing the front.
How many of you know that?
How are you doing?
Not only at the dentist, but also at the barbershop and the perm shop.
Which material is cooler, polyester 100 or dry rayon?
Dry rayon is better and cooler.
Please tell me.

How do you become a good person in the world?
Thank you very much.
Rather than thinking about becoming a good person in the world, now is the time to master the work given to you as soon as possible and become a force for the company.

The top plate of the washbasin door has come off, so I would like to ask for repairs. How many shops should I ask?
Please tell me.
There is a decorative board in the hardware store, so I plan the size, process it, and repair it myself.
When you go to the tax office to submit your tax return, you don’t have to print it in color, do you?
Yes, Sir.
When will the amount I applied for in the tax return at the beginning of the year be transferred to my bank account?
I think it will be transferred in about two or three weeks.
You will receive a postcard saying that you will transfer money by postcard first, so please record your passbook when it comes, because it has been transferred.
I have no choice but to wait for a postcard (notification) for the time being.
How do I check my LINE ID?

Can I purchase a ticketless express ticket at E5489 using my VISA LINE PAY prepaid card?
Good evening.
The "ticketless limited express ticket" of "e5489" of JR West will be paid by credit card.
Prepaid cards are not accepted.
The date has passed a long time, but do you think it's okay?
It is vegetable juice.
It also depends on how you save it.
If you keep it in the refrigerator for a long time, you can drink it even after a couple of days, but if you leave it outside or leave it at room temperature, you should dispose of it.
If something happens to your body later, it will be serious.
The monkey brother Shinichi Saruhara of "Abataro Don Brothers" is unemployed, so why can you eat and drink at "Kissa Donbura"?
How much is the payment?
I didn't order anything other than the haiku I paid for in episode 2.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Choose "dry" for the course.
Can I enjoy the movie promise of Neverland only in the movie without knowing the contents?
You can enjoy it.
Because it's a simple story.
Can I write it? It is a story of running away from a monster that feeds on humans.
I think nurses wear plain clothes when they go to work, but is it okay to wear sandals and bare feet?
Well, I will change all the clothes anyway, and anything that is not strange and easy to commute is fine, isn't it?
I envy a house where people do not come at all. Is there anything you lose in such a house?
You will not be able to clean the inside of the house.
Hospitality to customers will also become unfamiliar.
About Instagram.
I (an ordinary person) currently have about 10,000 followers. If someone who does not know this sees it, do you think it is amazing?
Or don't you think anything about it?
What does it look like?
I think it is amazing.
For ordinary people, it is a miracle.
I think he was doing something special.
Problems and setbacks.
I bought it because I didn't have time to exercise, so I decided to rely on the trendy pressurized innerwear.
The body size is H175m W80kg I bought L size.
It is quite difficult to wear at first, but I think it will be okay once you get used to it.
I have been using it for a few days, but due to a problem, I am now using another pressurized inner.
The problem is that if the arm circumference is not quite slender, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve (just above the upper arm) will be too tight and a little congestion will occur.
2, the lower abdomen is loose I stopped using it due to the above two problems.
It is quite tight in terms of comfort, but there is no problem even if you sleep while wearing it.
It's a good deal for those who fit.
I was fine even with 158 cm and 50 kg.
But it didn't suit me because my skeleton was big and I was muscular.
Since it is not a three-dimensional structure such as the buttocks, it is easy to create strange gaps and fall down and does not fit well.
I always felt like I had to pull it up.
I think that it is good if you have a body shape like a stick.
Is it said that it is a safe thinness in terms of thickness?
I was able to boot in tight knee-high boots, not henna henna or tearing feeling, I was able to make it refreshing.
This is lovely.
I don’t want to expose my upper body much, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit, and I came across it.
The top is fashionable with a lace-up back and a one-point mark on the hem.
I am glad I can choose to wear shorts under a bikini or on top of it, 2-way (^.
I don't know if it's durable or how it feels if it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is solid, and I thought it was a bargain that it was this price.
There was no wire on the bust part, but when I touched it, it seems that there is a hard core at the bottom of the pad.
However, it doesn’t hurt even if you wear it, and it follows your breasts properly, so I think it looks good when you move.
Did you change the model from no putt to yes?
(^.
I am looking forward to getting into the water from now on ♪ Thank you very much!
It is a little larger at 45 kg 156 cm M size.
The raincoat is a thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but the manufacturing method is solid, so I think it can be used for a long time.
It comes with two rain protection visors to prevent my face from getting wet.
The strength was no problem, and I was able to use it with confidence even on a bicycle in a storm.
It was not torn after use.
I put it in a compression bag and carry it in a compact state.
It was really a product that exceeded expectations at this price.
I was able to install it safely.
It was attached to the CLA 180 Shooting Brake for the 2016 model year.
Even amateurs can wear it if you read YOU tube and instruction manuals.
Please note that if you loosen the torque screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I dropped one and went missing.
After that, when you pinch the gray connector between the brown and red-green wiring, if you do it with a tapered type such as radio pliers, the force will not be applied evenly and the plastic will crack as shown in the photo and you will not be able to install it.
If you call support, they will mail you a new cable the next day, and the company is very supportive.
When I tried again, I put a lot of effort with the wide pliers as shown in the photo in the instruction manual and it worked.
When I put the last main unit back in the car, it took a little work to store the wiring, but I was able to install it somehow.
After installing it, you can watch DVD, TV, and navigation while driving without any problems.
If you order it with a dealer, it costs over 80,000 yen, and even at specialty stores it costs over 40,000 yen, so I think it is a very cost-effective product.
Less than the price.
To be honest, I do not know why it is so highly rated First of all, the cotton inside is poly, but it is cut in the cushion and has a fluffy part and a sparse part It seems that it has already been worn out There is little cotton overall, and I thought that I would like to try it, but if you do not try the product where the head and body pillow part are integrated, I think that it may or may not fit I thought that there would be no failure if the pillow and body pillow were separate I bought it for 3600 yen this time on a time sale, but I would like to return it In the first place, I regretted that I should be more careful about the five stars reviews
It's neither good nor bad.
Arrival of goods.
I used it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use and you can milk properly.
However, there are times when the sound feels a little annoying and the response of the power button is poor.
I don’t care because I can use it without problems, but people who care about it may be worried.
It's not super quiet <unk> If you use it in the middle of the night, you may be a little careful.
Also, I was worried that the part connecting the attached tube and the machine would fall into the tube, but I entered it by pushing it in<unk> I think it is easy to carry because it is lightweight!
You need a knack for lathering...
I am not sure if it is the worst compatibility with my hair quality or the performance of this shampoo, but it doesn't lather at all in normal use.
(The shampoo I have used so far lathered without any problems even if I use it normally) So, here is the solution I found ↓ 1 First of all, pick up a little less shampoo than usual and blend it all over the hair.
(At this point, no foam will appear.) 2 Rinse your hair once, then take a suitable amount of shampoo in your hand and blend it into your hair.
The volume of the shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to reduce the first shampoo amount as much as possible...I am satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
It is clear that I bought such a expensive shampoo, but I clearly felt that the texture of my hair had improved.
However, to be honest, I was not satisfied with the overall review.
It's a pity that the Quattro Botanico series was taken care of by the face wash goods.
Even though the capacity is small, the cost performance is bad because you are forced to wash it twice.
In addition, considering the scent that seems to be unpopular with everyone, we will strictly give it 2 stars.
It's hard to assess.
There are negatives, and it is difficult to evaluate.
The front side of the blade is cleaned with a blade cleaner.
I think that matching with a razor with good accuracy of the original blade is good.
Positive: As intended, it can remove dirt on the blade, such as sebum and soap residue.
(Only on the front side) If the sharpness becomes poor due to the dirt, it will last a long time.
Negative: The life of the smoother is drastically reduced.
Coatings that are coated on the cutting edge, such as titanium coating and ceramic coating, are easy to peel off.
(If you use shaving 2-3 times, most of the coating will come off, so I think it is better to use this cleaner after that.)
Please be careful with the razor that says not to wipe the cutting edge.
It can be substituted with a fall prevention rubber (anti-vibration rubber) that can be placed under furniture used as a preparation for earthquakes, so I feel like it is cost-effective.
When I use it, the life of the razor is increased by 20-30%.
It is difficult to judge when the razor blade is thrown away, but I think it is when the blade is damaged by shaving and the cutting edge becomes rattled.
In that sense, I think that it is a good product because it can prevent sharpness down by dirt.
(It is just a cleaner and does not have the effect of sharpening.There are times when it feels sharpened, but it seems that it feels so when a small rust is removed.)
I got caught up in a TV commercial.
I bought it because I saw the face of an elderly woman pull up just by applying it once in a TV commercial.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little harder than a regular gel, and I wiped it off with pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it feels sticky and unpleasant, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will unexpectedly enter your skin.
After entering, there was almost no stickiness, and my skin felt like it was sticking to my hands.
The lift-up did not go as well as on TV.
I felt the firmness at once.
I have super dry skin, so this alone is not enough, so I used a certain Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It just feels moisturizing.
I expected that the sagging of the pores would be covered, but it was not covered.
I think that you can try using one bottle and see if it is effective, or if there is a repi.
It must have been hard to put it together, but...
It is a laborious work that summarizes the statements of politicians in the past few years.
As I read it, I was somehow convinced that the statement at that time was ah in the end.
However, when considering its value as a reading material, it is difficult to say that what the authors call "fact-checking" is sufficient.
To be honest, it is not interesting to read.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the major drawback of this book was the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "facts" here is forever true or not.
I felt that it was quite suspicious from the way they wrote, whether they were aware of the fragility (or falsifiability) of "fact checking".
I feel a little gloomy when the current awareness of "facts" among Japanese reporters is at this level.
It seems that many people recommend it, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge of the contents covered in this book.
If you, like a reviewer, are interested in the "fact-checking" conducted by the current Japanese mass media, I think this book will not suit you.
For those who do not improve their scores in the mock exam.
At my school, politics and economics were taught in a printed format, and it was really boring to study while being forced to do it, and before I knew it, I hated politics and economics.
To be honest, I was saved by this reference book.
Now the center this year in high school 3.
I bought this in March and chose it as my study partner for an hour on the way to and from school.
First impressions are easy to understand.
You've reached the realm of God.
When I finished a lap and asked my past questions, I realized that 40 was the average at the time, and I was 70.
As expected, I was surprised myself.
It grows as if you ate something strange.
What you can get from this reference book is not only knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also the power you have and the improvement of motivation to study I realized from my skin that it is synergistic.
Thank you for letting me meet you.
Crime prevention
I experienced two attempts at entrance picking eight years ago, and I have been taking measures to prevent crime.
This time it is a replacement from the camera I bought 8 years ago.
Previously, we used the infrared irradiation 30m type (another company).
This product was written by another person, but the distance that can recognize the face at night is about 5 m.
I agree with you.
I have just arrived and have not set it up, but I am at the stage of comparing the appearance of the camera and checking for defects.
The image quality is much better than the camera from 8 years ago (of course).
It was displayed in four divisions on a 32-inch monitor, but if you maximize the shooting size, there is no problem.
For now, there are no problems with the product.
If you are considering a level of facial recognition other than crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied with night photography in particular, but this price is the best!
I am for crime prevention, but I do not require facial recognition.
Because you won't know if you are wearing a mask or mask (especially at night).
Professional burglars (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
Even if it is small, it seems to distinguish between a high-performance camera and recording.
On the other hand, if you are not a professional, you will be in trouble.
However, recent burglars are bold and clever, so I recommend not only relying on the camera but also using it in combination with various security goods.
For example, you can get a white solar LED garden light at a hardware store for about 1,500 yen (the latest one is very bright and has 6 units).
Since it is solar, no electricity fee is required, but in winter, it does not light up until the morning, so three 100V motion LED sensor lights are also installed.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30 meters to recognize a human figure.
Also, if you think that the threat effect will be diminished because the camera is small due to crime prevention during the day, I think that you need to cover it with ingenuity.
I have a sticker that says "24-hour security camera working".
It is an original product of the security camera manufacturer I used before.
Manufactured products are more effective than those sold at home improvement stores.
The place to paste is the intrusion route of the thief that would not be covered by the camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
At the same time, the instruction manual of the net setting is difficult to understand, so I made it a minus.
If there are any deficiencies after setting up, we will add them.
The harder I read, the more empathy I felt.
If you were born in Japan in 1982, the social situation might be a little better than her, but even with the enforcement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act, the situation is still far from equal.
As I read on, I remembered the painful memories of living through discrimination as a member of society, and I felt suffocated.
Not only in Korea and Japan, but also in feudal society, it depicts the suffering of all women who try to live not as women but as human beings.
Isn’t it time for women alone to stop the emotional conflict and stand shoulder to shoulder against this society?
A drama that makes you think that men are the worst.
This is the story of a protagonist who was sexually abused by his father when he was a child.
Of course, even as an adult, the wounds continue to drag on.
All the men who come out are the worst.
The husband of the main character who seems to be gentle and family-minded is also the worst in a sense.
There is a spoiler ↓ Even if you know that the protagonist’s sister is receiving domestic violence from her husband, you ignore it, and the sister-in-law finally has the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, but the protagonist’s husband, who is a police officer, passes through.
The old mother of the protagonist pretends to be stupid and knows that her husband (the protagonist's biological father) was killed by her daughter, but the daughter doesn't know that (officially, the death of her biological father is a drug overdose).
In short, after the death of the rape father, it seems that he did not let his daughter receive counseling, so it is natural that the main character goes crazy.
Why would the protagonist's daughter want to hear about her dead grandfather?
Do you care about this old man who died so young?
In the drama? Too much.
A few years ago, a heat wave hit France in the summer Many elderly people died, and when hospitals and institutions contacted their daughters and sons, many French people said that they could not pick them up because they were on vacation. It was reported that the morgue in Paris was full.
These people are "dry."
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that they were "dry".
Many of the French ones are completely different from the American ones, and the vague parts give a good aftertaste, but there are relatively many scenes that I thought it would be better to cut.
Professional boundaries
If the elaborate calculations and unexpected accidents that could not be read were related to someone's life, he would have prepared to risk his life even if he had calculated from the beginning to some extent.
She struggles with her own conflicts that she does not show in public, and how far she deceives those around her in order to pass on her beliefs. The script that embodies such a delicate and emotional drama was wonderful.
Even so... Jessica's performance is really great.
No matter what you look at, there is no mistake.
It is truly a professional job.
Sense of use, and then it broke down.
I have used 3 units so far, but this product broke in no time, both in a good way and in a bad way.
The reason why I chose this product was that I used the first built-in vaporizer of 2200 mA, but the battery ran out after 3 sessions at 200 degrees and 5 minutes.
The second USB port is defective.
Charging is not possible.
This product was a product to solve the problem so far, but after re-inserting the battery about 15 times (I used the battery in the charger so that the USB terminal would not break), it became difficult to turn on the power, probably because the contact became poor.
Press the lid to turn on the power.
If you are an ICOS user, you may have some experience.
It's that symptom.
As stated in the instruction manual, batteries other than those included in the package are not used.
The nails and catch part seem to be carved out, so there seems to be no bend.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought it without the Starry logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the comparison with this.
Appearance The size is the same.
The same applies to the chamber and draw.
Liquid crystal This one is more beautiful.
It may be newer than without a logo.
Vibrator This is modest.
It looks like a vibrator on a smartphone.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibrator or the sound is loud.
Cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese...
The accessories are a little different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
Without the logo, it is a lump like steel wool.
Roughly like that.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it broke quickly, it would lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose to return it, so I proceeded with the procedure, although it was troublesome.
It's just ear rubber, but ear rubber.
This flat rubber is really not painful.
It is the best mask of the same type that I have used so far in terms of ear comfort.
Even with flat rubber, it may be twisted, and the part of the torsion helicopter may rub against the base of the ear, causing more pain than the round rubber, but I think this product is not only soft to the touch, but also hard to twist in length.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is good, and not only does it fit, but there is a moderate space between the nose wire and the bottom of the chin = in front of the mouth, so it is difficult to feel stuffy.
It may be because it fits the size of your face.
I don’t know if it fits everyone in the same way, but if you think that all of the other smaller sizes are not good, I think you should try it once.
When I opened the outer box, it was in a vinyl with a central slit like a box tissue, but when I took out the first one, the ear elastic on both sides got stuck and it was difficult to take it out, so I reduced one star by that amount.
The contractor's response is one star.
The price and taste are perfect, but even though I specified the date, I was distrustful of the response of the vendor who ignored it and sent it.
In addition to this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
I always buy it on Amazon, so I know the delivery person.
In order to carry heavy items to the top, we tried to match the arrival date as much as possible, but it was ruined.
It is said that the shipping company is having a hard time because of Amazon, but we are thinking that there is one thing that the user can cooperate with.
I am disappointed in the response of the arrogant broker.
But the price is cheap.
If you want to buy it, you have to include the cost of disposal
There are many complaints and I think it can not be used for a long time.
I think it is better to consider including the cost at the time of disposal.
For reference, some local governments have centers that accept bulky waste for free or at low cost if you bring it in.
[Sitting comfort] The seat surface slopes slightly to the left and becomes more wobbly, so I feel very tired sitting down.
If you move even a little, you will make a loud noise.
It is too noisy to use at night.
This is the biggest problem, and I feel that I can not continue to use it.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions are only rough illustrations.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many errors.
There is no explanation about the direction of the seat and the support base installation Some people wrote in the review that it tilts forward, but there is a possibility that the direction when mounting the seat and the support base is reversed.
When installed correctly, the lever for height adjustment faces backwards on the right hand side, and the dial for adjusting the direction of the spring on the back is in front.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural in the forward direction, many people will install it incorrectly.
There are no such basic precautions in the instruction manual, and you have to assemble it through trial and error while looking at a rough picture.
Incorrect description of the contents The contents list at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that many buyers are looking for 8x20mm screws that come with 12 screws.
The 8x20mm screw is already inserted on the chair side, so be careful not to look for it in vain.
The machining accuracy is low, and it seems that there are combinations that can be inserted with the same screw hole and screw, and combinations that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, it is very difficult just to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with screws inserted like this.
I couldn't find any spare screws in the manual.
[Other] The black part of the surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring, and it is whitish in some places, so it is better not to expect beautiful things like product photos.
An explanation of the deficiencies in the instruction manual and a supplementary explanation of the above installation method were sent to the email address registered on amazon 2 to 3 days after the arrival of the product.
Originally, these should be released immediately after the product is shipped.
It is a completely meaningless act because many buyers have completed the assembly within 2 to 3 days after the arrival of the product.
Well, um...
I am a big fan of Thermos and have been using the Thermos straw type for more than 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use.
1The mouthpiece part of the straw is made of a harder material than ever before, and the grooves fit perfectly into the main body, so the mouthpiece part of the straw can no longer be removed from the main body!
I desperately tried to take it off and my nails broke...
2 Only the tip of the mouth of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush can no longer enter.
3 The mysterious part called the valve attached to the tip of the straw is thicker than the straw brush and is dramatically difficult to wash.
I have never been dissatisfied with the straw type so far, so it is a bit of a shock.
It is really stressful that the mouth cannot be removed from the main body.
The good point is the outstanding cooling power as usual.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and wash it the next day, there was still about 50% of the ice I put in the day before.
I do not drink hot, so I will continue to be a straw type.
Please improve it in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
I will review it for the first time.
(This is the impression of an amateur who bought a doll from scratch for the first time and has little knowledge of wearing doll eyes for the first time.)
When I attached it to the obitsu doll, it was very cute and I was very satisfied with the light.
However, it cannot be installed unless you push it in with a little hard force at the time of installation (entrance).
I think the method is different, but I put tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping It was my first time to ship from abroad, so I expected it to take about three weeks, but it arrived in 8 days (near Narita Airport) earlier than I expected.
However, I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
If you look at the Amazon shipping description earlier, it is still being shipped.
There was no air in the eyes and there was a lot of bubbles on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it was safe.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information okay even though it is an email from outside the country?
I felt doubtful, so I will make it minus 1.
I think that the product is a very good deal for this amount at that price without any problems.
P.S. Doll Eye 8mm model iPhonese
It's a little small (the working area is small), and it's very charged.
I ordered it after seeing the size notation, but I felt it was about two times smaller than I had imagined.
It is larger than the A4 size, but the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than the A4.
I was planning to use it when repairing electronic devices and making Gundam plastic models, but it is difficult to use unless you have a B4 size.
If you use it only for soldering iron work and use another tray or mat for other work such as assembly and disassembly, you may be able to manage.
It is impossible to put tools, place parts, and do further work within the area of the magazine size.
I thought about ordering another one of the same type to double the area, but it was too charged during the work, and dust and cut parts were all absorbed, so I think it would be difficult to keep using it for a while.
A fatal defect.
After struggling to open the lid of the battery box, I finally opened the lid using a rubber anti-slip sheet, but when I tried to load the battery and close it, it did not close.
At this point is out.
Highly evaluated person!
Does the lid of the battery box close???
In addition, there was a small saran wrap instead of the protective seal of the product.
Is this a used item???
The only explanation is written in English on a small piece of paper.
There is no explanation of the illustration and I do not understand how to operate it at all.
It might be better with the other fingers...
I found a good product!
I bought it right away.
I use it for pinky rings, so if I don't use it a lot, it won't be perfect and it will be a little rough ...
But I think it's good for other fingers.
But I think it's a good idea merchant.
For the price.
After all, you should not seek quality in this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was crushed.
I put it on and the size is just right.
People with thick earlobes may be tough.
Maybe I should have bought a patternless one.
Oh, my God.
The design is good, but it is big when you put it on your hand I wonder if the effect will not fade even if you put it on your feet?
In Eastern Hokkaido in the middle of winter...
As you can see in other reviews, the electric heating wires are only 110 x 80, and the arrangement is horizontal rather than vertical.
I bought it because it was more expensive than the mattress type because I wanted to warm the entire futon uniformly, but I thought it would be better if it was bigger, but I can’t help it because I can’t check it at the store like a famous manufacturer.
It can only be used in combination with a hot water bottle and an N-warm.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
It's pretty good.
It is small and has enough airflow.
Batteries can also be replaced with spares.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it feels good as shown in the photo.
If it is on a slippery desk, it will be blown away by your own wind power, but if you put a handkerchief on it, there is no problem.
The sound is not noticeable even if it is "medium" when used outside / in a family restaurant, but it is noisy even if it is "small" in the office.
It is necessary to understand that it is just an accompaniment when going out.
Also, even if it is "small" for office use, the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It is ideal for a scene where you sweat a lot on the go and escape to a family restaurant and cool down at once with "Large".
However, when thrown into the bag, the power button is rarely pressed and it can be left spinning without knowing it.
It would be nice to have a device such as slightly retracting the button (depressing it) or holding down the weak point of the first press.
It is an essential item in an era of intense heat that is dangerous to life, so it would be helpful if you could make a better one.
Multifunctional light speaker
I use the weakest warm color and put it in the bedroom.
Better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color by touch.
The white color goes well with any room, and the color light changes with the gradation, so it's beautiful.
Also, if you touch the color you like, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it glow according to your mood!
Since it is an LED type, a long life can be expected.
As for the sound quality, I think it is more than satisfactory enough for my ears as an amateur.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it is multifunctional.
There is a large speaker at the top.
Bluetooth pairing is possible with mobile phones, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
If you pair it with a mobile phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
In addition, since it is compatible with MicroSD, it can also be linked with a personal computer and can play music as an mp3 player.
Uchikomi and Piano Practice
He started to challenge DTM to prevent blur at the age of 66.
I bought an audio interface and this unit.
At first, I was focused on playing the piano, but I became addicted to it and practiced every day.
I downloaded the attached sound source, but the protection did not work well, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but the free piano sound source sounds good, so I use it for piano practice.
I'm glad I bought it.
There is a feeling of being deceived by the appearance.
Is this the wrong product?
It will be a long sentence.
The synthetic leather of the Doushisha office chair (bouncing armrest) that was used for four to five years deteriorated and became tattered, so we considered purchasing a chair with a bouncing armrest made of non-synthetic leather.
I searched for home improvement stores and furniture stores, but found nothing suitable.
I was worried about not being able to check the actual product, but I compromised on the appearance and price of the design and bought this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is a reserve of one screw.
[Caution] The included hex wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I did not know the oil adhered to the hex wrench, and the main body was white, so I was impatient when the oil got on.
Assembly was completed in 40 minutes.
Completion and product confirmation.
The revolving armrest has a different hardness on the left and right, and the left is heavy for raising and lowering, and the right is light and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest has a weak fixing force and immediately hangs down with a click.
The seat feels hard with non-renewable high-density urethane foam and is not comfortable to sit on (weak elasticity?).
The competition mesh on the backrest is harder than other mesh chairs, and if you wear thin clothes, your back hurts.
Although it is a small thing, the height from the seat to the ground was 530, not 550(The height of the seat height is important for tall height) And the legs that support the casters are not made of steel, so the durability remains doubtful.
I use a cushion that I bought separately, and the mesh fabric part is covered with a towelket because it seems to deteriorate (damaged) quickly.
I felt that only the fit of the back was good for me at 186 cm 80 kg, but other than that, I think it is a product with low satisfaction, and I feel that it is a product with a hit and miss.
After all, it may be better to sit down and buy an office chair while looking at the actual product.
I received an Amazon email from the manufacturer with a purchase greeting, so should I inquire about the armrest and headrest?
It is under consideration.
Well, is it like this?
In my environment, it seems that I can see BS4K on the right turn, so I bought a Pixela 4K tuner with a low price without much expectation.
As an experiment, I was able to watch free right-turning broadcasts such as NHK BS4K, and I was able to watch it beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV I bought at the same time.
(Sometimes the image stutters) As soon as I bought it, an update came and it became compatible with recording, so I made some scheduled recordings and watched it, but I wonder if the external 2.5-inch HDD is also affected, only the image stops during playback or frame skipping occurs.
The user interface is not praised at all, and it is decided that "4K broadcasting can be watched".
By the way, I feel that I can only chase and play the recorded program during scheduled recording, and I accept this as a positive function that I can record in 4K on the HDD.
You may be disappointed if you buy with various expectations, so don't expect too much.
I hope it will be improved with the update.
Thermal insulation is good.
I have only used the heat retention function yet, but when I put two 500 ml plastic bottles in it, it became warm in about two hours and hot in two and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but I am worried about the fan sound when idling stops, but I do not feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the smell like a chemical substance discharged from the fan because it was still new, so I needed to open the window regularly and ventilate it.
As another person wrote in the review, the burr on the part where the shoulder strap is passed is terrible, so you need to break the burr with a flathead screwdriver.
It's really fragile.
Today, two months after I started using it, it suddenly broke.
I liked the feel and size of the keystroke, but it would be meaningless if it broke.
I use a PC all day for the work of processing images, but the volume automatically becomes 100%.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
The earphones hurt my ears and I can’t use them, and the volume is so loud that I feel uncomfortable using a PC at night.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds, and the volume display repeatedly appears and disappears on the computer screen.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, so you can not use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard every time.
The Enter and Backspace keys no longer respond.
I don't recommend it at all, but if you are in the 1,000 yen range, you may want to buy it for a try.
If you are lucky, you can use it for about half a year.
This is a six-month warranty compared to the one- to three-year warranty offered by other companies in the same price range.
The short warranty period tells you how fragile it is.
The goods are the best, the packaging is the worst.
The product is different in color and I love it.
If you are looking for a food stocker, I would definitely recommend it! !
However, there was a gap enough to roll around in a large cardboard box, and there was no delivery note, so the packaging was the worst.
When I opened the box, the lid was also removed.
The product is recommended, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but for now
When I replaced the lid, I lost the support, so I bought it.
It plays a role in terms of the stability of the lid, but it is a delicate plastic product, so if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make a disgusting sound.
You have to choose the one that matches the thickness of the lid, so be careful when purchasing.
A bag with cute paws.
I have a dog and when I was looking for a bag to go out, I was attracted by the fashionable gray bag and bought this.
It was built upright, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so it didn’t feel that heavy to hold.
The zipper moves smoothly and there is no such thing as a snag.
It seems to be easy to move for a long time.
It is also very compact and easy to fold.
Even if you fold it, you can see the design of the meat ball, and it is cute even if you put it.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, I fell in love with the appearance and low price at first sight and bought it!
TSA locks have been my favorite for a few years, and I have a few others, but they are convenient.
And as a master of forgotten or lost keys, the number lock is recommended.
However, to be honest, I put the most important point on lightness, so it’s good. If you want durability and security, the zipper part is a cloth for a week, so if you cut it with a knife, it will break in an instant.
Also, the combination of the zippers is sweet, so I would like to have a device that overlaps each other.
It is recommended for carry-on if you are overseas.
For the time being, I used it on a Shinkansen trip, but it was comfortable.
It is difficult to choose the size...
Because it is wide, it is difficult to buy shoes.
Converse and buns wear 24 cm.
MRL996 is also 24 cm.
At first, I thought it was tough, but once I got used to it, I was fine.
This ML574 was certainly tight when my sister said that 24.5 cm was tight and let me wear it.
It felt like my little finger was hitting me.
Therefore, I bought 25 cm.
When I arrived and opened it, it was big ...
When I put it on, it is a little loose even if I wear socks.
I was worried about returning it, but if it becomes tight at 24.5, it will be troublesome, so I think I will put it in the insole at 25 as it is.
I bought Team Red, and it is bright red and very good!
There are many black and white monotone clothes, so it will be brighter if you wear this!
165 cm, male in his 40s
I ordered the L size appropriately, but if you are similar to the following specifications, I recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm It is a typical metabolic belly.
<Easy to use> In the water, the rash guard rolls up, probably because the waist part is loose.
Swimming while fixing the part that turned up.
Especially when I was careless in the Jacuzzi, I could see my belly full of metabolic syndrome.
Also, if you walk while exercising vigorously up and down, you will turn up from the bottom.
The fabric is durable and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples being transparent.
At this price, you can be satisfied with this design, but I think it will fit better if you buy a smaller one.
There was a gas leak, but...
If you want to buy this Colt 25, you can ask someone who can disassemble and assemble it, or you can ask someone who can disassemble it while taking a digital camera picture, so those who are not confident can not recommend it very much, but those who think that it can be broken may be fun I bought another black Colt 25, the trick to disassemble is to remove the left side while holding the trigger with the thumb of the left hand, I managed to disassemble it without flying the parts, When assembling, I applied silicone grease to the spring and fine parts and assembled it while fixing it with grease, When disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the safety screw, remove the two screws on the left side of the body so as not to damage the tip of the barrel, and remove the front site and the inner barrel with pliers.
I was wondering what kind of quality 188 yen is
You can use it when you need fast turning and torque.
It is light and small, and above all, simplicity without vanity is good.
There was no rattling when I installed the bit, and I thought that it was an amazing cost performance if it was 188 yen.
Also, how about durability?
It may not be used very often, but I think it is good to put it in the tool box.
I bought it together with "1/4 inch hexagon shank magnetic quick release driver knurling bit holder 60/100/150 mm" from the same distributor.
There was no problem here, or rather, it was quite good for the price.
The controller won't work.
The aircraft will not be able to operate on its own.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the aircraft moves in an unexpected direction and cannot be operated.
This product is better not to buy.
I would like to warn you.
It is a terrible product.
Although it is wired, I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It is reliable and has not yet broken even after being used for a long time.
It can also be used for PC games.
Amendment I was able to refund the Amazon gift certificate by returning it as a defective product within a month, so I think that was good.
Does this increase your calculation power?
I think it is suitable for children who understand calculations.
Isn't it impossible for a child to understand calculations to some extent?
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, when I give tools to the master, I let the screen slide up with my fingers. I tried it myself, but it didn't go smoothly no matter how many times I did it.
In short, it may be easy for people who are used to DS to slip. ?
I don't like illustrations of manga characters, or rather, I think that DS etc. may enter from the fun of the screen ...I do not feel familiar for some reason.
The method of calculation is also a way to compete for time, for example, how many questions are correct in how many minutes.
I understand how it feels to be in a hurry with exams ... but don't you get impatient and calculate?
For some reason, I don't like the sound of the gong when it's over.
Isn't it better to make the sound more pleasant even though you are doing your best?
I feel like I lost 6,200 yen with this.
I can understand the price of this half.
I am sorry, it has become ☆ 2 for this reason.
The persona songs are great, after all!
Persona 3 reaches ED.
5 played until the middle.
Persona 4 is already installed on the Vita.
What I can do has not changed from Persona 4 of the previous game.
Because there is no story, it feels shorter than the previous work.
The song is really cool!
Just listening to it will make you feel better!
The Persona 3 characters were in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Somehow Junpei looked handsome (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so there is no freshness ...If you think so, 3 feels more profitable.
As for the sound game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see if the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if you wear it with the background.
There are plenty of assist functions, so I think that even those who are not good at sound games can play.
If you are an expert in sound games, you can turn on the challenge function to make the game more crunchy.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not a bonus, but a solid 4-disc set, so if you like persona songs, I recommend this one.
It's a shame.
I liked the color of the dial in the photo and bought it, but the actual product has a bluish color but is close to black or charcoal gray.
And it was not a double buckle.
That’s why I was thinking about buying gold, but it’s pending for now. Can I give up because the price is cheap?
Postscript After the review was posted, I received an email from the seller apologizing and exchanging for a new product.
The subsequent processing was also quick.
I think the response was very good even though it was a cheap product.
Added 4 stars to the correspondence After that I also bought gold.
The color is almost as shown in the photo and I think it is very beautiful.
However, the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the explanatory photo is obvious.
That's the only pity.
It gets very heavy in the evening.
I used it for SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setting, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (Settings < Mobile Communications < Turn on data roaming from the communication option), and it worked well.
The instruction manual attached to the product did not seem to have much to do with it ...?
However, around Gimpo Airport, I had been grasping 3G for a long time, probably because the radio wave condition was bad.
When it went out into the city, it became 4G.
In the evenings and at night, communication sometimes became very heavy, but thinking about it now, I may have reached the maximum limit of hundreds of MB per day.
Better than I thought.
I used SoftBank Z4 for two years, made it sim-free, used it on Ymobile, and the Z4 started to feel bad, so I was looking for a used Xperia, but I found this phone that was new and could be used with a cell phone and bought it.
Since I was using Mobile Suica, I was worried if I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so it looks like an iPhone 6?
Since it does not play games, the processing speed is the same as Z4, and I have the impression that it is a little faster. According to the review, fingerprint recognition is slow, but I have the impression that it takes some time to recognize it, so facial recognition is faster, so I use it here.
I thought it was amazing because it looked like an iPhone I changed my Android to Ver9, and I was able to shop satisfactorily.
What I was interested in Can be a little smaller No strap hole * Corresponds to the case with strap hole I have not tested water resistance A little heavy I'm satisfied although I've only used a little yet I recommend it
