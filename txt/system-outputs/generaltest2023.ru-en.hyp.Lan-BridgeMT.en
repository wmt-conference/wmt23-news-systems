July issue is traditionally handed over during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to subtract strips, when the soul is torn on Shabrol.
m Nevertheless, we will talk about the MIFF next time (for now, I will only complain that this year the inexplicable idea has finally been strengthened in the minds of the organizers that happy ticket holders are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and completely insulting principle, which no normal film festival in the world sins), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at the Cinema Tower.
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the title character of the Robert Rodriguez-produced film "The Predators", and inside the magazine, try somehow not to miss the story about Christopher Nolan's "The Beginning" (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most - without fools - expected film of the summer.
Also this time we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here there is certainly no need to advertise anything specifically, and it is clear that the author of "Suspicions" and "Ropes" - this is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mezenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Neitan, Kim Newman, Zairea Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexei Prostyakov, Seraphima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mur Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Olly Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina London tsar Evelyn Salt, despite a brilliant track record, suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to fish out at all costs.
in a corner, she will repaint into the black we are used to and she herself will go to seek the truth.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of the fatal boy-woman promises to further consolidate the position of the actress in the action genre.
She will arrange one accident after another, run along the walls a la "Matrix" and like children spread strong men in the same strict suits.
So beautiful and should save the world.
Here he is, native, who blew up and repaired the world "Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis he was the most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman - the most stylish and impeccable incarnation of Evil.
And at the same time, all together it turned out not to be a boring American-type blockbuster about saving humanity, but the sweetest live carnival.
What Besson did for 13 years between "Element..." and "Adele..." I don't want to remember.
, to put it mildly, he did not sit idle, but all this screenwriting-producing hustle and bustle and rare, exhausted directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." - hardly.
watch this movie, it seems that 13 years before us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, real, lived in a small apartment on Montmartre, drank wine in the cafe opposite and composed a story about the most charming adventure seeker.
retelling the plot (albeit with embracing features), fueling expectations, in this case it is more sinful than usual.
All the incredible drive here lies in the fact that behind every turn or remark there are surprises waiting for you.
And all as one pleasant.
Either a girl, or a vision
ADEL'S UNUSUAL ATTACHMENTS
The most dashing adventure movie of the decade hints that "Adele's Extraordinary Adventures" will begin as "Amelie," head towards Jurassic Park, continue with "Indiana Jones" and "Mummy," and end with "Titanic."
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy's comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin starred in only three films before Adele.
the actress for her role in "Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a Cesar Award.
the director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to appreciate the special effects, scenery or tricks, but fascinates himself, like an old-fashioned novelist, exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: "Forward, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time, Besson deals with genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy, who has seen enough of old films and has read Jules Verne.
Manipulation of platitudes, not denying oneself cynicism and not embarrassed by risk
R Luke Besson
PLAYED: Louise Burguzn, Mathieu Amalric, Frederic Belle, Gilles Lelouch
: Strange things happened in Paris in 1912.
The city was overwhelmed by an ancient monster, which awakened the old medium to life.
the fossil creature is being chased by the police, as well as the famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Natural History Museum and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has less to do with the beast itself than with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
22 JULY
"Adele..." - the case when parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it along a new path.
So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster action movies, with the aforementioned 'Indiana Jones' (he was bowed and ridiculed here), and finally with the same 'Fifth Element'.
Besson's style in this film is made up of verbal trickery, acting clowning and plot balancing (circus terms are quite appropriate - the union of the two arts here is organic and stronger than ever).
A few words need to be said about Adele herself.
in her was embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer, who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality, but the purest courage and courage.
In the cinema, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of duty macho or fluffy romance.
: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical breather, who only spins under his feet (only his knowledge of zoology turns out to be useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun spending time in the society of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, quite skittish Luke Besson showed unexpected creative dashing, recalling that the line between the preferences of bored visitors to mega-malls and high-brow art-house regulars is easily crossed by films for cheerful madmen.
Adventure movie game without sadness, fear and reproach
DEATH ROOM
horror with a claim to psychologism and political context In 2002, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film was criticized, but liked by the public and made good money at the box office, and most importantly - caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director ended up in a factory, spitting out new horrors according to old patterns: Bay set out to remake all the horror classics in the form of remakes and commissioned Liebesmann to prequel "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
Criticism again squirmed, but the public liked it again - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new scary", emphasizing the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, his example shows how a whole genre rushes around in convulsions, trying to invent new ways of influencing a fed-up public: the naturalistic blood of splitters merges with the catch-ups of slashers.
The plot resembles the "Saw" franchise, but without liters of blood.
among the prototypes - Vincenzo Natali's debut painting "Cube". The film is no longer made by Michael Bay.
So in "The Death Room" Liebesman was forced to take a different path: dull carnage or monotonous running from a maniac, he preferred the smarter option - almost without the notorious bloodshed, but with a psychological game and mysteries.
evil doctors here play cat-and-mouse with their subjects.
And three men in a locked room try to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
not only they pass the test, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is addicted to wild experiments.
: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
t they are put in an isolated room and given to each pile of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
The survival game begins, with government agents watching the glass closely.
Too brooding for the terrifying, but not enough for the candid arthouse
He can have small talk, and walk around with a fire extinguisher, but he can't miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is circumspect and adamant in her sympathies.
by her father's courtly lifestyle, she is hurt and candidly spies him, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's "Showgirls," diving into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of family conflict is not at all the difference of generations or the choice of profession, it is, one way or another, already predetermined, and the unsuccessful attempts of the girl to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan together with Pavel Bardin made a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Three and a Snowflake".
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of an adult daughter in the comedy genre.
The delicate plot winds around the love adventures of the heroes, who all the time talk about psychology, and themselves, apparently, according to the witty director's discovery, emphasize the language of gaze and gesture.
fringe plot branches (a girl crippled in a car accident, whom Alexei wants to marry, an alcoholic athlete performed by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are drawn only dotted.
especially sorry for the line about the business of repurchasing football players, and remained behind the scenes.
: More than anything, the agent selling football stars cares about the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
compassionate dad himself changes bab, like expensive shirts, but the daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry the guy "with the rod."
What is the disappointment of a businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the audience of the film, the author got "in the top nine": "Don't look for a problem where it doesn't exist". can not say more precisely.
Their resemblance is simply striking.
In both tapes there are detachments of harsh guys, soldiers of luck, forced to take revenge on those who set them up and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The heroes jump on almost the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - and here and there something explodes, stuffed with dollar bills, and a whirlwind descends on the scenery from bucks.
Even the villains, dressed up in expensive costumes, are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played in both cases by Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role is Neitiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to shoot about dance battles - "Dance Brotherhood".
Chris Evans was recently invited to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Sylvain White was inspired by the comic book series that came out in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - the 80s comedy series.
surprising how they, without saying a word, led different material to an absolutely identical roaring denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies, evoking a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you choose between these two tapes, then "Losers" look a little more likeable and clearly victorious in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
t least here is Zoe Saldana, who is very into Bazooka
: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of hardened commandos working for the CIA set up their own superiors: a helicopter with children, whom they tried to save, was blown up, and the soldiers themselves from that moment are considered dead.
But they are alive - and intend at all costs to take revenge on the scoundrel with the languid voice who set it all up.
It's all sweet, but, frankly, it's worth spending an hour and a half of your life on White's painting, only if you have no more interesting options at all.
Made from recyclables, conditionally edible militant
Simple story about a fugitive Romanian convict
Romanian low-budget film, which won a prize at a prestigious international film review.
In principle, having only these data in hand, one can vividly imagine both the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without any doubt, cinema promises to be acutely social.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough.
High probability of participation of non-professional actors.
Also in the picture there will be a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian, as our festival winners prove from film to film, - especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of issue, one can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were lectured about Bresson in the early 80s.
The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on the play by Andreea Valean, whose work is in particular demand among the directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All this is true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - understand us correctly - it is not at all abusive, but advisory: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development, when the faith of its representatives in the methods
his work has not yet wavered.
And this moment must be caught: only thanks to this faith can one endure an hour and a half spectacle of the Romanian colony for minors and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pisterean (whose history, despite the abyss, separating two cultures, can easily be
to convert into an exhibition a la 70's, with a cowboy, who decided to walk from the dungeon, from where he would soon leave, to the nearest saloon).
PLAYED: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
: Having cut off his four years, 18-year-old prisoner Silvio (Pistereano) is soon to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with him to Italy.
From that moment on, the young man's behavior becomes inadequate.
affair with social worker Anna further pushes the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the picture.
What nonsense is all this!
want to watch - watch.
Not a bad debut, suggesting faint hope that a decent direction will someday grow out of the Romanian arthouse
Cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-writer Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandry, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
, probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to look at the ZO), especially, if you like, when different objects every now and then strive to jump from the screen into the hall), tolerably written, and, most importantly, , there is not a single lower-belt joke here, because of which in "Ice Ages" you had to shamefully press into a chair and cover children's ears with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the blatant asexuality of the protagonist, which in turn was dictated by the unwillingness, no matter what, to touch on the topic of pedophilia.
For the 'adult' part here, in addition to the main conflict of single parenthood, is responsible for a rather harsh black humor (which, I would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
Overall, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
feels the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers, who have thought through every little thing so that the film is liked by all categories of citizens.
t that we want to see children's cartoon characters eat cannibals or destroy an atomic explosion
: The bearded villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of astronautics have transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to resort to the help of children to carry out a grand plan and eliminate a young competitor.
n some advanced orphanage he adopts three female orphans - Margot in glasses, Edith in a hat and Agnes, in a lethal degree of cuteness comparable only to the cat from "Shrek".
As is usually the case, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The protagonist is drawn with Christopher Meledandry - both of them are bald, nosy and prone to black humor.
n the original the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Siegel.
In the finale, Grew dances the part of Travolta
A wheelbarrow rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a conditional desert, from which three pairs of the most solid tits come out.
Exactly.
By themselves, the bearers of this gift are not so significant.
The camera confidently captures attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately report good news - the whole film is maintained in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things in female beauty and the casting was such that what happens on the screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of funny things happen.
, 'killer' and 'stripper' dig in the sand, douse themselves with water (don't ask, why), carry some kind of blizzard and periodically fight quite fiercely.
s believe that a swearing heifer with generous forms, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth - this is cool.
stuff" is primarily focused on classic sexual performance tapes.
Rick Jacobson filmed episodes of "Zena -- Queen of the Warriors" and "The Wonderful Wanderings of Hercules".
close-in-spirit film at the Moscow box office - "Stew for Jennifer".
even cool, when the bitchy beauty spins the bandit's eggs, the battered punk fights in a pair with a Japanese schoolgirl, this is accompanied by a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and the intrigue is unwound through an endless number of flash-backs.
In general, for a film fetishist, real Klondike pleasures are found here.
understand, of course, that Jacobson and his gang, filming this trash-parody, had a lot of fun, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren't for the physical data of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
, it can be assumed that this game came to us from the night channel for adults (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
PLAYED BY: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
: Three dangerous beauties are brought to the desert by a mafia boss, who has a substantial amount of diamonds hidden somewhere here.
nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to claw, fight with each other and periodically arrive from somewhere scumbags, as well as regularly kiss and squeeze.
As the case progresses, it turns out that all three are not the same ones they presented themselves as at the beginning.
, according to the author, so even more fun.
Product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest painting "Judgment Day", stripped down to "Mad Max" for the indigent, Marshall made a serious mistake.
The bloodthirsty and biting ashes restore the director's shaky confidence.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy Magnum Opus is not shy about its modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious category "B" film aesthetic.
There is in the picture both the hooligan courage of "Dogs-warriors" and the beastly cruelty of "Descent".
The "Marshall Plan" to clean the "ash" from the stuck-on post-gladiator film dirt, on the whole, worked.
n McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion in 2011.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham, among others) are stern men, trying to marry their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
death and the savory details of natural defecation in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which cost a lot of budget money, was directly inspired by the introductory distribution in the German forests from the now standard "Gladiator" Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason you absolutely do not want to try to convict Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.

: Lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
the remote outpost, where centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is serving, is ruthlessly defeated by the Pictish reconnaissance company.
saved by a miracle, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a bunch of other Roman survivors, try to sneak away from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadistic Itain (Kurylenko).
So far, the subtle arthouse artist has managed to win only sharp-character supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after "Centurion" the situation will change.

"The visionary-artist of Corbine's scale and the magnificent George Clooney - this is a film union, imprisoned in heaven," boasts a studio press release.
n addition, this project - another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney's life - with Italy: the shooting took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel The Very Secret Gentleman, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the place of the English narrator was taken by the American in the title, and the main character turned from a gunsmith-illegal into a simple murderer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to figure out his last case and finally get rid of the lucrative craft, his icy heart melts under the spell of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Rutten), with whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
"Jack tempts fate, - reads the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well be the wrong one to pretend to be."

s from him have already arrived for Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McEvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
nternational action movie Maxim Korostyshevsky is being filmed in Crimea under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune".

Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3
s the film company Ragatoipe, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay with Hitler".
However, the place of the main character and new lover of the hero Shia LaBeouf is likely to be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she has to take accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not frighten the seasoned viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful requalification of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron (Monster), Angelina Jolie (Disrupted Life), Jessica Lang (Blue Sky, Tutsi), Kim Basinger (Secrets of Los Angeles), Jennifer Connelly (Mind Games), Gina Davis (Hazardous Tourist) and First Vice-Miss USA-86 Halle Berry (Monster Ball) started out as a fashion model or starred for fashion magazines, eventually earning a well-deserved Oscar.
t succeeded in acting (also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Belucci and, what is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
They have high rewards clearly at arm's length.
In a word, Rosie has, from whom to take an example.
Valeria Gai Germanica, who deserved special mention by the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone will die, but I will stay" and who directed the scandalous television series "School", received the position of creative director on the MT television channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
n particular, it is already planned to shoot its own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanica also started casting new presenters.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into "Vykrutasy".
The main theme of the film remains the same - provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to meet his bride, but lingers to coach the street children's soccer team.
new development received the second storyline of the picture.
Actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital's bride Nadia will be played by Milla Iovovich.
As an additional intrigue, there will be a third - the ex-fiance Nadia Danya (Ivan Urgant).
, thus, in addition to the question of whether the yard team will win the football championship, a dilemma arises, who will get Milla Jovovich.
e to the constant delays in the filming of "The Hobbit" and the presence of a mass of third-party projects, Guillermo del Toro abandoned the position of director.
Studios persuade producer Peter Jackson to take matters entirely into his own hands, but he is only willing to agree to this step if it is urgently needed.
s named as possible successors are David Eates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose Jackson-produced film "District No9" received an Oscar nomination.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.

from the rigid schedule, critics and filmmakers raced at high speeds between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the "Pearl" hotel, in which press conferences and round tables flowed, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
behaved and the heroes of competitive films - in almost every one someone ran somewhere: confused Asians from "Gustarfighter" Yusup Razykov and "Other Heaven" Dmitry Mamulia were looking for their missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "Live"
Those same comments were happily wrapped around the finger of the detective hero Klim Shipenko "Who am I?" - who, however, was remembered by the public rather for the presence in the frame of a totally naked Zhanna Friske.
heroes of domestic show business also appeared in a couple of competitive films - in the film "Elephant" Sergei Shnurov played a trucker, taking a circus animal for slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets talked about his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in a film production for two "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to an alcohol duel because of the lady.
, however, the business events at the "Kinotavre" also had a tangible imprint on the show - none of them were boring.
n the round table, dedicated to the fate of the Russian art house, a picturesque quarrel with critics was arranged by the chairman of the foundation for the support of domestic cinema Sergey Tolstikov: "Do you generally read articles in the press that I read?" - he asked the audience menacingly.
"I write them," replied President ERVEZS, confused! Andrey Plakhov.
s did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexei Fedorchenko's film "Oatmeal" was suddenly filmed from the competition program - he will go to Venice: the selectors of the Monster decided that the extra Russian show was a hindrance to them.
"Kinotavr" did not interfere with the giants - in Sochi films of large festivals were shown more than once: this time, say, the film by Sergei Loznitsa "My Happiness" participated in the competition, which in the spring competed with Mikhalkov and Wirasetakun on the Azure Beret.
Nikita Sergeevich on "Kinotavre" visited the film of the former Cannes competitor and said that he liked it.
Jury president Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa's picture at all - but under pressure from colleagues he was forced to give her a prize for directing.

But a cast-iron baba descends on the house, on the head of the hero - the unjust hand of the punitive organs, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
sometimes it is useful to work not only with debutants," said producer Sabina Eremeeva triumphantly from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics saw it differently: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull the "internal debutante" out of the luminary of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - now in our cinema bison are moving after young people.
Not the other way around.

The process is as follows: aircraft at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break" with these reagents clouds, going to the city. Particles of substances condense around themselves moisture.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and precisely in the place where the impact on the cloud occurred."
For ten years, work has been underway on a remake of the sci-fi film, in which Michael York played the main role.
Recently, Carl Rinsch was appointed director (he already has a remake of "Creatures from the Black Lagoon" in his graphics), who became famous for his commercials.
with the project were previously associated the names of Brian Singer (X-Men), James McTeague (V stands for vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Throne: Inheritance).

The remake will be directed by Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.

This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script for it.

I wanted to bring more power to the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China, says Chen.
Chinese women in our time run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gon Li embodies this power.”
For the second time in a row you play an imaginary character.
Is this an accident?
ity.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I was presenting two films here (at the Kinotavre and the Sochi Film Market - EMRE).
And in both I play the dream woman.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he introduced me, and for many, it probably seems that I am like that in life.
Dream girl.
Your co-star Alexander Yatsenko does not look like his hero at all.
How did you find a common language? What is he like on the court?
He is absolutely not what it seems at first glance.
I saw him and thought, "Yeah... not just that I'm going to have to."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and present, we would not have succeeded.
And this contact happened to us literally a few minutes after we met.
We are great, I'm not afraid of that word, we became friends.
I told him about all my fears, about all my experiences, that I am afraid that I will not succeed, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and this help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this, because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere we watched the whole movie holding hands.
How was the shooting in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol - this is the city where I came for the first time.
I never had a tour there, neither on vacation, nor in my childhood I did not come there.
This city has a special magic, some character, its charisma.
And this is the city to which you want to return.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always has time everywhere.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play love in this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which many, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are you easily given emotional scenes?
You know, I'm a non-professional actor.
And I am very, by nature, a gullible person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I, in fact, believe in his hands and I want to be a test, from which they will sculpt.
I perfectly understand that from the outside you can see, and I, again, ask for clues and talk to the director, for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he has preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, in long, many-hour rehearsals, we come to the organics you're talking about.
And how did you work with the director of the film, Klim Shipenko?
I got high from everyone, cameraman, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I enjoy working with crazy people so much!
I saw the same when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly such a situation.
t sleep, not eat for days - and still, at least thunder, at least hail.
And if something didn't work out - it was a disaster, and something urgently needs to be done for it to work out.
n this atmosphere of madness works very easily.
And it seems to me that when people are so moved to painful bigotry on what they do, it can't fail, because too much energy is spent.
Which scenarios do you refuse?
What are the criteria for selecting the material with which you will work?
I don't want stupid things, stupid dialogues, films that don't say anything, don't carry anything.
do not want to work for the sake of simply appearing on the screen once again.
Do you have any proposals, projects, which you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals and plans right now.
I'm not the kind of person who paints graphs.
script came, he interested me, today this premiere happened.

while we are working on the November issue, film festivals are going on almost continuously in Moscow: American film - "Amfest", "2toggo\", the other day "2-t-1" will start, followed by the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of the acquaintances constantly discuss that someone needs to be boycotted, and someone needs to be supported, for some - well, sorry - very vague reasons.
at the same time, when one of these festivals solemnly closes with a terrifying view of Chu4-projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
least of all I want to grumble about this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall looking at giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then you will be shown them.
meanwhile we have no pixels: 'Throne: Inheritance' (continuation of the classic picture about virtual reality), 'Let me in. » (American remake of the beautiful Swedish film), “Uncontrollable” (another Tony Scott approach to the subject of trains) and a wildly detailed account of how films about Konan, the barbarian, the destroyer and the governor were created.

The serialized fairy tale about a cute bespectacled sorcerer is nearing its conclusion.
And even if fans of the series have read the book for a long time and know how it will end, and those to whom the word "Expelliarmus" does not mean anything, will remain at home, the title of the main blockbuster of November for Harry is actually booked.
In the studios, by the way, there are also not fools sitting: in order to stretch the audience's pleasure and finally get the most out of the franchise, the seventh film decided to split into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwards will stretch until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
History of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story about paradox.
tells about the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, quarreled five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg is as brilliant as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social exile with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a number of reasons: partly out of anger at the world around him, partly out of sporting interest and partly simply because IT'S "cool."
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of "Social Network" are evident from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his five-minute ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the sonorous, tough dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength here and do not soften until the very end.
Same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins, actors who did not look like each other played.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other using computer graphics.
with Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara landed the lead role in Fincher's next film Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.
R David Fincher
PLAYED: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ermie Hammer, Joshua Pence
: Frowning and withdrawn Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a turning point on the personal front from the gate, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook grows in popularity, relationships with the few friend-companions begin to unravel and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its part: warm, sunny in places, even in the dark remaining cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate legal battles.
n addition to the film's stream of incessant discussions, not much happens: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal travails are unlikely to draw even an extra paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher in this not too generous story?
after viewing, there is a persistent feeling that "Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case - an important artistic device.
just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing roughly the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now, when the daily solvency has become even higher, the policy is no longer implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, he dreams of being the center of attention.
(Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hummer and Pence), meanwhile, stomp their feet: who said it, that the rich, beautiful and athletic can't also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, "Social Network" could well turn out to be a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what else is in his business - positive or negative?
And what kind of social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a swindler?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close a book if it contains even the slightest hint of something similar.
But here it is not even necessary: in their version of history it is not at all important.
“What is it like to feel beautiful?” - asks in the song Tre Vea Nez “WaBu Wotz’te A Vsp Map”, which precedes the credits.
The hero does not know.
The film prompts the answer.
Zuckerberg - representative of the lost online generation, which has a weak idea of beauty and even less - of feelings.
tasteful made-for-character drama about a high-profile Internet-era court case
In the early seventeenth century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames did not really begin to appear among people of unknown origin.
the name "such-and-such, such-and-such son".
that is, patrononyms were in use - nicknames after the father.
But sometimes, for example in the case of father remarriages, they used the matronym - the nickname for the mother's name.
- just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna".
small landowners really did without surnames for a long time - why her, when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serf princes Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the XVIII century. all had surnames without exception.
In the nineteenth century. even small landowners did not keep the man on the ground, but let him go to the castle - let him earn by handicraft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where he had to enter his last name.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released to the throne.
So, they already had surnames.
Metropolitan forensic experts flew in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminalists from the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the case of a gas explosion in a house on Lineina, 39, according to the NGS.
According to investigators, the defendants, Irina Urbakh and Yevgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious organization "Mezhregiongaz", examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked sloppily, and the prices for their services, on the contrary, were inflated, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
n the eve of the tragedy on Lineina, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house No. 39, where they changed stove hoses.
So, in one of the apartments they put a hose for water instead of gas.
However, Kavun denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a leak and an explosion of the gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially.
This led to a significant building collapse, which resulted in the death of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of a house explosion in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.

nflooding specialists were able to prevent by closing the dam the day before.
On Friday in St. Petersburg, the threat of flooding increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
marine flash flooding was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
Potential flooding could become the 32nd in a row, according to the St. Petersburg edition of Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closing of the shutters in the Gulf of Finland, the water was kept at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters above the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been opened again, the water level has dropped, and ships can again walk along the Gulf of Finland.
Note that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland monitor the water level situation.
This prevents flooding, which can follow increased winds.

techniques at first, back on Thursday, were going to use a robot to cut the detonator from the bomb, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to the local press, to use the "slow burning" technique of explosives.
In the process of this combustion, an explosion occurred.
n the Second World War the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
n the eight-month intensive bombing campaign alone from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as the "Blitz," 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.

The most feminized area of scientific knowledge - medical sciences, in which the share of women is 64.4%.
In the technical sciences alone, men predominate, with women accounting for 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is 10.2% more than in the Republic as a whole.

The probability of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its reduction.
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have taken place recently.
On the one hand, the terms of foreign trade have deteriorated markedly - prices for Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand - the situation in the economy is better than the October forecast.
Shift in demand structure continues: consumption remains subdued, private investment slows, but budget spending grows.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks generally increased.
Therefore, in the current year, the probability of a rate increase exceeds the probability of a rate decrease.
the expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," said E. Nabiullina.
n addition to the more pronounced influence of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, a rapid upswing in consumption in the face of elevated inflationary expectations, should the factors that are holding back consumer activity weaken.
nd, there is a growing shortage of workers and productivity growth lags behind wage growth.
There are also still risks of further tightening of sanctions restrictions.
f future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted increase in pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than assumed in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have diminished.
On the contrary, the probability has increased that some rate increase may be needed in order for inflation to meet the target of close to 4% in 2024," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual funds (FIFs), consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from the current retail mutual funds.
This will allow the management of the remaining liquid assets to be launched and the resumption of operations with investment units.
If more than 10% of the blocked securities are included in the retail mutual fund, then the management company must allocate them to a separate closed mutual fund before September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued new fund shares in an amount equal to the main fund shares.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities into a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the event of the sale of such securities, management companies are required to pay the owners of investment units at least 90% of the proceeds on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
n addition to summing up the results of the industry, the experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analysis and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia the passenger turnover of air transport decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation - by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger transportation amounted to 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the level of the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative sustainability of the industry was influenced by state support programs.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights, prepared by the Federal Tourism Agency.
Also, to ensure the accessibility of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, developing regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines. and to capitalize "Aeroflot" by 52.5 billion rubles.
despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of subsidies to the industry by the state (so far allocated 25.3 billion rubles), in 2023 passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6,4%, up to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, up to 103.0 million people", - share the forecasts of PSB analysts.

Austria is once again tightening controls on the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people remain at the border in cars waiting to cross it to the Austrian side.
Thus, it becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
f existing agreements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and end up between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is required.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna followed a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the commonwealth's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants, who arrived in the EU and requested refugee status, for the first time exceeded the figures of 2016 and amounted to more than 330 thousand.

Argentina's migration service began to suspend and cancel the validity of residence permits (visas) of Russians, who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
Florence Carignano, director of the service, told C5N about this.
What we are doing is suspending the residence permit of those Russians who came to get a residence permit, because their child is Argentine, but at the same time they spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country) ", - she explained.
, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian is considered in court, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended, because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came again," she said.
o warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left could have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to the denial of entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission attributes the incident to the fact that the authorities of the republic could have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them flew in on February 7, two more - on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but specifically these three were ordered not to enter the country.
They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the law on migration, where one of the grounds for being prevented from entering the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," said Pauline.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine migration service, by a court decision, allowed pregnant citizens of the Russian Federation into the country, said lawyer Christian Rubilar.
an hour ago they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quoted him as saying.
r noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
t foreign parents of a child, born in Argentina, it is easier to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows you to make short trips to 171 countries without visas, including to the EU states, the UK and Japan, RBC notes.
January 2023 The Guardian newspaper wrote about the "birth tourism boom" in Argentina among Russians.
According to Polin, in 2022 from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women, who are going to give birth there.
In 2023 this number may grow to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that in 2022 about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.

Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have traveled abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
Argentina's migration service did not let six pregnant Russian women into the country, as the purpose of the visit, which was designated by them, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the TV channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them confessed that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not let the Russians into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure for action if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is in the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and also she cannot clearly tell where she will go to rest, then suspicions immediately fall on her from the migration service.

g named the causes of sleep problems
-somnologist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about food and habits, which interfere with healthy sleep.
As noted by the specialist, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
We are talking primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bed should be limited, because they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "torn", which means that the body does not fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop eating caffeinated foods 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, difficulties with falling asleep arise.
Negatively affects the ability to fall asleep and alcohol.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent night awakenings.
n addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, somnologist recommends giving up spicy food in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
healthy sleep is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the optimal is the air temperature of 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of increased body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, you should not abuse heavy food before going to bed, because it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also recalled that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and usual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.

The problems that arose among pregnant Russians with entering Argentina were explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of an influx of people wishing to have a child in Argentina, the country's authorities have begun to more closely monitor the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
complications with the entry of pregnant Russians into Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in the massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
It is reported by "Lenta.ru" with reference to St Petersburg University professor Viktor Heifets, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that in Argentina they do not approve of turning the country into a transshipment point, and not a final one.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will still have Argentine citizenship, but the decision to grant the Argentine passport to the parents after obtaining the residence permit will be made by the court.
f it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, they may be denied citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by "law of the land", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport makes it possible to visit 170 countries without a visa, including the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke the residence permits of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the motives for the trip.

with yourself or in the hall, i.e. for yourself to define the technology: to pour coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
Get an answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Specify the volume.
hear that 300 ml.
a person before the fact that there are no cups of this size.
Here, they say, a paper cup, 300 ml.
, this is the third such case in Green Okolica in my memory.
ly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I wanted. I asked her myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Green Circle Cafeteria and Green Circle - parties to the same medal or organizations that are not related in any way?
If not related, there is understanding.
If connected - why did the food and trading enterprise known in the city for its service and quality come down to the rhetoric of a stall at Kazansky railway station?
Rhetoric because such a case, I repeat, has happened to me for the third time.
I do not rule out that what happens is not only with me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that it acts on purpose.
, I hope I'm wrong.
Please write down the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to access the service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw numbers with Nikulin Yu himself.
And now with children, nephews.
Like the situation in the circus, the programs too.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
From almost any point you can see the arena and the backs sitting in front do not interfere with you.
The circus is very chamber, family!
this time we went to the New Year's program.
a little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a number with tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can't take pictures with animals in the foyer.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
In general, a very pleasant place!!
wish you prosperity and delight us with your numbers!!!
stroy liked the developer, chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
They use quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to see the complex, when there were not even walls yet, so that we could see everything live, although we looked at many apartments and not a single developer offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The most exciting thing is the gentle, dense forests, eh, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks, like me, are boring and short.
The longest in sector e, there is even less.
But overall great atmosphere, lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Excellent Master Peri!
did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, in the cabin clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a wardrobe and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come for an order by the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application, and I wait at the window sill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Today in business such a service is unacceptable!
Service answer "care" - we try.
even without apologies, just - it's not our fault, it's the program.
Neither call to warn, you did not find any other technical possibilities to communicate with permanent previously loyal customers.
s "try", and business must work.
Thank you all, everyone is different.
We will not order more from you, and we recommend it even more.
spoiled mood, waiting for guests, the hostess's apology - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
u Mashinu expected to receive months in 3-3.5 (as agreed), but the fact turned out to be 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania performed).
As a result, I am very pleased with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and a normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
lodge for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary dishes.
In the presence of detergent and sponge.
of the shortcomings can be singled out only too little space, in the bathroom a terribly small shower.
Space for storing snowboards or skis is not provided, and there is nowhere to dry things, I had to take a dryer from the owners and shove it in instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
So in general a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
ffordable prices.
There is wine and beer for those who want to drink.
Moscow, I recommend
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
There are all the necessary amenities on site, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good repairs and all amenities.
Beautiful and aesthetic place, they took a walk during their visit to Kaliningrad.
Liked it very much, and Russia in miniature, and Lakes park and landscape.
In winter there are many natural slides for children)
very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly buy here, the prices are low, and the quality is at the level!
Very sympathetic staff, will prompt and answer all questions of interest)
Everyone recommend this shop to visit! ❤️
The location is convenient for anyone.
For me personally normal.
t is served quickly, if any of the visitors are not dumb.
convenient.
The staff is attentive, they will prompt, send, advise even if they did not come on the reception days.
In principle normal.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was done quickly, prices were adequate compared to other services.
I thought of a remote control, and they were so smart, they did everything for me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with 2 hour delivery on March 8th.
6 hours later flowers in packages, as if stolen (barely enough paper to wrap flowers).
, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
compared with the photo on the site and the color turned out to be completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to recalculate and it turned out that there were an even number of 20 tulips.
Support on WhatsApp to my indignation about the color and number of colors replied "apparently they mixed up the color".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
I think this is an extreme degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office about the fact that they refused to give me a check.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next.
I do not recommend anyone to contact this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to master Samira, to dye and cut my hair.
I want to cancel Master Samira's Professionalism, she does her job perfectly, I'm always happy with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and Klie always remains satisfied with the result.
To all relatives and friends, I boldly recommend this master.
All her work is always done at the highest level!!!'
Many thanks to Master Samira 😍
I was in this gaming club , I can say the prices are excellent , many gaming computers , there are also drinks and food .
f minuses, some broken keyboards fly off buttons, if you take "usual game process", then the compasses do not pull well :(
therefore estimate 4
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to study in his group, and the mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
Super-attentive administrators, professional coaches.
organize themed holidays for children, keep clean and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and practice.
6-year-old already holds the blow well, strong OFP.
Recommended for kids, moms and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
The work is carried out with high quality, caring, everything is specified.
You can always talk to girls about anything!
The third time was !
I will not regret anything!
Finally I can grow my hair after lightening !!!
Vita is also studying colorism.
Therefore, it is she who will soon be able to combine blon with keratin!
And your hair will tell you THANK YOU ,
master Elena Polyanskaya is a very sympathetic master, she clearly explained everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
Also during the repair of my car provided any assistance.
As well as gratitude to the master Valery Ushakov for careful and professional work.
I was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out with high quality.
The only thing that confused when registering for maintenance was not enough correct information on the work regulations, when appearing for maintenance the regulations were more clearly explained.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
needed a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve the real estate transaction, the employees very kindly met and helped to draw up this certificate, although they could refuse, since it is not their responsibility.
Thank you very much!
very sincere people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, did not regret that she came to this particular hairdresser!👍
Nahida made impeccable melding, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it to everyone❤️
I really liked it in the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Restored for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
Went on an excursion, also great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
We have known Olya for more than 3 years, we use the services regularly.
During this time we saw how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged friends, which only causes admiration and trust.
m with a calm soul we always leave our ashes.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be picked up/taken away by zoo taxi.
And they will also bring clean and delicious ones)
fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for your care and attentive personal attitude towards our pets
y Los Restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
Before visiting, it is advisable to book places in advance, especially on Fridays!
Nice well-groomed zoo.
Less Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
There were 300₽ adults and 170 schoolchildren at the entrance on weekdays.
There were few people, they enjoyed walking, looking at the animals.
d impressed)
In Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
There are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices on the territory, clean toilets are free, they also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend 👍
Salon at the highest level!!!
Very satisfied with the services of cosmetologist Natalia Kuznetsova, I only go to her.
I do various facial cleanses - both hardware and mechanical.
100% satisfied.

now I'm happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
Great club with huge space, pool, sauna, hammam and great coaches!
Of the minuses, a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club like a public bath!
Particular emphasis on the women's section.
On weekdays, starting from 19:00 there are a lot of people!
troika and then only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken Timur, but I can be wrong.
quickly, told everything +/-, everything intelligible, the son also decided to draw up a card, and alas the consultants are busy with their own affairs, the clients are waiting, the consultant approached the son in the end, who was up to the light bulb, several times delayed 6v the negotiation room, that fun discussing, in the end the son left, without drawing anything up, for forgiveness the consultant said, well, whatever you want, whatever you want, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
New office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
, it is a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
very large selection, good quality (the fabric is resistant to the appearance of rolls), the staff knows their assortment, they help in the choice of styles.
You can dress both a slim girl and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are located not far from the subway, there is even a small parking lot.
!
n September, he celebrated his birthday.
, in terms of service and quality of food, I liked everything: low prices, medium-sized portions, so you can eat, or order again.
The only complaint - booking a table.
When ordering, he indicated the number and everything that was required, after which he immediately called the bot to check the phone.
Then nothing.
When I came to the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table was not booked.
fortunately, there were free places and they managed to accommodate us.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent "Price/Quality" ratio.
!
went cleaning on a recent weekend.
For the first time I see such organized staff, who treated many of my questions with the utmost reverence, suggesting how and what to do for further treatment of the cavity.
From the bottom of my heart, I recommend, the only clinic where they do not want to heat my memory with money.
Good shopping center.
There is everything!
Large range of goods.
Diversity of stores.
You can always find something to your liking.
From food to gifts.
no more foot in this store.
bought a washing machine, said that we are out of town, so we will take it ourselves.
The manager in the hall said where to drive up to the warehouse, to the question "will they load" ? said yes. ))
in the warehouse took out without a box , to the question why ? They replied that everyone loads like that.
when I began to insist , put two strips of foam plexus , like and so it will fit !
refused to load into the trailer, they say it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery )))
when she said that then I would refuse the order altogether, they said "yes, whatever you want, we don't care", in the end one nevertheless got down to the point of going down the ramp and helping my father to shove the car into the trailer.
experience such boorish service for the first time.
Good shopping center Cleanly neat. A large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic" entertainment children's center "Nevidalia".
On the lower floor there is a large Hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large parking convenient location.
Good supermarket of cosmetics, underwear and home goods.
Wide range, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, will advise.
Everyone will find something they need.
Good place to spend the evening.
very good staff, nice establishment.
I advise everyone to never make a mistake in choosing. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will go super.
visit)
We express our gratitude to Chasova Marina, who was our funeral agent.
came to us on a call, she took over the solution of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was in touch all the time and informed how things are going.
Thanks to her, we carried out a loved one with dignity.
Everything was formalized, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, well aware of the state of loved ones, gave advice, how it would be better and just humanly sympathized with us.
This is a very good specialist in his field.
Thanks for everything.
many good reviews, I turned to "RemStirMash" and I was appointed master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for service.
Everyone discussed and set a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call from the morning from the master and a statement that he could not come, a complicated application (how? and where is "completely free?") and, if he can, then instead of the appointed 14.00 he will appear after 18.00.
again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander he can come, but in 2 hours.
What are these tricks?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all scheduled business on the side!
In short, the wise master Ivan arrived, repaired the breakdown, for which he is thanked.
So don't fall for empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
First there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then they looked into the telescope.
t was not very organized, children climbed to watch several times, adults crowded and could not let others watch.
The objects we looked at with the telescope were both the size of a regular star, and without the telescope you can look at them for free.
The girl answered the questions not very accessible, not understanding that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600r.
, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
medium price tag.
Sit, eating 2-3 dishes for two (very large leeks) + a cocktail, about 2500 r👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho highly recommend to try.
Price 420 r for 0.5 liters.
In general, the restaurant itself has very tasty cuisine, I don't know how else, but I really liked it, I advise my friends to definitely go there)
Great store, I have been buying goods from them for quite a long time, since the very opening.
Goods of good quality.
bought a faucet, already five years have passed, and it works well and in good condition.
Therefore, when they did a global repair in the apartment, everything they needed was taken right here.
Great gas station!!!
very conveniently located, there is also stability in the center and side of the region, generally convenient)!
Good gas quality, I have been refueling twice a week for more than 2 years, no problems, great price!!!

The staff is always ready to help you choose.
took a note to his daughter, for study, because her note covered.
Helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! 👍
Sommelier works.
helped with the choice of wine, because such a large menu is difficult to figure out for yourself.
Interesting, charming Vasily has experience working with sommeliers, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
Sudaka - magically, respectful chef.
Children's menu as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. i ate pizza, she is here FIRE!
m was appreciated by adults, and children with ham and mushrooms.
Husband ate smoked ribs - this is a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
Good staff, all smiling, friendly.
We liked it.

Work schedule, from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends and holidays.

Convenient drive, its own parking near the entrance.
5.
Wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different performances.
Today we were at the Performance "Tsarevna-frog".
At the moment, this is the best of children's performances.
t was very interesting, lots of dolls, special effects.
Even my son, 14 years old, just went for the company, and said that it was a very good idea.
s vacationed with her husband for 10 days in January 2023.
succeeded on "5", liked everything!
In order:
On the day of arrival they called, clarified what time to wait for us, gave information about the transfer cost (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 price 850r), got there quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, it was completed quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
ll hulls have elevators - that's a big plus!
2 local rooms are spacious, the floors in both the room and the bathroom are warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in 5 buildings).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in the 5th building.
clean, change towels and linen as you wish, but if you do not ask to change, then still change on the 4th day, good quality linen.
Well-groomed territory, everywhere benches, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
The minibus takes you to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
5 minutes before public transport stops.
Hello guys in the dining room, always wish you a good day.
decent food, but here who goes for what, everything suited us perfectly, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and meatballs or etc., vegetables as a side dish every day, pastries of their own delicious, more than 4 drinks, coffee cereal, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, only cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, temperature 11-16 C°, sunshine.
liked everything, really rested.
There is a desire to come again and it is in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the swimming pool and the exercise complex will not be put into operation in any way.
Thanks to the entire team of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Flight" since August.
turned 4 in September.
like everything very much she, the coach praises) this is the most important thing.
to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I would never have thought that my daughter is so flexible!
ng through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to take a look at this promising institution - and we didn't lose!
affordable prices, and incredibly tasty pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, even the crust is not left.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in a word, I recommend :)
happened that I got to the Tomarov hospital with high blood pressure and a high heart rate.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, orderliness, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
Diet, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, everyone puts both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
ng there is a dropper, they will come in, they will ask about their well-being...
I used to do heart knots, but to do so - for the first time (unfortunately, I don't know the name of the doctor, young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Claudia Feodorovna!
Real professional: attentive, competent, gives an exhaustive answer to any question; picked up the dosage and medications, from which both blood pressure and heartbeat returned to normal, which she could not achieve before after seeing other doctors.
Thank you very much to the head physician of Mevshe Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the well-coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, and the nurses, and the thieves!
Visiting the customer service left a good impression.
In the hall met the administrator.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently help customers with all the questions asked.
The specialist assisted in filing the application and gave an explanation of my question.
For a small store, a very good choice of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, chemicals for the house, various trifles.
works around the clock, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
Classy, when there is a place in the city where you can ride from the mountains.
Bugel lifts and on weekends of course the queue gathers 40 seconds downhill and 5-10 minutes queue.
But in general, it's cool, immersing yourself in a positive atmosphere and winter, even if the roads are dirty and damp.
Contacted the service to repair iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
Directly contacted the master Alexander, who explained all the subtleties of the repair and immediately outlined the price range.
Thanks for the repair, everything was done with high quality.
The masters are very pleasant in communication, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when replacing the parts, the camera was hit, the focus was lost.
immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as soon as possible, everything is working properly.
This service has good specialists, with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, acceptable, have.
If repairs are needed again - I will definitely contact you!
, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires close, prompt and qualitative attention of restorers.
Therefore 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the keepers.
Excellent engine
Feedback concierge, garbage is removed, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
n opened in our area a good, cozy resting place.
There are all the necessary shops.
and varied in terms of food-court food.
s are located in cozy areas.
No boredom.
Well, we visited, tried...
The interior has nothing to do with a cozy Italian cafe...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in the dining room.
Pizza... well, who hasn't tasted better, then I'll like it, it seemed somehow faceless.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter is always behind you and your interlocutor, on the contrary, almost always looks you in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We won't come here again and I don't recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf - the best master I ever had - either cut her hair and put on make-up.
very carefully and qualitatively does everything, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
My daughter also leads only to Lena.
The atmosphere in the cabin is amazing.
Thank you very much!
and I broke down on the way, good people from KatResurs quickly reacted and helped!
Respect you and prosperity, more such good people!
And in the server there is clean and good!
came to the concert of Sergei Chigrakov.
Great concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come this year to the planned concerts.
Quiet place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music plays on weekends and holidays!
Nice staff, and sympathetic!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
highest rating, love this place ❤
Park in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is room for both children and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football pitch, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more pluses in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't get into bad products.
Often promotions and discounts.
, which is close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
in the bar twice, everything was loved, polite staff, delicious dishes and most importantly - great music, DJs know their stuff.
The only, second time disappoints the lead singer of the group "Hands Up Band".
not only does he not sing very well to put it mildly, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, especially when they were the songs of the band "Hands Up".
Somehow this is illogical (performing in the bar Hands up, in the group Hands up Band).
Vacationed in early March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
n honor of the birthday they gave a room overlooking the Kremlin.
Clean the room every day.
Water refill, tea, coffee, shampoo and towel change.
s just dumped the head.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
f you want to order a meal from the restaurant to the room, pay for the service 20% on top.
At the restaurant, prices are slightly overpriced.
Taste for three plus.
The water park was included in the cost of living.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the massage therapist was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: neither goodbye, nor a good road.
n the staff at the entrance did not even help open the door seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
This needs to be worked on in order to keep the mark.
Great place to get together with friends to steam.
Large and comfortable steam room, there is billiards, open-air pool, karaoke.
delicious food, fresh drinks)
Workshop level!
In a short time, he has already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husbands and 1 wife).
It's all right.
The quality of work is on top.
Special thanks to the master for the careful attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful basketball school!
My son has been walking for 5 months and he really likes it, he looks forward to every workout.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and sincere atmosphere.
Great store, staff will go, I order online myself.
Excellent store location.
Plus there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good.
Good AV store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria for several tables.
Frequently - everything is fine!
Nice pool!
about "frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalievna really likes the child and is professional!!
Clean locker rooms, warm water, hair dryers!
I love cake bakeries, service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee always on point.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout never made coffee, until I reminded them, they did, it is impossible to drink, it stinks and the aftertaste of spoiled milk remains, I decided not to finish and just left.
Last time in my coffee there was long black hair, replaced.
Please be more careful, how can I be a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
chic eyebrows it's here!
Victoria adjusts perfectly, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
with warm wax, which removes all fluff well, and the brows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type and hair and skin, thanks to which the paint lasts a long time.
better not do eyebrows!
Thank you so much for my mom's organized move!
- always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, with high quality.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my acquaintances!
All at the highest level.
We have been treating the teeth of the whole family for a long time in Novodente.
recently treated my son's teeth 8 years, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because We accept by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a shawarma lover, BUT when I want something harmful, only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat with lots of stuffing.
And I don't understand why, but it never leaks from me.
Often when you finish eating shawarma, you can no longer eat it because there is a lot of water sauce, well, in short, fuuuu...., but not here.
therefore you guys are the best 🙂
Good teaching staff.
The food in the dining room is always fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held during the school year
Nice store, polite staff, good assortment.
However, a big minus is that the goods that are brought, apparently, are destroyed right on the trading floor.
Sometimes there is little space to pass between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are right on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a remark to the organization, and not to a particular store.
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
magnificence, which is reverently cared for.
I had a double pleasure from the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere of the cultural center.
while we waited for the start in the hall, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that it was really coming out.
Looking for a clutch pack on my MB Sprinter.
Accidentally got into this online auto parts store.
, pointed out the Vincode, said wait)
10 minutes later they called back, offered several options.
Since the personal-working car did not save and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
5 minutes later they called back and said that this is good news for you.
If you take not the whole basket + disc + survivor, but take LUK basket + disc set and separately squeezed LUK, then it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
Picked up the clutch went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it was found that a flywheel was still needed and the faster, the better.
I already knew where to turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment on the call (the first time I also paid on receipt).
The next day the flywheel was in his hands.
The car is pleased with the new flywheel and clutch, I am pleased that everything came quickly, that we went to meet.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a success, but with nuances.
a two-seater table, it turned out that they put me for a 4-seater.
But it doesn't matter.
It's just strange that they didn't warn.
for four, the fish did not succeed at all.
with competitions, made on the school level verpoint, to be honest, not so much.
about the music everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was top notch.
Everything else seems nitpicking.
Thanks for the event
I leave my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
Only people work in this institution, who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OB department, and in the maternity department, and in the postpartum department.
But I express special gratitude to E.Yu. Kotlyarova, this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and N.V. Yarantseva, this is the midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much, for your help in the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Lovely shop.
Large assortment of balls, always quick formation of order and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, with always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the establishment on recommendation.
amazing food, no program, a little cheeky waiters, but we were in a great line-up with children and celebrated an important event, were friendly.
There was no fiery plateau, the children waited.
You can safely go for a good kitchen.
