Diego Cocca is Mexico's new national coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup with the United States and Canada for the first time with 48 teams. Cocca will succeed Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago.
Geesthacht: New seed-planting signs to encourage planting
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament and the Council adopt a common position on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the working environment.
The 'Geesthacht opbloesem' campaign also includes information on what is currently blooming there - currently in white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blossoms" is an action of the Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth since 2015.
To ensure that the project is not just an action of nature conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also reaches out to the private gardens, explanatory boards are being placed to the plants. About 50 signs have been put up so far. Passers-by should be able to find out in this way what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will repot at home.
The first week of January saw the start of the wild hazel season.
More recent shrubs such as winter scented heath cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the earth of the buckets on Bergedorer Street for a year now, showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been thought of with further signs. "The winter scented heath cherry is a very broad-bushed shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide", is there to read among other information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bed plants are now showing flowers, but in the first week of January the season has already started for the wild hazel.
Ernestine, 102: "I am young because of the steppes"
Munich - Dance God Fred Astaire would be proud of her when he looks down from the sky at Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday at 3 p.m. at the Mandolin Motion Show Academy, three ladies meet for a tap dance - together they are 277 years old, excuse me, young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich-born (January 15, 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh" Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap dancing are my life, I can't imagine life without them".
Ernestine is joined by Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) in the dance.
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life with dancing, acting and singing".
Elfriede Widmann, 79, is the chick in the tap-dancing circle, and she says: "We're just having fun with our dance teacher, Sissy Engl".
Tap dance was developed in the United States in the 19th century and is now known worldwide. With two metal plates, each more durable than the wooden soles originally used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced during the dance that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussionist. The English term for this is tap dance and the French claquettes. The Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dance. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well-heard sound while dancing.
Sissi Engl, 77, is the soul of the dance studio at the Ostbahnhof station. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, we welcome big and small, old and young".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "I keep myself young by exercising", the 102-year-old told BILD. Her advice to everyone is: "Exercise, eat healthy and don't drink".
Analogue in dialogue - the limits of the digital
As digitalisation progresses, some people are turning to analogue technology
The speed with which our daily lives have become digital has left us with little time to set up rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden: In 1985, if you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen, you had three options: either you were one of the lucky six percent who had a private line, or you were one of those who had someone from that exclusive group in the neighborhood who could call their relatives for a bottle of Radeberger, or you went to a pay phone, not to mention the smell of the plastic earpiece and the clicking of the coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to call and see the other person's face - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What to do in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old economist has 14 days to do so.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had resigned unexpectedly, the pro-European head of government under massive pressure, as she herself announced as the reason for her resignation - apparently because she was opposed by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova, Ukraine's neighbor, is suffering economically from the war, with inflation running at over 40 percent and the tiny republic hosting tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Chisinau Parliament, the pro-European PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, holding 63 of 101 seats, so the confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians have gained popularity with Kremlin support.
Those were the costumes of the celebrities
2023 is the year of the big celebration in Veitshöchheim, the fifth season is in full swing and the celebrities are not far behind.
Markus Söder, the father of the state, did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the child hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franken came Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich with his wife Anja.
The Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is going to space.
The president of the Landtag, Ilse Aigner, chose no less than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace and love mode, Bavarian Health Minister Klaus Holetschek with his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder, also known as Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter, with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy, Finance Minister Albert Füracker, with his wife Evelyne, who wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff in Fasching: Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, with his wife Gerswid at his side.
On the waltz: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to the craft with his costume, and his partner Tanja Schweiger, a councillor of the district of Regensburg, does the same.
The political opposition was not to be missed, of course.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The SPD leader Florian von Brunn is in the mood for a walk with the SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
Royal was chosen by FDP leader Martin Hagen, who came as Harry and Meghan with his wife Anisha.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and on the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and the draft budget for the financial year 2000 and the draft budget for the financial year 2000 respectively.
If politics doesn't work out, he can still do magic.
The Commission is also proposing to make the EU's digital policy more transparent.
Back in the 1920s, the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, the BR director Katja Wildermuth and the BR cultural program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side kick against the climate activists by the Frankish crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The first mayor of Veitshöchheim was not to be missed either, Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: A bold eighth in the World Cup sprint
The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and closes in on his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is a TV expert on site, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partially strong fog did not prevent the perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the race platform. On Wednesday, it was enough to successfully defend the title with Norway's mixed relay.
There is little doubt that the chase will be followed by the third man, and once again, Bo is the clear favorite in the chase, with his running form being so outstanding that he can compensate for shooting errors with a degree of startling ease.
After the routine had given up all chances for a medal with a penalty round in the mixed relay and it had only been sixth, it did not go better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in the lying down shooting and two more standing were a great disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen he won surprisingly six years ago with a 0.7 second lead over Bo. It was one of only three career successes Dolls has stood on the podium so far this winter. The Beijing Olympic eight pulled after his weak performance without saying a word and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel ranked 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will focus on the value of democracy, with both looking back at their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden has been pushing for the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test", Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength". Lula countered, referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has been isolating itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a by-election at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by severe riots. Bolsonaro's supporters had stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court and the government headquarters in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is eerily reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden, who he said did not care much about international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening", Lula said. "It looks familiar to me", Biden replied, an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note to the press - Friday
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to accept them.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public sentiment was made against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society.
Now the Stuttgart newspaper, which usually follows Raudis in the subway or onanists in the park, is releasing a new edition with the friends of the "war criminal" Putin. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, it's that Mrs Wagenknecht is in first through fifth place, followed by Mrs Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who reads this paper anymore, and if they do, it's about time, because we've reached the familiar level where there's nothing below that.
And at the latest now, in a good dialectic, Mrs Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all those who are not yet completely stupid, that is to say, of peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people.
Harald Glööckler filed for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the Bild newspaper and RTL in the same words. He said: "I can confirm that my client has submitted an application to the competent court via his family lawyer to annul his life partnership. I do not comment on details".
Glööckler and his partner Schroth were together for 35 years, there were rumors of separation for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from the common house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports.
The last survivor of the Oradour-sur-Glane SS massacre has died
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins remained intact, a memorial centre was established in 1999. French President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. The survivor had worked for, among other things, Franco-German youth meetings.
A curve for 14 houses: in homeies everyone knows everyone
LZ-series Nordlippische Weiler: In homeien often live three, four generations under one roof. Here the inhabitants find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles roar a day along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some also return right away.
German central bank chief Christian Sewing believes that further interest rate hikes are "absolutely" necessary to combat high inflation. "Inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs could easily rise again, and the opening of China could also temporarily boost prices", Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag".
The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth consecutive time at the beginning of February and forecast a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16 March.
Higher interest rates raise the cost of borrowing, which can dampen demand and thus counteract high inflation rates, while higher borrowing rates can delay investment and thus weaken economic growth.
"The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher cost of financing for some countries", said Sewing. "Of course we have to keep an eye on this, but high debt levels must not deter the ECB from taking a firm stance".
The ECB's objective for the euro area is price stability at a rate of 2% over the medium term.This target has been far from being reached for months.While the upward pressure on prices eased again in January, consumer prices in the euro area of the 20 countries were still 8.5% above the level of the previous month.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, who can afford less for one euro.
If inflation remains high, private consumption "will collapse sooner or later", warned Sewing, who is also president of the German Bankers' Association (BdB). "That is what I see as the biggest danger to the German economy at the moment, but I am optimistic that we can avoid that scenario".
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "German pace" of infrastructure projects called for by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue. And it will perhaps be a bit more controversial", he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out, with which it will not necessarily have to go as fast as the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany-Tempo".
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters, but that should not automatically mean that we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a windmill in the neighbor's garden against his will", said Hartung.
In the past, the classic set of rules has been tried and failed. "We should think again whether the previous approach was correct. Perhaps we have overdo it with the set of rules and made it too complicated".
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of energy from renewable sources, such as solar panels, wind turbines, solar panels, solar water heating, solar water heating, and solar thermal systems.
Union warns of Bayer's demolition
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a possible break-up of the group after an announced change of management at Bayer. "From the point of view of the employees, Bayer with its three legs is exactly the right position for the challenges of the future", said Francesco Grioli, member of the union's executive board and Bayer's supervisory board, to the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
The report also highlights the need to improve the quality of life of the people who work in the pharmaceutical sector, the consumer health sector, the pharmaceutical sector, the pharmaceutical sector, the consumer health sector, the pharmaceutical sector, the non-prescription sector and the agricultural sector.
The background is the change of head of the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial head Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The former head of pharmacy of the Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been criticized. The 2018 completed acquisition of the US seed producer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars depends on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkuseners had brought expensive litigation about alleged cancer risks of the weedkiller glyphosate into the house. The Bayer stock was in decline for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the general meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking to extend his contract, which was originally scheduled to run until 2024.
The very small fund, with an unknown amount of stake in Bayer, is known for its aggressive approach. e divestment of "the Consumer Health business would be a possible way to increase the value of the company", Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the Rheinische Post.
Hundreds of thousands to protest pension reform
The Paris
The French are planning to take to the streets again on Saturday to protest against the planned pension reform.
The unions are protesting against the government's plans to take to the streets, with hundreds of thousands of people planning to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate again on Saturday against the planned pension reform of President Emmanuel Macron. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the plans of the center government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. More than a million people have already taken to the streets twice and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 people participated in protests. A turbulent debate in parliament has been going on for a week over the controversial reform.
Already many people in France are working longer than they would have to until the age of 62 if they had not paid in enough for a deduction-free pension when they reached the age limit.
Macron: Pension fund is in danger of running out
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, the employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order to keep the level of pensions stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
The government is not only seeking to reduce the retirement age, but also to speed up the increase in the minimum period of contributions for a full pension, which was decided on years ago, to abolish individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups, and to raise the minimum pension to about EUR 1200.
The pension reform is considered one of the most important projects of President Macron. A first attempt to implement the reform was canceled during the Corona pandemic, and there were massive protests and strikes even then. Several presidents before Macron had already tried to reform the French pension system with varying success - widespread protests and strikes were certain.
With Macron's camp no longer in absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of conservative Republicans who have announced support. But some of the deputies - even from Macron's faction - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote, Macron is currently worried about crippling strikes. Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility so that they would proceed calmly and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - sunny high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area over central Europe determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that sunshine is to be expected everywhere?
The Offenbach
"Looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately catches the eye directly over Central Europe", explains meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "Although this high will shift a little to the east over the next week, it will still determine the weather in Germany".
But calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "In fact, such a high can be quite nasty, leaving people in the lowlands with a gloomy, misty sky for days on end, while the high mountains are in the sunshine".
The weather is expected to be cloudy and foggy in most regions. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it may rain a little. Especially on the Alpine edge, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens during the day and the sun appears more and more frequently.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually getting stronger, again nibbles at the high mist and can dissolve it more and more as the day goes on", says the meteorologist. On the Alps, in the high plateaus of the Mittelgebirge and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sunshine is expected all day, while elsewhere it must first fight its way through the high mist. The highest values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine they are 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, they are expected to be only 3 degrees. In addition, weaker winds blow from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands, there may again be only a tough resolution of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather after fog resolution is clear. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, the sun shines all day according to the forecasts. The temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator hadert: No more world medal for Goggia
The top favourite, Sofia Goggia, was very disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
French
"I'm sad because I didn't do the best I could", the Italian told ZDF after she was knocked out by a goal.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill rider in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races in this discipline. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.
"I thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second", Goggia said after the surprise victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's life". Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal expected by all the experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not".
Missing girl in Berlin: who saw Viktoria?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Victoria Stankovych was last seen Friday at the Waidmannslust station, and police are asking for information on her whereabouts.
Berlin police are asking the public to help in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the school premises together with other children in the direction of the S-Bahn station Waidmannslust on 10 February 2023 at around 12.30 pm. She was last seen at the S-Bahn station. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of German language and place.
He is a very thin man.

Selensky and Ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kiev: With the demand to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
A joint teleconference was held to agree on a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Sports Ministry said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues", said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video conference was held at the initiative of the UK. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made the UK's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus cannot be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue".
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions", Selensky said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian aggressive war, in the end, even a neutral flag was drenched in blood and unwearable.
Ukraine threatens with boycott
Ukraine also considers Belarus a warring party because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selensky called on officials to work to protect Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being allowed to compete. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The conference was prompted by the announcement by the IOC that it would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in international competitions under certain conditions, and Ukraine's threat of a boycott if the IOC admits the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The German Ministry of the Interior, responsible for sports, then stated that it had also confirmed during the discussions that it would not accept the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to have the unconditional solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's effort to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way", a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior told dpa.
The German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January that "sports should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population.
The IOC is currently barring Russia and Belarus from many international sports competitions, but is seeking to allow athletes from both countries to return to the international sports arena under a neutral flag, provided they clearly adhere to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine.
Go where it happens
"Hey, hot ass!" whistling at the fool in the tight sexy costume and shouting obscene words: all this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind the term is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost: US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The Pentagon estimates that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, "half of the main stock".
The Russian army has already lost half its tanks in its aggressive war against Ukraine, according to estimates by the U.S. Department of Defense. "Probably half of the main tank stock" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine", said Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide further details on the number of tanks the U.S. estimates it has seized and destroyed at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger 2 battle tanks for March. Germany, in a coalition with other states, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The United States has also promised a battalion of 31 Abrams battle tanks. However, their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to catch up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin head Dmitry Medvedev offered to build and modernize thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad begged for planes, missiles, tanks", Medvedev, now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is a matter of course for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks".
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the European Parliament is given the opportunity to express its views on the draft resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and to make a statement on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
The army is in turmoil over the appointment of new staff
The post of the former director of the Military History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner was not advertised, but the Academy's personnel representative Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects corruption and abuse of office.
The Minister of the Interior, who is also the Minister of the Interior, has been appointed by the President of the Republic, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Interior, the Minister of the Interior, the Interior, the Interior, the President of the President, the President of the President, the President, the President, the President of the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the Prime Minister, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President,
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability for the content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision had the "appearance of a postman", says SPÖ spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos call on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still stuck up to its neck in the swamp of corruption", said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary request on the subject.
Carnival: First Fools to Kneel at the Cost
Thuringia's Carnival Town of Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional "fasching" move, unlike the state capital, but the higher costs, including security, are difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades are cancelled. The "Joyful People's Parade" in Cottbus, again the largest in East Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. Also during the Swabian-Alemannic Fast Night, no parades were canceled.
The carnival society's president, Heiko Claußen, says: "We are going through with our event", but here too financial worries are pressing: if more sponsors were not found or if the previous ones contributed even more, reserves would have to be tapped - "this is not possible every year".
And inflation: The price of sweets has sometimes risen by up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Nuremberg Fast Night Train Association. Due to luck in misfortune, 2020 was ordered too much, so there is still enough stock this time. For the move, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. For security, twice as many personnel are needed as in 2020.
The train is not going to be able to accommodate the large number of people who are travelling on the train. "I think that if it doesn't rain like a hailstorm on that day, we can expect an increased number of people", says Holger Kirsch, the train conductor from Cologne. "This is due to the fact that there has been no regular train for the past two years. Of course, there is no substitute for the train".
The Cologne Festival Committee did not comment on the cost in detail, but said that the train was generally "deficient", which was no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Self-Burned Vodka
The Ukrainians are not considered to be drinkable for nothing. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lemberg. Every now and then I discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't notice a big difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely available. They burn it here especially in the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. Exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics, no one knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a whopping 80 percent in five years. Well, you can hardly see here how you can believe the Russians. As a tourist, you should be careful with it. But that's only if it is sold in the masses there, then it will be fine.

Biathlon World Cup: President sees favourite win and praises the Supreme Court
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are greeted at the arena by the chandelier-maker Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal ceremony at the Oberhof World Cup sprint, but there were two glimmers of light in the fog.
As much as the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the podium on Saturday whether the windows on the shooting range really fell. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone", Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted smilingly, referring to the foggy clouds that kept coming into the stadium, which greatly affected the view of the race track for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof, got numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by the biathlon", he said and also praised Oberhof for its modernised sports facilities: "The renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions.
The Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again won the competition. Despite a penalty round after a shooting error, he secured the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his error-free shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round/39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian four-way victory perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and became twelfth (1:14.6).
Bo had entered the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visual conditions. However, in his last two standing shots he had the luck of the draw; they landed on the edge of the windows and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the victory together with his brother, who is five years older: "It is the best feeling to stand here with him", said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
"If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one", took sports director Felix Bitterling his "Lokomotive" in duty. The organizers expect for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 / ZDF and Eurosport live) a nearly sold-out arena.
Brych dislikes "Swarm of bees" in the square
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych is deciding on the referee ball.
The German referee wants to "punish consistently" unsportsmanlike conduct.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the interaction on the field of play. "I already think that there are new behaviors of the players, who after decisions surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area", said the 47-year-old to the German Press Agency. "We discussed this in the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it".
The German coach Christian Streich was given a red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich, there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "The coaching behavior also falls into the area of unsportsmanship. We have noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, that the behavior has become a bit demanding or aggressive towards referees. We also want to consistently address such unsportsmanship", said Brych.
DFB referee-chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good coexistence of coaches and impartial. "Overall, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. With this then the affected person has to live. This should not be anything world-moving", said Fröhlich of the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can lead to conflicts in the course of the game, but if it turns into a personal insult, then you have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee", said Fröhlich. In the most recent cases, the parties would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a process of rethinking were to be initiated in general, that such behavior simply is not appropriate", said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects at another level. "Of course, events from professional football always fade. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviour", said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and the affected parties, is always helpful".
Oftebro wins the combined event in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal bar and the ten-kilometer long ski run by Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter.
The German combined team will not compete in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing for the world championships, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia, with training in Oberstdorf. "We have three world-class athletes at home. The team feels it, of course", said German coach Hermann Weinbuch in ZDF.
Seven people injured in a road accident on the A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on the motorway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhine-Neckar district), including two children. According to a police statement, the accident occurred on Saturday when a motorist crashed into a car from behind during a slight backlog and pushed it onto two other cars. The complete blockage of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
The exhibition was initiated by the initiators Sebastian Freytag (L) and Georg Elben (R) and the artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, February 12, the Marler Sculpture Museum will close with an unusual exhibition, with some extras.
The final talk on the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarter of the Marler Sculpture Museum in Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over, the artworks disappear, but a catalogue documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum.
In addition, Dr Friederike Schuler will give a lecture on wall-painting in the service of the community, using numerous illustrations to present the peculiarities of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the links to this art genre in the Federal Republic, with a focus on NRW in the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and in 2013 she received her doctorate in mural painting of the Weimar Republic. Since then she has been researching building-based art as well as art and institution history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art on construction in NRW.
Arrest warrants for collapsed buildings in Turkey
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a decision on the conclusion of the agreement on the conclusion of the agreement on the association of the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community with the European Union.
Istanbul: Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible defect in the construction of buildings in southern Turkey after buildings collapsed during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, 33 people were arrested, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The defendants are allegedly responsible for defect in the construction that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible structural defects in collapsed buildings, Anadolu reported, and has issued 62 arrest warrants so far. One of the accused was reportedly arrested at Istanbul airport, where he tried to travel to Montenegro with cash, and is currently in custody, Anadolu reported.
A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck the Turkish-Syrian border area early Monday morning, followed by another 7.6 magnitude earthquake at noon, collapsing more than 7,500 buildings in Turkey alone.
The last Prime Minister of the GDR, Hans Modrow, has died.
Hans Modrow has died, the Bundestag's left-wing parliamentary group has announced. The 95-year-old died in the night of Saturday. Dietmar Bartsch, the group's chairman, praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95", the Left Party in the Bundestag announced on Saturday.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Wall, on 13 November 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days.
Left Party leader Dietmar Bartsch described Modrow in a message on the short-message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and militant socialist".
"He was an important adviser to our party until his old age, "whose wisdom will be lacking".
"The whole peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was a special merit of him. This will remain his political legacy", wrote Bartsch and Gysi in their obituary.
'His later activities in the People's Chamber, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing also that part of the former GDR population which was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated.'
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow had seen the new state "quite critically". Too quickly the German unity had been accomplished, the GDR had fallen too unconditionally, and too unilaterally it had been condemned as a "lawless state", Modrow had criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened last night
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy condemns Russian missile attacks, but Kiev is forced to repair the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks has forced repairs on Ukraine's energy grid, but Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, the head of energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television Friday evening. The situation with the power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to instability in the Ukrainian electricity grid, a reactor block at the Chmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production was cut at the Riwne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the Russian attack on Friday with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terrorism, but in a video message he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selensky doesn't want to abandon the small town of Bachmut
On February 24, the war will have been going on for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, an important Ukrainian supporter, just before the anniversary. The danger of Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, an air alarm was raised late Friday evening for the fifth time for this day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones", the military administration of the Kiev region said. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
German rail: Federal government selects network company consultants
The coalition agreement had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which should, however, be oriented towards the public good in the future.
The EU's budget is €80 billion.
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government to accompany this process. The repair congestion on the railway network is a major reason why the railway is currently very unpunctual. Minister of Transport Wissing has taken it upon himself to eliminate this problem by completely renovating entire railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations of the railway, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
The Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", the pulse did not come down even when entering. "Such a race", and that at the Home World Cup, "you can not describe it with words", she said. 11,000 spectators shouted to the thundering hit music with Germany flags, supervisors and team fell into their arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", she had decided
The pressure was particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old was the biggest, if not the only German medal hopeful outside the relay in the World Championship. Herrmann-Wick has won two World Cups this winter as the only German. In the overall World Cup, she currently ranks fifth. And even though the performance density among women in the top is much higher than among men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, there were others on the sheet for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Nicaraguan bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning head of state, accusing Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been tense since 2018, when protesters demanding Ortega's resignation took refuge in churches.
Bundeswehr: Defence industry calls for more orders from special funds
The first armaments projects have therefore already been cancelled, and other projects are threatened by the same thing as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. What investments would be specifically eliminated, however, cannot be said at the moment. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this stage", says a response from the Federal Government to a request from Bundestag member Ingo Gäensdech (CDU).
The background to the declining investment sum is the rising interest rate. The fully credit-financed special assets, which the Bundestag had decided in June 2022, must bear the interest charges for the loans themselves. If these increase, less money is available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation reduces the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Copper cell: accident with 3 injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive on the motorway upper Kupferzell left in the direction of Heilbronn on the motorway. At that time a 21-year-old VW driver was driving the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police announced.
Both parties to the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the accident site showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system did not result in any complaint. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The two cars suffered property damage totaling approximately 20,000 euros.
The Stuttgart Castle Square commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart residents responded to the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening.
The European Union is not only a political force, but also a political force, and it is a political force, and it is a political force.
The earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria is a matter of concern to the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people gathered in Stuttgart's Castle Square to remember and pray for the victims.
Many community members had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the prayer of the Imam seriously and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. He asked for health, protection from pests and for respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for help and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed to the following joint declaration on the situation in the Middle East: 'The European Union stands with the people of Turkey and Syria, and we stand with the people of Syria.'
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. The donation campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has been collecting donations in the street of the Bell for several days, to be transported by truck to the earthquake-stricken areas.
The following is a list of the most commonly used terms in the German language:
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps ".... The older people know the saying, the younger people simply put it into practice. In one way or another, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unprecedented renaissance. Because thanks to Home Office, those who do not sit in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now use the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or instead of a walk to the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 14 hours not only dogs are wandering around.
One reason could also be that modern people can combine the health-promoting fresh air with other things in the course of optimal time slot use. Why not take a short walk through nature to hear news from the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor? Or meet the friend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? Also, work and private life could be combined in this way - who says that the meeting with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? Unless there are no strangers nearby, of course.
Another thing that can be done well is to buy natural products. Fresh fruit, for example, that is on a table next to cheese on the side of the road. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid if you have not thought about the purchase in advance and made appropriate arrangements. So an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leave the farmer's wooden sales room with empty hands and regrets in their voice. "Sorry, we forgot the money".
The disappointment is palpable, since one has a wallet-carrying companion but no carrying case. This is also what one lets the friendly casual acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "That's not true! You do have a bag!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which one has quickly overturned before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the journey back with a meat-inlay and in that midday excursion you have not only been enriched by a lamb's back, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that on that day a second walk will be due - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and badly injured
The 25-year-old driver of the Audi was trapped in his car, and the firefighters freed him with a heavy device. The rescue service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Due to suspicion of driving misconduct, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, Audi suffered a death toll of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax returns: the end of the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has decided that the Treasury Department must turn over the former president's tax returns to Congress.
Trump 2018, when he was still President of the United States
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the department said in a decision Friday.
Contrary to political practices in the United States, real estate entrepreneur Trump did not make his tax returns public as a candidate or later as president. He fought against a release until the Supreme Court. A prosecutor in New York has now received the documents, but no details of it were allowed to be made public - unless it came to a trial.
The issue of the release to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: there the circle of those entitled to access is somewhat larger and under certain conditions individual details could be published in the course of the investigation of the committee.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law".Access to the Republican's tax records was a matter of national security, she tweeted. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president", Pelosi said.

British high-profile criminal caught in Thailand after long-running escape
London - A convicted British drug offender has been captured in Thailand after five years on the run. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "Most Wanted" list of most wanted criminals, the NCA said on Saturday, after he was arrested by Thai police in a Bangkok auto repair shop on Friday.
The leader of a criminal group had fled a trial in early 2018 in which he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempting to import eight million pounds (nine million euros) worth of amphetamines, according to authorities.

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the educated physicist from Unterfranken, who has lived in Vienna for three years and according to his own admission loves the Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits this. Whether this fits well into the generally prevailing domestic scientific scepticism here is up for debate. His humor fits very well to Vienna.
The English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, after all, he tried to establish himself as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what Knowledge Night actually is and what it can do - and what it can not do. Of course, there is also Corona, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put off: What's really important? All of this with a huge wink, unemotional and very ironic, and so you're not only entertained, but you're able to learn something along the way.

General
The single-player BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat action from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley plain there are rock pyramids and rock squares that offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shells.
The player is presented with slow moving chain vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended gameplay. In addition, UFOs still appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score through a UFO hit.
4. The game
The game progress is triggered when the START button is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds are audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game begins with slow moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles can be determined by the player by observing the text entered in the upper left corner of his cockpit's display.
The top cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to target on the screen. Furthermore, the opponent in the fire area is displayed in the upper left-hand display.
The UFOs are designed to circumvent the combat and distract the player, as they usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles. UFOs can be eliminated by both the player's tank and the enemy's tank. A shot through the player's tank will bring 5,000 points to this setting. If an opponent is hit, the following long points will be achieved: 1,000 points for a collapsing tank, 2,000 points for a missile and 3,000 points for a Super-Panzer. Super-Panzers can be switched and rotated twice as fast as a tank, or give the player the opportunity to unlock multiple bonus positions for the player, such as a long-range missile, or 3, 4 or 5 additional options for the player to unlock multiple tanks.
Initial input at peak results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of high scores, he or she may enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the game is over. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that with the triggering of a self-test, the resetting of the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or a power outage, the table of high scores is deleted.
New parts
The BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components. If you have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI switch lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing, which has made this structure unit more stable and ensures proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another change is the centrifugal rubber handle, which, like a centrifugal spring, always puts the control lever in the central position. The micro-controllers are now lightweight, so they can be replaced with a self-contained motherboard. The new device has been designed with a new energy-saving device called the BATTLEZONE. The XYZ console has been equipped with a screen that is connected to a larger screen, a larger screen, and a new C-Class console. This has been made possible by the addition of a new screen, a larger screen, a smaller screen, and a new screen that is connected to the same screen.
These new components, as well as all the other main components of this apparatus, are shown in Figure 1.
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should perform some checking to complete the quality control. To be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be performed: NOTE: The device has not yet been connected to the 220 V network. A. Inspect the outside of the housing for damage.
NOTE: Never force connections to the connectors. The connectors are provided with a force guide so that a correct connection is made. A 180 degree twisted connector will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check that the connectors to the game PC board are in place and in a correct position. (3) Check the device's serial number on the model plate on the back of the device. 3) Check that the stamped serial number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, Auxiliary PC board, Controller/Audio II PC board and the TV monitor. A diagram of the location of the serial number is on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be specified when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check that all other main components such as the network connector, the solar panel and the TV monitor are in place with a type plate on the back of the device.
The following are a series of tips that can help you solve most problems associated with current DirectX games.
Please take the time to check that your system meets the requirements listed on the package.The DirectX Diagnostic Program can be used to get an overview of your system if you are not sure that your PC meets the requirements.Please follow these steps to access the DirectX Diagnostic Program: Click the Start button and select the Run option.Enter dxdiag" in the text box.The DirectX Diagnostic Program user interface will now be displayed.Here you will have access to all relevant system details, including graphics and sound card information.You can check that the graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking the appropriate buttons in the DirectX Diagnostic Program, and then we will continue to test the DirectX Diagnostic Program by clicking on the DirectX Diagnostic Program's Start3 button and not changing the instructions.So, if you are not familiar with the DirectX Diagnostic Program, we will continue to test you via the DirectX Diagnostic Program.
It may happen that other programs take over the system resources needed for the game to run properly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are automatically started when the system starts. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "Background applications". In some cases, they can cause your program to hang or crash. Therefore, we recommend that you stop such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, look for the program's icon in the Windows taskbar.
Before installing software, you need to make sure that your hard drive is working at its best. So make it a habit to "clean up" your PC regularly. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Chances are that current games will run on your PC without much of a problem. A "clean" system also has the advantage of being much more efficient, and therefore other applications you use will run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help files to learn about the ScanDisk and Defragmentation and Data Cleanup tools.
Click the Start button and select the Help option (or Help and Support) to access Windows Help. 2. Now click the search box and enter the appropriate keyword, such as ScanDisk (Win 98/ME), Debugging (Win 2000/XP), Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup. You will then receive instructions on how to use these tools.
Is the game crashing or hanging?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the graphics card manufacturer. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:
How to stop all unnecessary background usage
Important note: After the game ends, you should reactivate the background applications by restarting your PC. This will automatically reactivate all the background applications you have terminated. Windows 98/ME
To exit a background application, click the entry in the taskbar and then click the exit button. Note: Do not exit the background applications Explorer and Systray, as they are required to run Windows. You can safely exit all other background applications. The window will now close and the task is finished. Repeat the above steps to exit all other background applications (up to Explorer and Systray on Windows 2000/XP Professional).
To exit a background application, go to the Applications tab, click the appropriate entry in the taskbar, and then click the End Task button". Note: Depending on your system settings, pressing STRG, ALT, and ENTF may not display the Windows Security window, but instead, immediately displays the Windows Task Manager on Windows XP Home.
To exit a background application, go to the "Applications" tab, click the appropriate entry in the taskbar, and then click the "Exit Task" button before calling the hotline.
If you want to make a call, please sit down at your PC and have the following information ready (see section 'Checking system configuration') and note materials ready. - PC make and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (memory) - Graphics and sound card and driver information
The following is a summary of the main points of the report.
I was inspired to develop video games by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new world of possibilities and seemed to me a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. It was a way for me to open up new horizons. I thought, as a pioneer of cinema at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I struggled with the immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything had yet to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and completely visual. To be honest, the next ten years of my life could not satisfy my creative hunger. I felt that video games could be a new means of expression, with which one could push the world to its limits. I was skeptical of the idea of a film that would have a tangible impact on our lives. I was also skeptical of the idea that we could have a completely different experience of the world, and that the ability to create a new game would have to be a fundamental tool for us to fight against the monsters that had been created by the previous generation, but I was also afraid to ask myself, and to answer the question that this is a very important question, because the lack of humanity, both the ability to create and the new, the ability to create, to be able to be both creative and to be creative.

Damage caused by transport
If external transport damage is detectable, it must be immediately reported, recorded on a transport document and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railway, etc.).
The device is set to the mains voltage indicated on the type plate. For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. According to VDE regulations, the device is equipped with a protective conductor connection and is intended only for dry rooms. The correct operation of the coinage system requires the correct positioning of the device.
IMPORTANT If at any time an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor, please turn off the machine briefly (pull the power plug) and then turn it on again.
Before repair, pull out the power plug! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch the parts that are conducting voltage! Even when the device is turned off, the monitor can still produce dangerous voltage. WARNING, HIGH VOLTAGE! At the anode connection of the image tube, there are about 20000 volts. Replace fuses only with those with the same values! A burned fuse signals overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced with a higher quality, serious damage can be caused. Replace components only with original replacement parts. Never printed circuits / connections when the device is turned on. SERVICE MANUAL Q
Game play
The game is set up so that a minimum prescribed area must be taken before the next area (round) can be attacked. At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are displayed by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. When alarms are triggered, SPARX SUPER-SPARX and aggressive. If you are trying to enter your area, your mark in your death sign will be blocked, you will not be able to reach the speed limit and will be able to destroy your own fuel fuel, and if you are over 4 seconds behind the speed limit, you will be able to destroy your own fuel and destroy the fuel.
The QIX game is able to test itself, provide data and demonstrate that circuits and controls are working properly. For more information see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted at the volume controller (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.
The following table shows the number of tests to be carried out on the vehicle:
Function: Switch to the next stroke
Programming and testing switch: TEST
Function: Switch to the next program step (display)
Programming and testing switch: up
Function: factory reset (until green), count by 1 step (when green is lit) Programming and testing Switch: Down
Function: counting down by one step
It is possible to install a coin counter in the device, a line to 412 V DC supply, a line to port J 15 - 13 on the ROM/IC board.
The following are the main types of service:
General: Programming and testing is done using the four switches, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board.
Programming display. This display selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) in which the address programming and the game will work. The languages can be set using the "Sub-Test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. Use programming. This display can determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, it can set a "maximum number of credits" that can be entered before the start of the game. The next move to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (green), the number of points to be won is set to the "Updated" value or "Sub-Test" indicator. The number of points to be won is set by pressing the "Updated" or "Sub-Test" indicator. The number of points to be won is set to 99 points. If the player is required to add up to a maximum number of points, the number of points can be determined by pressing the "Updated" or "Sub-Test" indicator.
'Throughput' means the percentage that must be reached to switch to the next throughput
'Time limit' means the release of additional Sparx
'Difficulty' means the degree of difficulty of the game
'Turn on tone': at "0" no tone when in standby mode
'Table model' for '1' sound, including standby mode (animation sound): for '0' standby mode
for "1" tableware
The values are used to set to highscores selected on the previous display (set to "back"). Pressing the "Up" button will set the initials to QIX Standard. Pressing the "Test" button will display the next program. Pressing the "Total Score" button will set the "Up" button to 0 minutes. The minutes recorded are: Total number of credits earned: Total number of credits paid. If the player's hit points and initials are not set to 0 points, including the next 10 point numbers, the values are used to set to highscores selected on the previous display (set to "back"). Pressing the "Up" button will set the initials to QIX Standard. Pressing the "Test" button will display the next program. Pressing the "Total Score" button will set the "Up" button to 0 minutes. The number of minutes recorded is: Total number of credits earned: Total number of credits earned in the free minutes. If the player does not reach 0 points, the total number of credits earned will be set to 0 points. The number of credits earned starts at 100 000 coins, the number of coins earned is given at 1,000 coins, the number of coins is given at the beginning of the game.
High Score (Hit Rate): Number of times a player has had a high enough hit rate to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" button, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Coin slot programming/normal coin setting This indicator allows the coin-maker to choose a standard coin setting or to program another setting
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches while the top digit is lit green on the screen. The size values change as the digit changes. If the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting that does not match the default setting is desired, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After one press, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that custom setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his minting values by selecting a setting that matches his minting values and only the values that are matched by the change of the digit. When the "Test" switch is reached, the setting is adopted. When the "Sub-Test" switch is pressed, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" button. The "Sub-Test" button indicates that the value of the coin has been reduced by one. The "MONY" button indicates that the minimum value of the coin has been reached. The "MONY" button indicates that the value of the "MON" is lower than the minimum value required. The "MONY" button indicates that the value of the "MON" is lower than the minimum value of the "MON" and can be reduced by pressing the "MON" button.
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This state probably indicates a failure or fault of the battery.
The following table shows the error rates for the different types of data:
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, pressing the "Test" switch will display the next program in each case. If a duration test of the video board is desired, the Self-Test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in the auto test mode. In this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is switched off. When the "Open Door to Coin Test" (money to check) indicator appears, the program must be removed from the video connector. This test can be performed as follows: 1 J - 19 J = 1 RAM / memory / memory = CMOS / J = 19 Hardware: This test can not be performed with a video connector protected (test results: CMOS / memory = X / memory / memory = J)
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced.
The Communications RAM test determines the operational reliability of memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking that the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the grid is holding with the display, a fault has been detected. If the communications RAM's fail during the video board test, the fault may have been caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or fault in the data board. To locate the fault, remove data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: Fault in U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
The video board is CMOS RAM.
After values have been entered into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are followed for correctness when reading back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is tested by inscribing a pattern on each side. The results of these entries are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis shows no RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next test will be started (data hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star number 1. The second one is that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable sewing defects. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was even greater. I had oriented myself on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it should sit so tight and I did not want to fight in an S or M with my upper.... In the end it would have fit from the length and from the hip... the rest I could swim. Besides, the lining material came to you already when you opened the package and spread everywhere. Just damage.
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket looks great. We were surprised by the good workmanship. It fits well on both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is absolutely delighted. She usually wears the 158, and you fit the 36 quite well in this case and will probably be worn next year as well. We can recommend an order.
High quality
I chose the rubber c because I always work with wood on the truck lift and that's not optimal. Unfortunately, I measured too much and the cladding doesn't fit quite. Which is my mistake. Then I slightly changed something to make it fit. The cladding looks very robust and you don't damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or the whole surface. It worked without problems. It doesn't slip anymore. I would buy again immediately.
Too big for a child under 1 year
The product itself is quite okay, but not less than a year old. Since the area to chew is much too large for the small mouth. We got it when our son was 7 months old and he could not use it for the size. Now at 12 months we have found him again and he can use it. He has not been able to bite anything with his already existing few teeth. And if he was in the refrigerator, it calms him down very much.
Quality not good enough / Unfortunately decreasing
I have been blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I would like to point out in advance that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. I have a very large one (for storing equipment) and a rather small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro backpack has now finally become too small and I need a replacement. I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (almost 29 EUR) on Prime Day and was actually very proud of this purchase, after reading many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came to me yesterday, I was very disappointed: the backpack is not bad for storing equipment, but I can't say that it is bad for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. And I also had to decide that the price of the backpack is very good for me. And I can't really say that the backpack is a good thing for me, but I can't really say that the price is too high for someone else. Unfortunately, the backpack is not as good as it seems, but the price is not as high as it should be. Unfortunately, the backpack is not as easy to buy, but the quality is not as it seems, but the price is too high for many people, so the backpack is not worth it is too expensive, but the price is too expensive, so the backpack is not worth it is too expensive, but the price is too expensive, but the price is too expensive, the product is too expensive, the price is too expensive, the price is too expensive, the price is too expensive, the price is too expensive, the too, the too, the too, the too, the too, the too, the too, the
Unfortunately, disappointed with the third part.
So far, I'd liked E.L. Todd's Electric series best, but my opinion was revised with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also recommendable and I was really looking forward to the third part. In the part the whole time is about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily dragged out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything and then with every argument is like a little child and gets involved?! At the same time there were inconsistencies, my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor and did not believe him when he said Taylor would stand up to him and try to convince the ex that Taylor could not do without him and save himself. But at the beginning of the third part Volt seems to have forgotten everything and I had to fight for Taylor and I hope that the last part of this series would come out at the same time. I think that Sarah also had to read the last part of the series.
Man destroys everything, appreciates nothing and does not learn! First of all: the film is not so bad now, as many write. Of course, the story is totally constructed, and conceived again and again according to the same scheme F. If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and does not appreciate anything, and does not learn! And that is exactly what the film wants to tell us! Often I thought during the film (and although I know that it is only a film, and the animals are from the computer): Oh God, the poor animals, they often shoot tears in your eyes. The film Of Jurassic World has therefore been made really neatly. It is only a pity that my film is not good for humanity and is not always a good message, although it is a consistent, but the last film was made for the environment, because we would have been the same, but according to the principles of Leprosy and arrogance and greed, the last one was made for the environment, and the planet.
A silent film with a sensitive feel.
Some people here expect a film à la 8 Mile. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is above all "French" - it is also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you engage with it and do not expect anything from it that it does not want to be.
Problems
It tastes like quench from the 90s, because of the orange, but that doesn't matter either. 5 days a package every morning: it didn't move, but absolutely nothing. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation the diarrhea has been for a week. It is worth noting that for the smaller pack size only 2 stars (unfortunately only seen too late) were given, for the larger one a full 5? This is very strange!
terrible smell and poor result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tinting to a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair dye remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed immediately that it smelled terrible! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out about a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it, as in the instructions, with no satisfactory result, again. This time it was a waste of time! It made no difference, my hair looked worse at the first attempt. What was the worst of all, after weeks of application it still darkened... I washed my hair often, just didn't change the smell.
Highly recommended
I've been taking the pills for a long time now and always take one pill every five days. My vitamin budget has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a long additional illness. So I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating healthy but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the pills. Absolutely recommended.
Function not quite flawless!!! After 3 months of using the battery case I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with time to "connect" with the mobile phone. This means that it does not charge anymore even if you press the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. If you remove the mobile phone from the case and reinstall it, you will solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this will create a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the mobile phone in the case, the cover is so worn that it detaches from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although this is not a lot of defects, but I find that with a case it works just for its battery function for over 3 months, and that is why I have disposed of the product for free, especially since I have used it for over 30€ of the cost.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews come about. After all, it's actually a spectacle towel, which you get in a slightly smaller form as a gift from every optician. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I promised myself much more of these towels. It's also really very thin. Since I've used it, I can't exchange it anymore. I'm disappointed and can't recommend it from my side. The price for these towels is far overstated. You shouldn't give more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker that I got as a promotional gift, unfortunately, broke. Basically, the onforu works great, is waterproof (my shcon fell in the shower), gives bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Socket must be watered, of course, otherwise it will dissolve... it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes... what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted into higher frequencies. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the frequency are almost hurting the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just good enough. My bass speaker has not been good enough to reproduce sound, but I have found that the bass frequency has been reduced, which is why I have to listen to the bass speaker quite often, but unfortunately I have not heard the bass speaker quite as well as I expected, so I have not really been able to reduce the sound in the onforum.
very bad
The paint was splintered in a few places and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint would come off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only exchange the damaged parts but like if both the dresser was damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon did all of this for us and sent us the money back. A LOB to Amazon
Better spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. The items are delivered, which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the mailman stuffed the product directly into my mailbox, a few templates were damaged. I did not fault it, because I urgently needed this product. The supplied glue hardly lasts, but sticks properly - like chewing gum, which does not become hard. Already a day after the glue almost half of the templates had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the glue material did not dry out (at least these 5 days after the glue was still not dry), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together. The templates are high in value and I would be happy to invest a little more money for the product and use it for a party.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closure + nice look + stable when built + shelf board can be positioned any way
- Doors pop by magnets (maybe rubber cups can compensate) - Some dirty spots
- the supplied dumbbells are much too small and wobbly (didn't have any others and didn't have them because there was no cup in the house, glued with DIY glue) - the supports for the inlay floor wobble a bit (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: if it didn't look so good and had such good measurements, I would give it fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Besides, I also find it a little too expensive for that.
I like the coffee, but...
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect I would have given 5* Unfortunately, the coffee does not flow evenly (if at all). Also the additional plastic waste (packaged separately see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and collects full score soon.
♪ I'm getting a little tired of it ♪
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds are terrible, and extremely loud. I couldn't make them any quieter either. Probably a defect, supposedly this was possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I fall out of bed immediately. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the walls with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. But then when it was time and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately to me. The bright colors and the color change I liked, unfortunately you can't turn the light colored. I also found it had a good battery so that the power went out at one time and the clock didn't go out, but the reason I called it back was because the time had to be changed.
Light is super, processing is insufficient
I replaced four lamps in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a frame - instead, a plate laughs at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "6 pay - 4 get" is not a good deal. Surely Amazon would have handled this coolly and quickly, but I only found out after the return deadline. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. However, it is not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for two stars. The light itself is superb. The rooms are now very bright and evenly lit. The light color is rather cold white. For the floor, work, my kitchen, etc. I would be perfect for evaluating living rooms personally to be warmer with the help of Durchaus Light. I can compare this to a good old 100 birch lamp and I can also try to answer all the other questions quickly, but I am happy to get a positive answer about this.
That's great.
I received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I thought long and hard about whether to order this set or not. ** The material is sturdy and it fits well in the hand. ** The utensils all have a hole in the handle to hang them. ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating. ** They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ° F. ** They do not transfer heat and can be touched directly. ** The dishwasher does, however, sometimes leave water stains on the black silicone. But after a short wipe, they are gone. Finally, I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-commodities sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping easy top. delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked faucet and tested all parts.We found that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we had to find significant scratches, abrasions. The screws / connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that even on the chrome faucet itself there are scratch marks / slicks. This part has probably been delivered and sent back. We keep this faucet and build it in the sink in the basement because there is one no matter how it looks. Unsuccessful; never order such goods again via Amazon but we prefer to give more in the original goods where we get it just so that customers will be scared to wear clothes!!!
The product itself is top notch, but the external sensor is broken after 6 months.
I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very simple, and the range of sensors is very good, there are no problems with the transmission from inside to outside. I also find the design of the device attractive. It is very simple and can be mounted on the wall or as a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be intact, plausible values are still shown here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably correct, because there are always completely astronomical values of the external humidity. It is a pity that the device was installed outside in one place and that is why I gave this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first delivery attempt was still running smoothly with Hermes across the Republic today, without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a good impression on me. The engine is strong and it gives a nice cut. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but okay. The big drawback is unfortunately the fishing basket. Firstly, it is only top and bottom of hard plastic and between them of fabric. If you fully disconnect it only for a short time, then it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. But very bad, that actually the practical filling level is half an inch already on the full catch basket. That is not so bad, yes, but it is not always so bad for the big cut, but if I have the design of the basket, it would be impossible to lose the big parts of the fish, so I have to go back to the design of the basket. So I have a solution: the design of the large fish basket is not always so good, but if I had to go back to the design of the large fish, I would have to the solution: the whole structure of the fish basket would be broken down.
Good equipment for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate via the app. Very good is the included plug-in sensor cable, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to save the battery are only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I give only 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be locked quite dimly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not connect again by itself, even if you put it in the router's nets. The batteries have to be removed and reconnected after a short break, then the battery should be disconnected again. - Actually, there is still a problem with the alarm.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY is a very good idea.
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear fastening screw is fully fitted, but the hotbed is still too high and the right front screw falls out, because it is not fitted at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The rods hold the car straight as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what to do, because it is impossible to print something. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very tiring. I have already written to support but after a week I still did not get a response. Sorry, I have no more hat. I am not expecting anything.
robust and precise I am positively surprised
My old measuring device has unfortunately died after many years, so I had to get a new one. This one looks very robust and is just as accurate after several test measurements. It comes with two batteries, so it can be started immediately. The packaging of the device is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the device does not leave any wishes open and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it full marks and I think it will last at least as long as the old measuring device. From now on there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
The disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and for the time being I haven't worn it because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, that smell hasn't gone away, even though it was constantly "ventilated". Since it's no longer possible to return it, I discarded it. Discount from purchase
For the price, okay.
The stars and spheres on this chain are a little too big for me personally, so it seems quite solid. The larger spheres are free to move, which I find quite nice. However, the chain as a whole is very easy to handle, so I've already ripped the cap off twice. So far I've been able to repair it again and again, but I don't think it will last long. But for the low price, you simply can't expect anything really high-quality.
A very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple lock actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't open, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, which makes it a little softer and more pliable. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the lock is made of steel!
Unfortunately, I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I felt that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now for the function: connect only after some trickery.... you follow the instructions it does not work at all, only after I had removed a battery from the base station again and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, and that although the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, this was not so useful for me! Thing returned! Would recommend against any purchase, in any case, only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner shaft had rusted. I bought it again for one reason only, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew that the connections of the suction pipe and the drain would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and the current pump will perform its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slide was broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump in the future a little better than using only a thin-walled carton. I kept the pump, as described above, despite the fact that I urgently needed the pump and the rust in the pump did not affect the performance of the pump.
I could have thought about it better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought that an organizer like this is more pleasant than running around with a huge keychain all the time. At first everything went quite well. However, then the paint ran off quite quickly and the screws had to be pulled back. It's nice that this can be done with a penny, but also with a penny. I have not found a suitable slit-screw-drawer that would not have immediately ruined the whole screw. Now to get to the most important part of the whole thing: the attachment of the key. The nice thing is that you can put the screw through the different parts, the screw in different sizes or lengths, but then you should have screwed the whole thing, but then you can buy a whole piece to bring the whole thing together again. This is a complex assembly, but then you can only use it for the price, and then you can never buy the screw again. Finally, the third thing is to balance the entire winding and the whole thing.
Not entirely conform to the dimensions indicated
Lightweight zippers, the material looks sturdy and all in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually assess the product after the first use. In advance I can already say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can not really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really large parts can be directly in the suitcase - as before. It is also worth noting that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, since the round cosmetic bag still contained two smaller bags / bags. Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention this. However, the fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color tone and is made of other material, the bags do not bother me personally. I do not see the price-performance ratio as an example.
So there.
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas, but now when I wanted to use it again, it didn't. Battery? Replaced. But it still doesn't work. So I could have just tossed the money in the trash.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. An improvement in the sound I could not hear on my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. With them were two black cables. The battery life is very long. Definitely perfect sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The earmuffs are totally soft and comfortable to wear. Also the weight is kept very low. Recommendation to buy in this price range.
A dress of elegance
Very nice dress, which is well worn for all occasions.. price-performance is completely consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the flash sale. It fits my size perfectly, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the cut wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could also handle a little more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Finger off. It can't get any worse. I really and truly didn't expect such a piece of junk to be sold nowadays. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It is assumed that the USB ports provide enough power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually runs, Blu-rays are detected with maximum unreliability. The discs have to be inserted multiple times, after which it makes clanging noises like you haven't heard since the 90s old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes you can either restart the computer because nothing is detected or the disc is finally detected. But then you must not press any button or jump to a chapter during the pause or change the sound of the film. If you buy this DVD or any other software that doesn't come with a Blu-ray, it will of course cost you nothing.
It does what it's supposed to do, but it's not pretty. First of all, I want to point out that the two USB ports are actually a blink of an eye, because only the port that points up is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging some devices there and therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and had I only needed a slight extension, I would certainly not have bought this shapeless lump with gold plugs. But apart from the looks and my miscalculation, the extension performs its service very reliably. And by the weight of the plug, the plugged USB stick doesn't move around as easily as it would with a normal extension. So no real miscalculation, but my ears are ringing.
I bought this product so I can connect an audio output and a display to the iPad (Pro). With iOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters I had to send back could not do this, unfortunately. Practically, the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is no problem. Audio is delivered via HDMI. What I use my PlayStation P for: There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also a magnetic support. My case does not fit the adapter. Well, it also keeps in contact and therefore is safe... Everything, however, is very expensive because it fits in the middle of all the wireless devices. Aluminum performance is still very justified in a small price.
Any quantity of power
It's a great device. It's been running for months without any problems. It's not light or quiet, but it's quite powerful. I find the temperature setting a bit too cool, so I'm always on level two. It's also fallen on the tile floor several times and survived it well. And I like the simple design too. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good.
The workmanship of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with a weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and we are positively surprised that in live mode the location is felt to be 0.5m accurate. In offline mode if the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters, which is not a problem. I would buy it again anytime. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently it lasts about 1.5 days. Here would be a super solution that would last 7-14 days. Although there is an XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, so the battery would not last with us and we also find it inconvenient to change it daily. You should not deal with the dog with his collar.:-)  The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks, garbage.
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the life span is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in gym class, after a few weeks the sole breaks and the shoes can no longer be used. The last pair was also in normal use, so they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the class. Unfortunately it was not so. The shoes are more expensive garbage and absolutely not to be recommended.
Perfect fit - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after five years, so I was happy to order new ones. These, unfortunately, are poorly made at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but at second glance, you can see that the edges are poorly made and the retainer on the heel is quite loose and very likely will not last five years like mine before. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it for good luck. The mattress and an air pump were included in the package. As for the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for testing. I noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it will not reappear. In the pumped state, a direct delivery test was carried out. It can be placed on it well and fits super well to the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace the hard bed, but for the days of the event itself it is of pure luxury. Since the mattress fits wonderfully in my car. The mattress is perfectly suited to the back seat. Before we have the pumps, we have to put the adapters out. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it does not reappear again. In the pumped state, a direct delivery test was carried out. It can be put on it. Of course, this mattress cannot replace the hard bed, but for the days of the event it is of pure luxury. Since the mattress fits wonderfully into my car.

Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately the calendar gets only two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately the calendar is torn open by the lip processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly because they almost pleased him. The parts often come out wrong which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to put the parts on. After the car is completely assembled during the game, parts fall off. (Most of the front decoration. This can also be very badly attached again.) I would not buy this calendar anymore and would not recommend it to anyone. Eventually the manufacturer of the calendar made it better for the next edition.
a real drone
I'm very excited about the drone. My seven-year-old daughter flies it. Inside it flies very well and the five minutes of flight time are usually quite enough. The fact that hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks down very quickly I did not expect anything different with the price, but falls from the ceiling to the ground, whether it is tiles or carpet, are no problem. If there are questions of nice contact.
ok but only with compulsion to Steam playable. Did not see when buying that it is not a game CD but merely a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is a shame. Since then the computer is constantly hanging, which would not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails on the battery life.
I was looking forward to the watch. Design and appearance great, news etc were easily displayed. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. There are big hooks: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, overnight only on the drm cabinet and in the morning 11% less battery if not used. Came a day many messages, the battery was already at noon / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time. Therefore, for me not useful. Very sorry.
Noble Envelope with Restrictions
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10 +, you should definitely get a cover. I recently liked covers in which you can also insert the credit card. This is what the cover here offers. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the cover is a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather cover makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks noble. The phone is unlike many other covers around, only at the connectors are gaps. Otherwise, you can easily operate the single-board and silencer on the sides through the cover. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge on QI devices, even through the thickness of the cover. You can charge the phone well from the cover. The leather cover is not as well processed and can only be properly charged on the Galaxy S4 - like the QI LORS - if the earphone is not properly charged.
a high-quality casing with a glass-reinforced film
Rugged case with a real armored glass as a protection for the screen in a classic design offers a round protection for the whole iPhone 11. fits very well and can also be easily lifted. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not pollute. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and is firmly attached to the phone. Overall a good purchase.
