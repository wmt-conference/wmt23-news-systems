4.1 Overview
The characters in this file are encoded in single-byte, double-byte, or four-byte encoding.
The single-byte part includes all 128 characters from 0x00 to 0x7F of GB/T 11383-1989.
4.3 Double-byte section
The double-byte part includes all the graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, the CJK Unified Ideographs in GB/T 13000, and some graphic characters.
The characters in the double-byte part are arranged according to Appendix A.
The graphics, code positions, and functions of the ideographic character descriptors should comply with the provisions of Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 provides a unified encoding for Chinese characters used in China, Japan, the UK, Vietnam and other countries and regions.
Chinese characters with unique abstract glyphs are assigned individual code positions; Chinese characters with the same abstract glyphs but different origins are assigned shared code positions.
Encoded Chinese characters are referred to as CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-byte section
The four-byte section includes 66 CJK Unified Ideographs (9FA6 to 9FEF, excluding 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB) from GB/T 13000 beyond the aforementioned double-byte characters, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F, and characters of minority languages already encoded in GB/T 13000.
The four-byte part of the character is according to Appendix C.
5 Overall Structure
In the main text, numbers preceded by 0x are in hexadecimal, and those not preceded by 0x are in decimal.
In the appendix, all coded representations are in hexadecimal, while all other numbers are represented in decimal.
The single-byte part adopts the coding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using the code positions 0x00~0x7F.
The double-byte portion uses two eight-bit binary bit strings to represent a character, with the first byte code ranging from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the tail byte code being 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte part uses the unused 0x30 - 0x39 from GB/T 11383 - 1989 as a suffix for the extension of the double-byte encoding, with the encoding range being 0x81308130 - 0xFE39FE39.
The encoding range for the first byte of a four-byte character is 0x81 to 0xFE; the second byte is 0x30 to 0x39; the third byte is 0x81 to 0xFE; the fourth byte is 0x30 to 0x39. That is: 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239; 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; and 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.

The content of this manual page is excerpted from the full documentation of the GNU C compiler, and is limited to explaining the meaning of options.
Unless voluntarily maintained, EURo files, Info files are authoritative documents.
If a discrepancy is found between the manual page and the software, please check the Info.
If we find that the content of this manual page is causing significant confusion and complaints due to being outdated, we will stop publishing it. There is no other choice, like updating the Info file and the man manual at the same time, because other maintenance work on Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this. The GNU project considers the man manual to be an outdated product and time should be spent elsewhere.
For complete and up-to-date documentation, please refer to the Info file `gee' or the Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) manual. Both are derived from the Texinfo source file gee.texinfo.
The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.
The extension of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the extension controls the default settings.
GCC considers preprocessed files (.i) as C files, and sets up C-style linking.
g++ considers preprocessed files (.i) as C++ files and sets up connections in C++ format.
The extension of the source file indicates the type of language and subsequent operations.
.c C source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembly.
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembly.
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembly.
. CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembly.
.m Objective-C source program; pre-processing, compiling, assembly.
.i is a preprocessed C file; compilation, assembly.
.ii is a preprocessed C++ file; compilation, assembly.
.s assembly language source program; assembly.
Assembly language source program; preprocessing, assembly.
.h preprocessor files; these usually do not appear on the command line, other files with subsequent names are passed to the linker. This typically includes:
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Linking is always the final step unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used, or a compilation error prevents the process from completing.
During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable filenames (including specified .o H label files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order they appear in the command line.
Options must be given separately: 'de' is entirely different from '-d -r'.
Most `-E' and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly specify the language of the input file as language (rather than the default choice obtained from the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option is encountered. The language is optional.
Close any explicit language specification, therefore process the files behind based on the file name suffix RE AS E `-x' option.
If only a part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking) is operated, you can use the `-x' option (or the file name after Ah) to tell geo where to start, and use the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' options to tell geo where to end. Note that some option combinations (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces the source file name with `.o' and `.ec' file names. You can use the -o option to choose other names. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option -S F what's going on.
The target file.
After compilation, it stops and does not proceed to assembly.
During the compilation process, pipelines are used instead of temporary files, as the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipelines. This is not a problem for GNU's assembler, which can accept a C "dialect" that supports ANSI standard C programs.
This will close some features in GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as rarely used ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, and despite the use of all standard libraries available in the hosted environment (note: in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. In the corresponding freestanding environment, there is no standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website).
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', it is handled in the C style - that is, it does not specify the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameters are empty.
The list of sections was deleted here in an attempt to support certain aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual, we have already deleted the details, so people won't HERI when the content becomes outdated.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing assignment to 'this'.
The result is the same as with the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support certain aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
Especially the content mentioned above about the preprocessor, but does not include the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
The -fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the '$' character in identifiers (only for C++).
You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the `$' symbol.
(GNU C++ allows the '$' symbol by default on some target systems, but not all.)
The -fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from ant type to enumeration type (MEF c++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-templates produces smaller code for template declarations (only in C++), by generating a single copy only at the place where each template function is defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation' (definition) or `#pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.
When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instantiations are of external type. You must ensure that the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved through typedef, which references each required instance.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-external-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set as built-in.
All member functions (except for constructors and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.
This does not imply that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; when this happens, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the types of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression to not match.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows assignment to this (only for c++).
After integrating the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++, the assignable 'this' seemed out of place.
Therefore, by default, assigning a value to 'this' within a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation valid through the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
The -funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, similar to unsigned char.
Different machines have their default char type. It could be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when dependent on the symbolic nature of data, a portable program should always use either signed char or unsigned char.
However, many programs have been written to use only simple char, and expect it to be a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine for which the program is written).
This option, and its opposite, make such programs work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If no explicit 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier is stated, these options are used to define signed bitfields or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bit fields are signed, as they inherit from basic integer types such as int, which are signed. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in the writable data segment, without any special treatment.
This is for compatibility with some old programs that thought modifying string constants was a very bad idea; the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The impact of COVID-19 on the drug market.
Its impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, this disease has overwhelmed healthcare services to the point of near collapse, and the restrictive measures implemented by governments have caused serious disruption in the global economy.
The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is still unclear and difficult to predict, but it could potentially have far-reaching effects.
Some producers may be forced to find new methods of manufacturing drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit the acquisition of precursors and basic chemicals.
Smugglers, unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.
The changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented, but there are still some lessons to be learned from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to seek cheaper synthetic substances, shifting their usage patterns towards injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments around the world have cut budgets related to drugs.
If governments around the world respond to the current economic recession in the same way, preventative measures and treatment services for drug use and related risky behaviors could be severely impacted.
Additionally, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may decrease, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Some countries, where a large amount of drugs are smuggled via commercial flights, are expected to be most directly affected by drug trafficking activities.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their personal backpacks or hidden in their private luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger transport almost everywhere, activities supplying drugs through commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.
Despite disruptions to the international postal supply chain, activities involving trafficking through the dark web and cargo mail may increase.
In the long run, economic recession and related lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment rates and lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable are more likely to resort to harmful drug use, develop drug-related diseases, and turn to illegal activities related to drugs, whether it's production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation, providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to strengthen their ranks.
With the decline in government response capabilities, these changes may quickly take root, becoming the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market Growth
The pattern of population growth partly explains the reason for market expansion.
Drug use around the world has been steadily increasing, both in terms of total numbers and the proportion of drug users in the global population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 2.1 billion drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, and in 2018, it was estimated that there were 2.69 billion drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population group.
Over the past twenty years, the rate of drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This reflects to some extent the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Teenagers and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while in developed countries it decreased by 10%.
Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug markets.
Whether in developed or developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural ones.
Part of the overall increase in drug use is due to the large-scale migration of people from rural to urban areas. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization could be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where the trend towards urbanization is more pronounced.
Wealth increase is associated with a rise in drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest people worldwide, with drug use being more common in developed countries than in developing ones.
Drugs like cocaine are even more strongly associated with wealthier regions of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the affluent social classes.
However, the rate of transition to drug addiction is higher among people with lower socio-economic status.
Data from a few countries suggest that harmful drug use patterns and morbidity are associated with low income.
These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier social classes.
The global economic constraints caused by the COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have historically been associated with an increase in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide to become unemployed.
The COVID-19 pandemic could potentially lead to an expansion of the drug market, as more farmers may increase or engage in illegal crop cultivation, either due to reduced control by national authorities or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of an economic crisis.
COVID-19 related restrictions have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, potentially increasing maritime trafficking due to its lower interception risk and higher smuggling quantities compared to air or land routes.
Recently, there have been reports of cocaine shipments being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity increased.
The presence of non-internationally controlled substances remains stable, but new types of potentially harmful opiates are increasing, making the drug market increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.
About 500 new active substances are introduced to the domestic markets of member countries each year.
Currently, the majority are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opiate-like substances.
While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
In 2014, the total number of new psychoactive substances identified included only 2% that were opioid-like, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in the class of opioids are analogues of fentanyl, whose efficacy and harm have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America and other regions, albeit to a lesser extent.
In North America, fentanyl is used both as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and to manufacture counterfeit medicinal opioids.
Some evidence suggests that the phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive stimulants also exists in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce a stimulant effect.
The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly established among vulnerable groups.
A single new type of psychoactive substance has almost never formed a large market.
However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
Regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate. Many chemicals commonly used as precursors for the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives, not only substances with looser controls, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade regulation, the so-called "designer precursors."
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: reports indicate that a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia in March 2020 led to a rise in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market changes in the blink of an eye.
Synthetic drugs have replaced opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation.
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The amount of opium intercepted by the Russian Federation authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opiate use has significantly decreased.
However, the stimulant market seems to be growing increasingly vibrant.
Evidence suggests that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methcathinone and alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now ubiquitous in the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported a sharp increase in the number of secret processing sites for the production of various illegal drugs recently seized, more than doubling in two years, rising to 152 sites in 2018.
Growth in the methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq.
As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison, and other institutional staff had already revealed the significance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to Phentermine and Tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that marijuana was harder to obtain than "fentanyl" or methamphetamine.
Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing sites, and the DEA has expressed concern over the large-scale importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors at these methamphetamine processing sites.
In Afghanistan, the production of methamphetamine appears to have begun in 2014.
Since then, the seizure of methamphetamine has been steadily increasing.
However, the amount seized in the first half of 2019 was 657 kilograms - a sharp increase compared to the previous year.
Large amounts of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, indicating that the country's production is rapidly increasing.
Policy changes and trends.
Jurisdictions where the non-medical use of cannabis has been legalized tend to see an increase in cannabis use.
Canada, Uruguay, and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most jurisdictions where marijuana use has been legalized, there has been an increase in use, although the same trend has been observed in jurisdictions where non-medical use of marijuana has not been legalized.
In the two earliest states to legalize it, Colorado and Washington, adult non-medical use of marijuana has increased, particularly in the past month and daily or nearly daily use, exceeding the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that since 2011, the use of marijuana in Uruguay has increased, with last month's usage almost doubling.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and regular use of marijuana.
Short-term data from Canada also indicates that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is the reason behind the global plummet in cannabis seizures the legalization of marijuana?
In 2018, the global seizure of cannabis herb fell to its lowest level in 20 years, due to a decrease in seizures in North America, which had fallen by 84% over the past decade.
In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world during the same period almost doubled. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect, but the effectiveness of domestic regulation of these substances is still difficult to assess.
Countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use for these substances.
In some other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following domestic legislation.
Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets. Medicinal opioids used for pain management and palliative care are primarily provided in high-income countries, with uneven distribution across regions.
In 2018, over 90% of all medically consumable opiates were in high-income countries.
Approximately 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for approximately 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low and middle-income countries makes up 88% of the global population, but consumes less than 10% of medicinal opiates.
The barriers to accessing medicinal opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescription practices.
The risk of drug addiction is greater among the poorer population, with approximately 35.6 million people suffering from drug addiction in 2018.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by studies in high-income countries, where individuals' adverse socio-economic trajectories - not just their status at a particular point in time - are associated with the risk of drug addiction.
Drug addiction can also exacerbate socio-economic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be associated with stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, diverse sexual orientation groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug-related diseases, or encounter problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) index, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the wider societal impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past decade.
Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17%.
Among injection drug users, the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with untreated hepatitis C leading to liver cancer is particularly high, reaching up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited global data suggests that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.
But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs.
While drug use may lead to criminal behavior, in some cases this link can be partly attributed to various mediating factors such as socio-economic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is already a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, could potentially be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depend less on the amount of trafficking and more on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.
Latest trends.
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, while opioids pose the greatest harm.
It is estimated that in 2018, 192 million people used cannabis, making it the most widely used drug in the world.
In contrast, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the associated risks of opioid drugs are often overlooked due to the smaller number of users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug use, 50% were caused by these substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Tramadol; in North America, it is Fentanyl. These two regions have almost no commonalities in terms of economy, demographic data, or general drug use patterns, but both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.
Part of the reason fentanyl causes overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, there has been a significant increase in the non-medical use of Tramadol market.
In this region, the number of patients using Tramadol for treatment is increasing.
In 2017, the global interception of tramadol significantly increased, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating turmeric, the global seizure amount dropped to 32 tons.
The crises in these two places were brought about by the simplicity of manufacture and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation on carfentanil and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
What exacerbates the crisis in these two places is that these substances are supplied in both the pharmaceutical market and the illegal market, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.
The use of stimulants is continually increasing.
In the field of stimulants, cocaine and methamphetamine are dominant, with the usage of both substances on the rise in their main markets.
In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it was quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, about 27 million people used amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, such that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, and sometimes both increase and decrease to meet the same market demand.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk for intravenous drug users.
It is estimated that in 2018, there were about 11.3 million people who injected drugs, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.
Over one million injection drug users are infected with the HIV virus, and 5.5 million suffer from Hepatitis C.
In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug use, half of which were due to liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most of the hepatitis C in injection drug users remained untreated.
The restrictions due to COVID-19 may cause a shortage of opioids, leading users to substitute with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injection or inject more frequently, more harmful methods of use may emerge.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU official: reception process bottlenecked - China News Network.
EU summit argues incessantly over refugee policy, EU official: every step of the reception process has bottlenecks.
According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU leaders agreed to implement stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to deport illegal immigrants, reported by Niu Ruifei, the special correspondent in Belgium for Global Times.
The move by the EU was reportedly a response to the growing concern over illegal immigration in Europe, with the core issue now being that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported.
According to summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilise substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and its member states have been constantly arguing over issues such as the payment of fence costs.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the related costs.
However, diplomats from some member countries said that if Europe could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
The European website Euractiv reported that EU officials admitted that there were bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, and the limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities of member states could not prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries, leaving the EU's refugee reception system in a near "permanent crisis".
According to estimates by the European Commission, Schengen countries in the EU received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded over 330,000 instances of illegal entry last year.
In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants based on the court decision of another member state.
Additionally, it was reported that EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of safe countries," paving the way for the EU to compile a common list.

The US escalates "chip war" severely damaging the global semiconductor industry - China News Network.
Recently, the US "chip war" against China has shown signs of escalating - first, under US pressure, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then foreign media reported that the US government is considering severing all ties between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order restricting US investment in China's sensitive technology industries... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US has been relentless in its efforts to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never ceased its efforts to curb China's development in the "core" sector, precisely suppressing the semiconductor supply chain to China on one hand, and constructing a "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain alliance on the other, aiming to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it's courting South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or establishing a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or establishing a semiconductor industry "small circle" through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework", the United States is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the US by introducing politicized, camp-based, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, in order to make up for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintain its advantageous position in the global chip industry.
However, the US's high-profile "chip tactics" against China also resulted in a "lose-lose" situation.
Recently, the well-known American chip manufacturing equipment supplier, Lam Research Group, announced that due to the impact of the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off another 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography giant, ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in semiconductor prices.
US media analysis shows that after the US government's aggressive suppression of China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have been severely affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The so-called US suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has already been formed.
According to professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross national borders more than 70 times, taking up to 100 days in total.
Despite a strong foundation in the semiconductor industry, the United States is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced process technology, and heavily relies on the East Asia region.
Even though the United States is making great efforts to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain towards a regional development dominated by a "small circle" of the US, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are hard to change.
The United States' aggressive "reshaping" and "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain has severely impacted the global semiconductor industry.
The chip is at the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the "Innovation and Competition Act", the "2022 American Competitiveness Act", and the "Chips and Science Act", using technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership; it has both rewarded and threatened allies, enticing chip manufacturers such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the US, striving to ensure America's global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the United States has indeed caused trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, reaping real benefits.
But in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the United States has forced the Chinese chip industry to continuously break through, causing it to lose a huge Chinese market, which will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies, and harm the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products go on sale, with a minimum holding period of 360 days - China News Network.
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products goes on sale.
Seven products from the home institution are available, with the shortest holding period being 360 days.
Personal pension financial products have finally been launched.
On February 10th, China's Wealth Management Network released the first batch of personal pension wealth management product list, and seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, ABC Wealth Management, and Postal Savings Bank of China officially went on sale.
At this point, the "shelf" of personal pension accounts finally gathered four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management, personal pension insurance, and public pension funds.
According to the introduction, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all publicly raised net value open-ended products, including 5 new products and 2 existing products. Except for one mixed product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income products.
A Beijing Youth Daily reporter noted that of the five newly launched products, four came from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which were fixed income products. The shortest holding periods were 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, with corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) of 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, and 5.25% - 5.75% respectively.
The remaining new product is "Postal Savings Bank Wealth Tianyi·Hongjin with a minimum holding of 1095 days No. 1", which is also a fixed income product. The fundraising began on February 10 and ended on February 19, with a risk level of two.
Of the two surviving products, one is the Agricultural Bank of China's "Agricultural Bank of China Sincere · Dynamic" 360-day technology innovation RMB wealth management product, with a mixed investment nature and a risk level of three.
Another surviving product is "Post Bank Wealth Tianyi·Hongjin with a minimum holding of 365 days No. 1", a fixed income type, which began fundraising on December 30 last year, officially operated on January 4 this year, and the accumulated net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the State Council Office on Promoting the Development of Individual Pension Funds," financial products that can be invested in by individual pension fund accounts include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and public funds.
The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marked that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
The regulations stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products, and other personal pension products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Taxation Administration issued a notice, clearly stating that the individual pension system would be implemented in Beijing, Tianjin, as well as 36 pilot cities and regions including Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Xiong'an New Area, and Jincheng City in Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, the number of participants in the personal pension scheme was 19.54 million, with 6.13 million contributors, and the total contribution amount was 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks involved in the pilot only launched three types of products: personal retirement savings, personal pension insurance products, and public pension funds.
Now that personal pension financial products have gathered, how should investors choose?
Experts from the BOCOM Wealth Management Product Development Department stated that compared to other personal pension products, the pilot phase of pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products both have three characteristics.
The first is robustness, with a more sound risk management mechanism, more stable investment strategies and concepts, and the implementation of independent third-party custody outside of the parent bank.
The second is long-term, the term of pension financial products in the pilot stage are all 5 years and above, the personal pension financial products to be issued in the next step have a minimum holding period of 1 year in principle, and holding for more than 3 years is encouraged.
Thirdly, it is inclusive, with a low threshold for product purchase, generally starting at 1 yuan, and some as low as 0.01 yuan, with more favorable rates for product custody fees, management fees, and other charges.
Professionals point out that investors should make choices based on the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long-term, high interest rates, and high security, suitable for people with low risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection, more suitable for those who cannot bear investment risk and can accept stable returns; while personal pension financial products and public fund products do not guarantee principal or returns, have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are higher, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should overcome the trust crisis - China News Network.
Another major gym "going bust"?
Recently, the issue of member rights protection at the well-known fitness organization, Zhongjian Fitness, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the institution's bankruptcy and absconding caused panic among the members, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the person in charge of the agency responded, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the controversy was settled.
Why is it that when individual fitness institutions temporarily close some of their branches due to operational issues, instead of calmly waiting for the problem to be resolved, many members' first reaction is "something is seriously wrong"?
Behind the controversy over gym club membership rights, there is a deeper issue of trust crisis in the industry.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and "earning money from non-attending users" is the underlying logic of their development.
By obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores, it seems like a cycle that can be repeated. However, it's actually robbing Peter to pay Paul, and cannot form a stable profit model.
Negative news such as gym closures are frequently reported in the industry, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From a market perspective, a gym can certainly be considered a good business with a "money-making" future.
Despite its ups and downs, the fitness track has always attracted capital attention.
Multiple data show that the popularity in areas such as cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, indicating a sustained market recovery.
Specifically in the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the deepening of the concept of healthy living, there is great potential for the development of the fitness industry.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, just emerging from the crisis, they are blowing the horn of pioneering and expanding, pouring all their financing funds into the construction of new stores.
Undeniably, in recent years, due to the impact of the pandemic, many institutions have withdrawn, and the industry has reshuffled. Strong companies are selectively increasing their acquisition efforts and repositioning, which may present new opportunities.
However, if the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a steady and long-term path, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.
Only by being steady and reliable, and re-establishing consumer trust and security, can we truly win the market and the future.
Compared to aggressively expanding with new stores, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to focus on improving services and retaining customers through high-quality development.
Firstly, retaining users relies on providing good service.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to a "user-oriented" approach, focusing closely on user needs and placing the emphasis on improving and upgrading services.
Secondly, digital transformation is needed to enhance the user experience.
For example, the currently popular internet gym model allows users to pay per use and choose their own location.
At the same time, physical data and exercise data can be effectively utilized, and social needs can be met, achieving a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without personal trainer sales pitches and expensive annual memberships, users' concerns about fitness institutions "running away" are reduced, thus increasing trust.
Additionally, there is a need to actively explore diverse business formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from single service to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become new consumption entrances. Peripheral products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment needed for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

Buy at a higher price, get a refund for the difference!
"Nanjing's real estate market sees a resurgence of 'price difference compensation' - China News Network"
Yangzi Evening News reported (by reporter Ma Zuobo) that Yangzi Evening News/Zi Niu News reporters discovered in an interview on the 10th that the "price protection agreement", which had not been seen for more than ten years, has returned to the Nanjing property market. A property development in the Jiangbei New District claimed "price difference compensation". If the discounts on other properties before the handover are greater than the previous discounts, the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
The conditions of the "insurance agreement" can be numerous.
The property located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. A prospective buyer, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the property last weekend.
The picture he sent to reporters showed that the developer of the property promised that anyone who purchased a property between February 1 and February 28 would, from the date of signing the sales contract to the delivery of the corresponding property, if the discount on other properties in the project was greater than the discount previously enjoyed (limited to other unsold properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type), the developer could change the property for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun stated that the property consultant said this was actually a "price protection agreement," designed to reassure buyers and prevent them from worrying about the developer lowering prices for promotions. "The fear now is that the price will drop after purchase. There's no time to make a fuss at the sales office, and it's indeed frustrating if you don't complain," he said.
Many homebuyers believe that while "price protection agreements" are meant to reassure purchasers, the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a house in Jiangbei, said that the houses with a guaranteed price must first be of the same type, and also in the same building and unit. There are very few houses for buyers to compare prices, so the "threshold" is still quite high.
Some homebuyers believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that extra concessions may be given during sales, and it is not easy for buyers to "defend their rights".
Whether homebuyers can be retained remains to be seen.
A reporter found out from Nanjing's online real estate that the property launched a total of 252 units in two buildings last November, with apartment sizes of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, and 129 square meters, etc. The average selling price for fully furnished units was 39,843 yuan per square meter.
However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this property is 157, accounting for 62.3% of the total. Among them, there are 128 units in Building 8, with 113 unsold units. Out of 124 units in Building 7, 44 are unsold. The total number of transactions for the project is only 33 units, accounting for just 13%.
Market insiders explained that the "price protection agreement" had also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, to attract buyers, the real estate development on Huangshan Road in Hexi, Hengtang West Garden, launched a "Price Guarantee Plan". The specific content was "The company solemnly promises that if the discount range of the project expands within a year, the company will return the difference to the old owners."
In April 2011, nine real estate developments in Nanjing also offered a portion of their properties with a "price difference compensation" promise.
"The real estate market is recovering, and it needs a 'cardiotonic' more than ever at this moment."
"Price protection agreements are also one of the marketing strategies of real estate companies," said Mr. Shen, a veteran operator in the Nanjing real estate industry.
He believes that nowadays, property developers need confidence more than homebuyers, and the introduction of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually a morale booster for them.
As for whether homebuyers can be retained, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, which still need to be observed for now.
Multiple data declines, Taiwan's economy starts the year poorly - China News Network.
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11th (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) - With export trade volume experiencing five consecutive months of decline, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) shrinking for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) once again hitting the "3-digit" mark... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts have analysed that the Taiwanese economy's performance at the start of the year was not good, and there is significant pressure for growth.
According to the financial authorities in Taiwan, the region's exports in January of this year amounted to $31.51 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The export value of all 11 major categories of goods declined compared to the same period last year.
The largest declines were in rubber and plastic products and optical equipment, which fell by 37.6% and 35.7% respectively over the year.
Exports of electronic components fell by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits fell by 18.3% annually, marking the largest decline in 14 years.
The head of the department's statistics bureau, Cai Meina, stated that this shows a diffusion of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry, indicating that the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that in January, both imports and exports in Taiwan decreased, with a trade surplus of only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial authority in Taiwan believes that due to the global decrease in terminal demand and industry inventory adjustments suppressing manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials, the decline in exports is unlikely to improve in the short term. The decline in Taiwan's exports in the first quarter of this year may be worse than expected.
According to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Taiwan's manufacturing sector was 40.4% in January of this year, a continuous contraction for seven months, and a decrease of 3.3 percentage points from December of the previous year.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, PMI uses 50% as the boom-bust line. An index greater than 50% represents economic expansion, while less than 50% indicates contraction.
In January, among the five components of Taiwan's PMI, new orders, production and employment contracted, supplier delivery times fell, and inventory tightened.
All six industries reported a contraction in PMI, with the industries ranked by contraction speed as follows: power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optics industry (35.2%), chemical and biotech medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation equipment industry (42.6%), and food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Taiwan authorities' "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics" announced that the annual increase rate of Taiwan's CPI in January this year was 3.04%, breaking 3% again since last July.
Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special commissioner of the Taiwan "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics," admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was indeed beyond expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, indicating that inflationary pressure still exists and remains high.
Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism, according to reports from local media such as the United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.
Professor Wu Dare from the Department of Economics at Central University in Taiwan analyzed that a decline in exports could cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing firms, increasing the risk of debt default.
At the same time, a decrease in orders led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impacted consumer spending power.
Taiwan Economic Research Institute researcher Qiu Dasheng believes that this year's inflation situation in Europe and America has not been resolved, demand continues to shrink, and it is predicted that Taiwan's export recession will continue into the first half of the year.
As Taiwan's economy is export-driven, the economic growth for the year will not be as good as last year due to the downturn in exports.
"The Important Engine of Global Recovery" - China News Network
"In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has demonstrated strong resilience."
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
"Julio Rios, a well-known Spanish expert on China and honorary advisor to the China Policy Watch Network, recently told our reporter in an interview that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios stated that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is steadfast in expanding its openness to the outside world, the endogenous driving force of economic development is constantly strengthening, with state-owned enterprises and private enterprises developing in coordination.
Every year, the two sessions of the National People's Congress of China are held, where representatives and members discuss major national development plans and hot issues concerning people's livelihoods, widely gathering consensus, rallying public support, and pooling wisdom to add strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and is currently entering a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to Chinese wisdom and solutions, and expects China's development to bring new opportunities to the world.
"China is currently pushing for technological innovation with full force, injecting new momentum into economic and social development," Rios said. "Investment, talent cultivation, policy incentives, all these keep China vibrant in the new five-year plan."
In Rios' view, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China both leverages the strengths of the market economy and the superiority of the socialist system, taking proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting private, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing development, insisting on innovative development, promoting employment, improving the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meeting the diverse consumption needs of the people... China's complete, accurate, and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, striving to promote high-quality development, and building a new development pattern, will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal of the "Belt and Road" initiative.
The stabilization and recovery of the economy after the pandemic is a common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world, becoming an important engine for global recovery.
Rios stated that he looks forward to the continued role of the "Belt and Road" cooperation in improving the infrastructure level of various countries, strengthening interconnectivity in various fields, and continuing to release greater potential.

Save half or even more on costs?
Henan Province standardizes and integrates the price of oral implant medical services - China News Network.
According to CCTV News: Dental implants are the ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the cost, often tens of thousands per tooth, has deterred many.
Since the beginning of this year, with the accelerated implementation of centralized procurement of dental implants, various places have also put the price reduction of dental implants on the agenda.
Starting from February 10, the full-process price control target for conventional dental implant medical services in Henan Province is 4300 yuan, and the full-process cost of a single conventional implant should not exceed 97% of the control target.
Dental implantation refers to a method of tooth restoration that uses an underlying structure implanted in the bone tissue to support and stabilize the upper dental prosthesis.
Reporters learned from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University that, taking a single conventional implant as an example, the price from implantation to final restoration is about 16,000 to 17,000 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that in my case, it would be around 8,000 yuan, less than 10,000 yuan, basically saving half.
Based on the current project, Henan Province has also integrated and determined 15 oral implantation medical service price items such as "implantation fee (per piece)", and uniformly formulated the price and medical insurance payment category of provincial public medical institutions, cancelling or adjusting 20 medical service price items such as dental implant surgery.
Li Yunjie, Director of the Pharmaceutical Price and Tender Procurement Department of Zhengzhou Medical Security Bureau: The main beneficiaries are fourfold: medical insurance, which has less expenditure; hospitals, which have less pressure; suppliers, who have gained a market; and our patients, who are the biggest beneficiaries, as the cost of implanting a tooth may be halved or even more.
Shenzhen: Building the nation's first and world-leading pioneer city for high-speed development - China News Network.
On February 11, according to the "Shenzhen Industrial Information" WeChat public account, the Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Industry and Information Technology recently issued the "Shenzhen City Pioneer City Construction Action Plan".
It proposed that by the end of 2023, a super broadband network with high speed, large capacity, and low latency would be built to achieve the network construction goals of "double gigabit, all-optical network, 1 millisecond, and Internet of Everything", creating the country's first and world-leading ultra-fast pioneer city.

With the emergence of "new variables" in China's e-commerce industry, how can "content be king" in driving sales?
- China News Service
On February 11, China News Service reported: "New variables" emerge in China's e-commerce industry, how to achieve "content is king" in product promotion?
China News Financial Reporter Xia Bin
"We entered the e-commerce game late, but from the very beginning, we realized that in order to stand out from the countless shops, content is very important.
Fangfang, a post-90s girl from Guangdong, is currently operating a nourishing food ingredient shop on Douyin, making a 30-year-old offline shop "bloom" online.
Imitating the style of old Hong Kong films and accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, opening the @FangFangOnePersonFood TikTok account offers refreshing and beautifully crafted videos.
At the recent Douyin e-commerce "Looking for Companions · High-quality Content Sharing Session", Fangfang, as a representative of high-quality creators, spoke about her daily creative experiences and insights.
She said on the spot, "The carefully polished videos have attracted a lot of netizens' attention, many people are interested in the ingredients in my home, want to cook along, and the sales channel suddenly opened up.
" "
Fangfang used soup-making videos to make more people fall in love with the "taste of old Guangdong". In one live broadcast, she sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing ingredients, saving her family's nearly bankrupt old store.
"With no content, there is no e-commerce." As short video and live-streaming e-commerce continue to develop, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early stages of live-streaming sales, live-stream rooms often attracted users with low-price discounts, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been both phenomenal influencers like Liu Genghong and Dongfang Zhenxuan, as well as many experts and merchants in niche fields that are not well-known to the public. They have improved their long-term business benefits by continuously creating high-quality content that aligns with their brand's tone.
Gao Yaxuan, the head of operations for Douyin's e-commerce star authors, explained that over the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Douyin's e-commerce platform, with their content creation volume increasing by 252% and total transaction volume more than doubling.
"Behind these numbers, we can sense a thriving and vibrant author ecosystem.
"Gao Yaxuan said."
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of the "new variable" - quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data perspective, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the e-commerce industry content ecosystem health index ranking in the above report, Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com are in the top five.
The report suggests that the content ecosystem in the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce with content. However, not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (Professionally Generated Content) and UGC (User Generated Content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the scenarios for consumption and promotion, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, and the stronger the commercial value. The proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption in this gradually integrated public and private domain will also be higher.
At the event, Yu Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University and the chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Committee, provided an analysis and interpretation of the report.
He stated that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from the "consumer accessibility" stage to the "consumer quality" stage, and high-quality, professional, differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and focus of the new stage of e-commerce development, with paid knowledge, professional knowledge, and KOL (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC content starting to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking towards the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming proposed two suggestions.
One perspective is to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecosystem from the perspective of content structure enhancement, to create positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve a dynamic balance of the health system index of the e-commerce industry content ecosystem.
Another perspective is from the external ecology, to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
"The future of e-commerce still needs more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to form predictions for stable future development; in addition, it needs to provide merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, to achieve value synergy among enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and to jointly create a healthy content ecosystem."

Xinhua News Agency commentator: Promoting modernization with Chinese characteristics is a systematic project - Four discussions on deeply understanding General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the study and implementation of the spirit of the 20th Party Congress - China News Network.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th - Title: Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project - the fourth discussion on deeply understanding General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the study and implementation of the spirit of the 20th Party Congress seminar.
Xinhua News Agency commentator
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires overall planning, systematic planning, and overall advancement. It is necessary to properly handle a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, adherence to principles and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up to the outside world.
At the opening ceremony of the seminar for the study and implementation of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and the spirit of the 20th Party Congress by the new members and alternate members of the Central Committee and the main leaders of the provincial and ministerial levels, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, deeply and systematically clarified a series of major relationships that need to be handled well in practice, providing us with a scientific methodology to vigorously promote modernization with Chinese characteristics.
Promoting modernization with Chinese characteristics involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization. It relates to the governance of the party, the country, and the military, domestic and foreign affairs, and defense. It requires both systematic planning and the courage to reform and innovate, continuously achieving overall progress.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to deeply understand the world's development trends, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, and make the formulated plans and policy systems reflect the characteristics of the times, grasp the regularity, and be creative, achieving a combination of near and far, top-down coherence, and content coordination.
Promoting modernization in the Chinese style is an exploratory endeavor, with many unknown areas that need to be boldly explored in practice, and the development of the cause needs to be promoted through reform and innovation, and we must not stick to old ways or wait for opportunities to come.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party or a country.
To advance modernization with Chinese characteristics, we need to enhance the foresight of our strategy, using scientific strategic foresight to anticipate and lead the future; we need to enhance the overall nature of our strategy, focusing on solving major issues that affect the rise and fall of the Party and the country's cause, and that have far-reaching implications; we need to enhance the stability of our strategy, once a strategy is formed, we must persist in the long term, stick to it, and do it well.
To scientifically grasp the dialectical unity of strategy and tactics, to organically combine the principled nature of strategy and the flexibility of tactics, to be flexible and adaptable, to make decisions on the spot, and to take the initiative in strategy by adapting to local conditions, responding to situations, and acting in accordance with the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds tradition and fosters innovation.
In managing the relationship between upholding tradition and promoting innovation, we must steadfastly adhere to the essence, essential requirements, and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, ensuring its correct direction, while also placing innovation at the forefront of national development. We must meet the demands of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively adapt to changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously create new momentum and advantages for development, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation of fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
In advancing Chinese-style modernization, we aim to create efficiency higher than that of capitalism, while more effectively maintaining social fairness, and better achieving a balance, mutual promotion, and unity between efficiency and fairness.
Manage the relationship between efficiency and fairness, continuously achieve development for the people, development relying on the people, and the results of development shared by the people, allowing the benefits of modernization to be more equitably enjoyed by all.
To promote modernization in the Chinese style, it is necessary to balance vitality and order, making society both vibrant and stable.
It is necessary to coordinate development and security, implement a comprehensive national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to maintain national security, and firmly safeguard the security of national political power, system, ideology, and key areas.
While considering safety factors more in development, enhancing national security strength through development, and using the results of development to solidify the foundation of national security, it is also good at creating a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, constantly stimulating development vitality, and achieving a positive interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
To promote modernization with Chinese characteristics, we must both persist in our own path and broaden our global perspective, persist in opening up to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of modernization with Chinese characteristics.
We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, insist on basing the development of the nation and the people on our own strength, and firmly hold the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level openness to the outside world, deeply participate in global industrial division and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.
Only by following the path can one go far.
Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and guided by the scientific principles of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, let us grasp the laws, persevere, fully exert our initiative and creativity, correctly handle a series of major relationships, strive to make progress on the new journey of fully building a modern socialist country, and continuously open up new horizons for modernization with Chinese characteristics.
The Biden administration on Friday (February 10) blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in a spy balloon program, according to Deutsche Welle Chinese.
The US Department of Commerce stated that these five Chinese companies and one research institution have helped modernize the Chinese military, particularly in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist have difficulty obtaining technology exports from the United States.
The list is known as the "entity list," and companies on it cannot purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The companies listed on the blacklist are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group's 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House had indicated it was considering broader measures to "expose and address" larger-scale surveillance activities by China that threatened US national security.
The balloon incident further escalated tensions between China and the United States, leading US Secretary of State Blinken to cancel his trip to China.
On February 4th, the United States shot down a balloon, leading the Chinese government to lodge a serious protest with the US embassy in China, criticizing the US for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and progress towards stable Sino-US relations.
From the existing wreckage evidence and information from China's military procurement platform, the US government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon had a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army and was an approved supplier for the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding an incident where a Chinese unmanned civilian airship accidentally entered US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, she added that the relevant resolutions of the US Congress were purely political manipulation and hype.
China strongly disapproves and firmly opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce, said: "Today's action demonstrates our joint efforts to identify and stop China's use of spy balloons that violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 other countries."
" "
A Reuters report stated that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. claimed to be unaware of the sanctions and refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on this information.

Several days have passed since the earthquake in parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is fading. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday brought immense relief to the rescuers. (Deutsche Welle Chinese Network)
According to the Associated Press, a family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the heavily affected town of Nurdai in Gaziantep province.
Rescue workers first pulled the mother and daughter from the rubble, then found the father, but he insisted on rescuing his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were successfully rescued under harsh cold weather conditions.
What day is it today?
"This," asked the boy who had been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours after being brought back to the surface by his rescuers.

The miraculous success of the rescue operation brought a glimmer of hope to the originally bleak search and rescue work, but at the same time, the number of casualties continued to rise.
According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has already caused over 20,000 deaths in Turkey, with the death toll in neighbouring Syria estimated to be over 3,500.
Despite experts stating that a person could survive for more than a week after being trapped in rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim.
Rescue workers are still using thermal imaging cameras to search for signs of life under the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of the rescue efforts began to shift towards helping those survivors who were in urgent need of assistance.

Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, attended the graduation ceremony and delivered a concluding speech.

We must strive to master the theoretical skills of Marxism, consciously arm our minds with the party's innovative theories, guide practice, and promote work. We must put effort into deep learning, careful understanding, and diligent practice, truly learning firm belief, absolute loyalty, and a sense of mission.
We must implement the decisions and plans of the Party's 20th Congress with a spirit of striving and dedication, solidly promote modernization with Chinese characteristics, roll up our sleeves and work hard, throw ourselves into the role of "construction team leader", and turn the blueprint into reality step by step.
We must always remember that the comprehensive and strict governance of the party is always on the road, and the self-revolution of the party is always on the road. We must tighten and implement the political responsibility of the comprehensive and strict governance of the party, take the political construction of the party as the guide, and deeply promote the new great project of the party's construction in the new era.
To enhance the ability to promote high-quality development, serve the public, and prevent and resolve risks, we must vigorously promote the spirit of investigation and research, and resolutely prevent and overcome formalism and bureaucracy.

Google AI chatbot "answers question incorrectly," parent company's stock value evaporates by hundreds of billions of dollars.
(Comprehensive news from the 11th)
Google's newly launched AI chatbot, Bard, had a poor start, "answering questions incorrectly" in promotional videos, causing Alphabet's stock price to plummet by 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark, and evaporating $110 billion in market value (approximately 476.5 billion ringgit), closing at $94.57 on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as competitive as its rival Microsoft.
According to a Reuters report, Google earlier posted a promotional video on social media for its AI chatbot Bard, in which someone asked Bard, "What new discoveries about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year-old child?"
In his response, Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first photo of an exoplanet in the solar system.
However, according to data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the first photo of an exoplanet was taken by the European Southern Observatory's "Very Large Telescope" in 2004.
Reuters reported with the headline "Alphabet stock plummets after Bard answers incorrectly."
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "highlighted the importance of rigorous testing processes," and would combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure Bard's response "meets high standards in terms of quality, safety, and accurate information."
Singapore's tourism industry rebounds strongly with a 19-fold increase in inbound tourists compared to 2021.
The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that it expects the number of international visitors to Singapore to reach 12 to 14 million by 2023, bringing in about 18 to 21 billion Singapore dollars in tourism revenue; the number of visitors and tourism revenue will recover to about 67% to 75% of the levels before the 2019 coronavirus pandemic; there is a high possibility of a full recovery in the tourism industry by 2024.
In 2022, the Singapore tourism market gradually restarted and recovered.
The latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that the number of inbound tourists in 2022 increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million, surpassing the board's earlier estimate of 4 to 6 million. Tourism has now recovered to 33% of pre-pandemic levels.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled 8.96 billion Singapore dollars. It is estimated that the total tourism revenue for 2022 can reach 13.8 to 14.3 billion Singapore dollars, an increase of 6 to 7 times compared to 1.89 billion Singapore dollars in 2021, and has recovered to about 50% to 52% of the level before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced a grant of nearly 500 million Singapore dollars to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The tourism board recently announced plans to allocate 110 million Singapore dollars from its budget over the next two years to introduce more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In order to make health and wellness a highlight of Singapore's tourism, the Singapore Tourism Board launched an intention solicitation event on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, the Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists are putting their health first in their considerations.
The development of a health and wellness attraction in the Marina South area, which includes the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism industry and economy, encouraging tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
The Director of the Singapore Tourism Board, Chen Jianlong, stated that health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products in the coming years.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
For this reason, the tourism bureau has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held its first Health and Wellness Festival, offering the public over 130 different health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, Central Beach Market at Sentosa, the new "Exploring New Territories" exhibition hall at the ArtScience Museum, and the new open-air theatre at the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Bird Park at Wildlife Reserves Singapore, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will establish industry standards for the sustainable development of the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) sector within 2023, with a focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions, further optimizing the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Changi Airport has strongly recovered, with as many as 150,000 passengers received daily, about 1 million per week, which is approximately 75% of the pre-COVID-19 level. The number of aviation industry employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has already received 23.6 million visitors, equivalent to 42% of the pre-COVID-19 level, with 170,000 flights taking off and landing, which is 53% of the pre-pandemic level.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry also drove the recovery of the accommodation, transportation, catering, and shopping industries.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
The Assistant Director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, Ke Shudan, said that a survey by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore's safety index ranked in the top three globally, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is popular among Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 3.6 million people from China traveled to Singapore for vacation each year.
With China relaxing its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists this year can recover to between 30% and 60% of the 2019 levels.
Ko Shu-tan pointed out that the tourism bureau will closely monitor China's signals for further relaxation of outbound travel policies to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board is actively preparing to welcome Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking ahead to the 2023 tourism market, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that as long as there is no significant economic downturn affecting public income, and no new widespread deadly epidemics, the recovery of the tourism industry will be faster than expected.

She gently cradled her father's cheeks with her hands and even touched his chest, with the father-daughter interaction being broadcast nationwide.
However, the First Lady, Li Xue, could only step aside.
According to reports from South Korea's "Chosun News" and others, Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju brought their daughter Kim Ju-ae to a banquet on the 7th. In the official group photo, Kim Ju-ae not only sat in the middle between her parents, but also joined Kim Jong-un on the podium at the 75th anniversary military parade the next evening.
The North Korean official media "Korean Central Television" later released parade footage, revealing more scenes of deep father-daughter affection.
Kim Jong-un exchanged glances with his daughter several times on the podium, their smiles never fading, and they whispered to each other. At one point, Kim's daughter cupped her father's cheeks with her hands, to which Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media images also showed Kim Yo-jong sitting with Kim Jong-un on an indoor sofa, constantly touching her father's face with her hand; when she walked hand in hand with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hand.
The First Lady, Li Xue, could only walk behind or sit aside throughout the process, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
Korean media pointed out that since Kim Jong Un's first public appearance during the Mars-17 missile test on November 18 last year, his exposure has been increasing over the past three months, and this is already his fifth appearance at an official event.
When North Korean state media mentioned Kim Jong-un, they used extremely high honorifics such as "most beloved brother" and "noble brother", and also broadcast clips of Kim Jong-un repeatedly shouting pledges of allegiance to the Baekdu bloodline from the viewing stand during the parade.
These signs led to speculation that Kim Jo Ai had been designated as the successor to the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong Un is pushing his teenage daughter into the position of successor," but there are also views that such a judgment is still premature, and in the situation where Kim Jong Un has a son, all possibilities are still preserved.
Chongyang Q&A: How to view the US non-farm employment data in January greatly exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
Q: How does Chongyang Investment view the significantly better-than-expected non-farm employment data in the US in January and its future trend?
On February 3rd, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the non-farm employment data for January 2023, with an increase of 517,000 non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; the year-on-year wage growth was 4.4%, and the month-on-month growth was 0.3%, slightly slowing down.
In terms of the total amount, this data is subject to many one-time and technical factors, such as returning striking teachers, revisions to the survey statistical caliber, updates to the seasonal adjustment factor, and may be revised in the future (refer to the January 2022 non-farm payroll revision from 504,000 to 364,000). Non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data suggests.
Structurally, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still present, but the proportion is relatively low; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have seen a significant rebound in new employment, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
Given the equally larger-than-expected rise in service sector PMI, job vacancies, labor shortage data, and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector has experienced a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that it is difficult to improve the tension between supply and demand in the US job market without going through a recession.
Currently, there is still a supply gap of over 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds, which is close to the pre-pandemic peak.
In addition, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit among US residents, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the job market.
The continued tension in the US job market supply and demand will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.
With the current overlay nearing the end of rate hikes and inflation expectations constantly fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth.
Before the data was released, the US stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Federal Reserve has been maintaining a delicate balance of fragile market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes. However, the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish rhetoric, not only expecting an early halt to rate hikes, but also expecting two rate cuts by the end of the year.
In a labor market with tight supply and demand, and unclear effects of tightening policies, we believe that the Federal Reserve's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some damage to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the year-on-year M2 data turning negative and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-item leading indicators, the US CPI data has entered a rapid decline stage since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.
The founder of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led the transformation of China's first clothing stock - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
On February 11, a WeChat public account certified by Shanshan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") announced the death of Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings. Zheng passed away on February 10, 2023, due to a sudden heart disease, at the age of 65, reported by Zheng Yuxin, a journalist from Economic Observer.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory, and with his transfer, he became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Shares, in 1989.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Business Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the Chinese suit market of the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand once reached as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Shares (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's clothing industry.
Just as the clothing business was booming, the Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and the possibility of Shanshan suits always leading the trend and becoming the national dress of the Chinese people in the long term is not great."
In 1999, Shanshan began researching corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled, "We came to Shanghai to figure out what to do with the transformation. We specifically sought out many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and theoretical seminars."
Finally, we have set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is "great health has a future".
After determining the strategic direction, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, a carbon research institute supporting Ansteel, was conducting a national 863 project with insufficient research funding. Therefore, Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere" project, engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and promote the commercial use of negative electrode materials domestically.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. achieved large-scale production of mesophase pitch microspheres, began domestic substitution, and replaced Japan as the main supplier of mesophase pitch microspheres in China.
This is the first Chinese company to produce anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, achieving the domestic production of these materials.
With the rapid popularization of lithium batteries, Sunsun Shares' lithium battery business began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into Sunsun Shares' main business, and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year, until 2013, when the revenue from Sunsun Shares' lithium battery material business fully surpassed the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Shangjin Optoelectronics. The technology in this field is relatively advanced, and Shanshan's main competitors are Fortune 500 companies such as Samsung from South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical from Japan, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his insights on post-investment management, "Why do acquisitions of some high-tech companies internationally by China's private enterprises have a relatively low success rate? Why do those acquisitions fail?
"Everyone would consider, 'I've spent so much money, I need to send someone to manage it, right?' This is a common behavior," however, Zheng Yonggang was different. On the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shanjing Optoelectronics that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjing, decided to implement a 'one enterprise, two systems' policy. Apart from Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, no one from Shanshan Enterprises would be sent to Shanjing. They would adopt an authorized management approach, and the original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models would remain unchanged.
ICC Xinlu Information released negative pole data for 2022, showing that Shanshan's negative pole shipments exceeded 200,000 tons in 2022, an increase of 100% year-on-year, with a market share of 16%. The shipment volume of synthetic graphite negative pole materials remained at the top.
In the polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the company's subsidiary, Sugimoto Optoelectronics, reached a global market share of 29% in 2022, and it is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, with a net profit of 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, the stock price of Shanshan Co., Ltd. was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9th, Sunshine Holdings stated on its interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project is still ramping up.
According to Wind, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan Shares.
According to Tianyancha, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total shares in Shanshan Holdings Limited.
The general manager of Shanshan Shares is Li Zhihua, born in 1968, who has served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.
On February 10, Suning Shares stated on the investor interaction platform that there is no kinship between the company's senior management and the actual controller of the company.
"The Fund E-Account is here: The Securities Regulatory Commission authorizes development - Investors can aggregate and query all funds under their name - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website"
Is the complexity of fund purchasing channels leading to difficulties in account information collection? - Economic Observer Network reporter Chen Shan.
Always forgetting the "petty cash"?
These issues of the citizens are about to be resolved.
On February 10th, the Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the "Fund E-account" APP was launched and began public beta testing in various mobile app stores.
The "Fund E-account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" inquiry service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve the industry service pain points such as forgotten accounts and cumbersome inquiries for the majority of small and medium investors.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, managing approximately 26 trillion yuan in funds; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
The share registration agency account systems are independent of each other, lacking a unified industry query channel.
Industry insiders have stated that by the end of 2021, China had over 720 million fund investors, meaning that half of the country's population had invested in fund products.
Previously, investors had to inquire about purchase conditions through different sales agencies, but with the "Fund E-account", they can check the conditions of all purchases through all sales channels, making the status of fund holdings clear at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
According to related documents, the "Fund E Account" APP is a mobile application for the public fund industry developed and built by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with a one-stop query of the off-market shareholding situation of all market public fund products.
Investors can conveniently and quickly grasp their holdings of public fund products under various fund managers purchased through all market sales channels through the "Fund E-account", greatly improving the efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through the "Fund E-account" includes: the fund account information opened at all public fund managers in the market, the trading account information opened at public fund sales institutions, and the off-market shareholding situation of products including publicly raised securities investment funds and collective asset management plans set up and managed by securities companies, where the number of investors is not limited to 200.
Liu Yiqian, the head of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told reporters from the Economic Observer that investors can use the "Fund E-account" App to get a one-stop understanding of all their off-market public fund holdings, helping them to retrieve "forgotten assets". More importantly, it provides a comprehensive collection of all account information on fund investments, helping customers to grasp their own investment situation more timely, accurately, and completely, thereby better optimizing their own fund portfolio allocation and better planning their own financial arrangements.
How to register for use?
Reporters noted that the "Fund E-account" APP is currently available in Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo and other mobile app stores, but the APP is still in the public trial operation stage, registration requires an invitation code, and investors can contact the fund manager of the funds they hold to obtain it.
A customer service representative from a medium to large public fund in Shanghai provided a six-digit invitation code to a reporter from Economic Observer Online, and said, "During the APP trial operation stage, China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager. When investors call to get them, we will provide them."
After the trial run is over, users can register without needing an invitation code.
" "
A journalist registered and completed a search based on the "Fund E-account" download and usage instructions related documents displayed on the official website of the Securities Regulatory Commission. The whole process took only a few minutes and mainly consisted of four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After completing the real-name authentication, by clicking the "Asset" fund binding button, all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are presented in the binding option list (accounts that can be bound). After completing the binding, you can intuitively see the total assets of the invested funds and start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E-account" only provides inquiry services for investors and cannot carry out subscription and redemption transactions.
The data displayed in the "Fund E Account" is generally dated three trading days prior to the date of the user's query (T day).
For example, if you open the "Fund E-account" on February 10th, the total assets, fund shares, and net value of the fund displayed on the asset page correspond to the date three trading days prior, which is February 7th.

The US, Japan, and the Philippines reach a defense consensus against the Chinese Communist Party.
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
Both sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's infringement of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement stating that they would conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of a tripartite defense agreement with the United States, opposing the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes that this meeting will help Japan and the Philippines establish policies for the Taiwan Strait crisis.
In early January of this year, Marcos Jr. visited China and secured agreements worth 20 billion dollars.
But after this, not only did Sino-Philippine relations not improve, they actually deteriorated.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to US forces, ensuring the security of the South China Sea.
A newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan, which is also the closest location to China.
If a crisis occurs in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from its bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have now formed an axis with the United States, constructing a "counter-CCP arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan conveyed Song Tao's message during his visit to China: under the 1992 Consensus, the Green Camp is welcome to visit the mainland.
The Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang of Taiwan, Xia Liyan, met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People's Republic of China, Song Tao, and the Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Wang Huning, during his visit to China.
In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT's official organization, the National Policy Foundation, positively evaluated Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan, saying that as long as they recognize the "1992 Consensus" and oppose Taiwan independence, mainland China welcomes visits from the Green Camp.
The Kuomintang considered it a novelty.
The news of the day did not mention this statement when Xia Liyan met with Song Tao earlier.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan has been clarifying its refusal to accept the "1992 Consensus" in recent days.
According to Central News Agency today, the vice chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Liyan, led a delegation to visit mainland China. During his stay in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee.
During his meeting with Song Tao, Xia Liyan discussed that the political foundation of the KMT and the CCP is the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT's National Policy Foundation, stated in the meeting that the KMT's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was different from the previous meetings he had attended.
In recent video conferences with mainland scholars, and in this discussion, there was no talk of military unification or the "Anti-Secession Law." Instead, the focus was on resuming exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that in the face of military tensions across the strait, mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the people and the communists, the other side is still willing to do a good job for the people of Taiwan, indicating that they do not want cross-strait relations to deteriorate.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning personally instructed Song Tao, saying "You must implement the demands raised by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen). If you can't solve everything, you should handle it on a case-by-case basis."
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang visitors to the mainland had directly addressed the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and ships, the agricultural and fishing issues in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the Central News Agency reporters had asked such questions.
The French unions mobilize again against the government's retirement reform plan in a large march.
On Saturday (February 11), French unions once again launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's pension reform bill, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This was the fourth day of action in the social movement against the government's proposed pension reform bill.
The number of people who respond to the call for a rally could potentially influence the next course of action for union groups.
This was the fourth nationwide mobilization jointly initiated by France's eight major trade unions in a month, and the first time the protest activities were scheduled for a Saturday.
Given that for most French people, Saturday is a day off, they do not need to choose between participating in protest demonstrations or losing wages due to a strike. Therefore, union groups hope that today's rally can attract more participants.
The unions of the bus system, subway, and public railway companies did not call for a strike today, so the bus system should operate normally. Citizens can take the bus to the rally site, and in areas where schools have started winter vacation, people can start their holidays as usual.
Union groups hoped that over a million people would attend the rally today, while police estimated national attendance could be between 600,000 and 800,000, with between 90,000 and 120,000 people possibly gathering in central Paris.
Since the start of the anti-government pension reform protests, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support the measure to delay the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in marches has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 rallied between 1.27 million to 2.5 million people nationwide.
However, the number of demonstrators this Tuesday (February 7th) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
The pension reform proposal is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition, especially the radical left-wing opposition, submitted countless amendments, slowing down the review process significantly.
The debate between the ruling and opposition parties is becoming increasingly intense and sharp.
A member of the radical left-wing party France Unbowed recently posted a picture on social media of himself stepping on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly ultimately announced a 15-day ban on this member participating in parliamentary activities as a punishment for this behavior.
Despite this reform proposal sparking the largest social movement in France in over 20 years, the government has so far made only minor adjustments to the draft and has not made any significant concessions.
The union is prepared to take action again on Thursday the 16th, and plans to organize a demonstration on March 7th when the reform bill is submitted to the Senate for discussion.
China encourages increasing birth rates, urging high-quality sperm donations in universities.
The Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province, China, issued a call on the 9th for donations from individuals with a college degree or higher, or current students. Successful donors who donate 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of 4500 yuan.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message topped the Weibo hot search list that day, and sparked follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to a report by the Liberty Times, China is encouraging university students to donate sperm.
Among all the universities where sperm donation takes place, Beijing has the highest requirements. In addition to education, they also require a height of over 170 cm, regular facial features, no obvious hair loss, and nearsightedness not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Province Human Sperm Bank stated that sperm donors could receive a full set of men's health check-ups worth 1000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never done before, are of great significance for understanding their own fertility status."
The conditions for sperm donors include being over 165 cm tall, having a college degree or higher or currently studying, and not having genetic diseases or infectious diseases such as color blindness or hepatitis B.
Reports cited China's Tianmu News as saying that the Shaanxi Province Human Sperm Bank had printed promotional posters with the slogan "Paid sperm donation, unlimited glory," calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to forward related information, "to pass on the love."
In Shaanxi province, the price is higher than in Yunnan, with qualified individuals receiving 300 RMB in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of donations can receive a subsidy of 5000 RMB.
The highest known subsidy is currently in Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5150 RMB.
The last East German Communist Prime Minister has passed away.
The successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95."
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
" "
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Modrow stated that he would help transform East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, due to protesters across East Germany demanding democracy and freedom, the Communist Party leaders were forced to step down.
After coming to power in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev called for reforms in Eastern Europe under Soviet leadership.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as Prime Minister.
Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that occurred in October 1990.
He was also criticised for trying to reform rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modro was found guilty of election fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but was not imprisoned.
Some say these allegations are politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament, and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a member of the European Parliament.
Modrow saw himself as a reformer and hoped to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want East Germany to return, but said that East Germany's achievements should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland) and received training as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a youth fire brigade platoon leader and became a member of the Nazi militia organization Volkssturm near the end of the conflict, which conscripted men aged 16 to 60 for the final struggle of the war.
At the age of 17, Modro was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a staunch communist.
In 1949, the year East Germany was established, he returned home and found a job as a mechanic, continued his studies in social sciences and economics, and earned a doctorate degree.
Modrow was a worker in the Free German Youth movement, which nearly all East German young people joined, and he rose to become the chairman of the party in the Dresden region through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran commemorates revolution anniversary, hackers supporting the protest hacked the president's televised speech.
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ebrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The President's live television speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, with the screen displaying the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers called "Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)."
There was also a voice shouting, "Death to the Islamic Republic."
According to a Reuters report today, Iran's commemoration of the anniversary of the revolution was interrupted by hackers disrupting the national television broadcast.
As Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, the hardline government of Raisi faces the boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their resignation. However, Raisi still calls for the "deceived youth" to repent so they can receive the pardon of Iran's supreme leader.
Nationwide protests swept across Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iran's security forces carried out a deadly crackdown on protests, one of the most formidable challenges faced by the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution that overthrew 2500 years of monarchy.
As part of a general amnesty to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities released imprisoned dissident Fahad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelkhah on Friday, who had been on a hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a pardon, which included some prisoners arrested in recent anti-government protests.
According to a report by the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report stated that an additional 70 government security personnel were killed.
It is believed that as many as 19,763 protesters were arrested.
For several weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been urging people to vote in Saturday's rally to show opposition to protest activities and support for the government.
On the Friday night of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showcased fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebrations, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)
However, many people at the rally could also be heard shouting "Death to the dictator!"
"Death of the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, the government television station broadcast live footage of official gatherings from all over the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment were displayed.
President Lecy's speeches were often interrupted by the slogan "Death to America" - a signature chant at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel."
Reuters reported that Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security.
They later placed her under house arrest, but she returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah denied these allegations.
A week before Mesami was released, supporters warned that he was at risk of death due to his hunger strike protest.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.
The French Foreign Ministry responded on Friday to Adelkhah's release, calling for the restoration of her freedom, "including, if she wishes, allowing her to return to France."

Did the balloon incident open America's eyes?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China.
According to a report in the Wall Street Journal today, the US is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China following the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials have said that the aforementioned balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China, and will be used to garner more political support for strengthening US technology protection.
The United States claimed that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official at the US Central Intelligence Agency and now working at the New America Security Center, a think tank in Washington.
"This undoubtedly added fuel to the fire, supporting the views of the hardliners towards China."
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking broader actions to expose and address China's larger-scale surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security as well as our allies and partners."
"US officials have reported the balloon incident to the governments of more than 30 countries," said American officials, adding that international coordination is crucial in dealing with the threat from China.
Senior researcher Emily Benso from the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established Special Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party in the US House of Representatives could also pressure the US to take stricter measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress would face increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which could in turn force the White House to adopt a more hardline policy.
The Wall Street Journal reported that many advocates for stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of these controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government is also developing a foreign investment review program to examine whether US investments abroad pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to roll out the plan more quickly.
Relief efforts for the Turkey-Syria earthquake continue day and night.
Since the strong earthquake in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night in the ruins of thousands of destroyed buildings, rescuing survivors buried under the rubble.
In the freezing temperatures, they often called for silence as they strained to hear any signs of life from the rubble of the shattered concrete.
According to a Reuters report today, two more women were rescued after surviving several days in the rubble of the earthquake.
However, the death toll from the earthquake rose to 24,150 people.
The death toll in Turkey was 20,665, while in Syria it exceeded 3,500.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday, followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighbouring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake in the northwest of Turkey in 1999 resulted in the deaths of over 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building by rescue workers in Turkey after being trapped for 122 hours, following the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years.
Another injured man, 55-year-old Masallah Cicek, was identified as having been rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the freezing temperatures, rescuers often pleaded for silence as they strained to hear any signs of life from the rubble of the shattered concrete.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouched under a concrete slab, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - as they carefully reached into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old newborn.
With his eyes wide open, the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warming blanket and taken to a field hospital.
Video footage showed that the paramedics also took his mother away, who was dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but conscious.
Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, with a total of 31,000 rescue workers deployed in the affected areas.
He said that approximately 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, and 1.05 million people were left homeless by the earthquake, crowding into temporary shelters.
Due to many people lacking food in the cold winter conditions, there is increasing public doubt about the leaders of the two countries' responses to disaster relief.
According to Syrian official media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly his first visit to the disaster area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme had said that its stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria were about to run out, as the state of war made relief efforts complicated.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Adiyaman province in Turkey, where he admitted that the government's response had not been as swift as expected.
Opponents seized on this issue to attack Erdogan, who is running for re-election in the vote on May 14th, but it may be postponed due to the disaster.
Reuters reported that anger over the delay in providing aid and initiating rescue efforts could potentially impact the election.
Even before the earthquake occurred, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdogan's rule in twenty years.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called "negative campaigns for political gain."
The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, criticized the government's response.
Critics said, "The earthquake was severe, but what was even more serious was the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence."

Hanoi, Vietnam News Agency - A special correspondent reports that during his visit to Brunei Darussalam, on the morning of February 11, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, also known as "University of Brunei").
The University of Brunei is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, ranking third in the local university rankings.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of educational cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei officially established a partnership with FPT University in Vietnam, with the main area of cooperation being English language training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese and Korean, the University of Brunei has also incorporated Vietnamese into its curriculum.
During his visit to the University of Brunei, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and his wife interacted with students from the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is pleased that an increasing number of foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, and is actively contributing to promoting the unique culture and customs of Vietnam to the world.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng expressed his belief and hope that the team of Vietnamese language teachers at the University of Brunei would grow stronger; more and more students in the Vietnamese language class are becoming interested in Vietnamese, studying hard, hoping to use fluent Vietnamese as soon as possible, and becoming ambassadors of friendly cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also communicated with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Da Nang city via video, understanding their learning situation, especially during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh believes that the cooperation between Vietnam's FPT University and the University of Brunei, especially the FPT-UBD Global Centre, is a vivid symbol of the educational cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
At the same time, it is hoped that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly cooperation between the two countries.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly praised the achievements in educational cooperation between the two countries during his discussions with the Minister of Education and leaders of Brunei University, including the collaboration between FPT University and Brunei University, and the initiative of incorporating Vietnamese language into the curriculum at Brunei University.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng hopes that the University of Brunei will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly praised the positive results of the cooperation between the two countries based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Educational Cooperation signed in April 2014; he suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly appreciated the establishment of the first branch of the University of Brunei in Vietnam in Southeast Asia; he believed that the university's development scale in the region and the world is increasingly strong; and further expanded the cooperative relationship with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Van Ming and his wife planted a commemorative tree on the campus of the University of Brunei and left a message in the commemorative book.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng wished for the continuous development of the University of Brunei, contributing more and more to the education of Brunei, and to carry out deeper and broader cooperation with various educational and training institutions in Vietnam.

Vietnam News Agency
Hanoi, Vietnam News Agency - Special correspondent reports that the official visit to Singapore and Brunei by Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife has been successfully completed, achieving comprehensive, pragmatic and specific results.
During his three-day visit to Singapore and Brunei, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng participated in over 30 different activities.
The achievements have injected new momentum into the continuous development of the strategic partnership between Vietnam and the new country and the comprehensive partnership with Vietnam in a deeper, broader and more effective direction.

What exactly was the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?
It's puzzling and full of speculation.
On Friday (February 10), the US military once again used its most advanced stealth jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska.
The location of the crash was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This was the second time in less than a week that the US military had shot down an airborne object.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed over the coast of South Carolina, USA, after drifting in US airspace for several days.
The Pentagon stated that the second object that was shot down first entered US airspace on Thursday night. It was tracked by the US military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet). Its size was roughly that of a small car, much smaller compared to the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.
The Pentagon also believes that there are currently no signs indicating that this object is manipulable.
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said on Friday that while the exact nature of the high-flying object was unclear, it posed a "reasonable threat to civil aviation safety."
Kobe stated that this object was different from the spy balloon found within the United States, as it did not have a "payload" attached to it.
Kobe said, "Calling it an 'object' is the best description we can make at the moment."
President Biden took the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he was "very cautious" in making this decision, Kobe added.
The official US description of the object can be roughly summarized as: the size of a small car, no control stick, no suspension device, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But this information still cannot answer basic questions, such as what exactly this object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.
Many online analyses and speculations currently suggest that this might be another Chinese balloon.
It may have originated from China, like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, carrying out some sort of mission at different locations.
Some people have linked this "object" in Alaska with "Unidentified Flying Objects" (UFOs).
A report by US Newsweek quoted a tweet from former US Congressman Peter Meijer on Friday saying, "I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."
"The irony of confusing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth sparking an interstellar conflict," said Meijer.
Meijer tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek reported that Meje was not the only one who suspected the object to be a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month and called on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release reports on "unidentified flying objects".
The customer service attitude of Amazon is hard for me to believe.
I guess not many people will read this, but I still want to say a little bit.
The clothing we bought at the time was a zip-up hoodie, but what was finally given to me was a short-sleeved shirt.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested an exchange, and the customer service said they would handle it. Then I immediately saw the product name changed to short sleeves, and the original link I bought was taken down.
Then, the customer service notified to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.
Is this how Amazon handles it?
It's really hard to believe that the wrong delivery of clothes is not my fault. As a consumer, I demand to receive the goods I should get, without making any exaggerated demands, yet Amazon changed the name and said there was no stock.
This is my first long review, I hope it's not my last.
The incomprehensible sleeve.
While it is said to be made of cowhide and is indeed quite hard, upon closer inspection, there are many small cracks in certain areas, making it unclear whether it is genuine leather. Additionally, the sleeves of this jacket are puzzling. Typically, the sleeves of a jacket are slightly longer than the hem, usually by 1-2 centimeters, but the sleeves of this jacket are a full 5 centimeters longer. When the arms are naturally hanging down, the sleeves should reach the base of the palm, but the sleeves of this jacket cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and returning them is also easy.
But when will the money be refunded?
The clothes were well made, but due to the small size, I had to return them. However, it's been over a week since I returned them and I still haven't received a refund?
Moreover, the buyer had to contact Quanfeng Express, a courier with a not-so-good reputation, on their own. This was the worst shopping experience since buying items from Amazon!
However, the store was quite good, actively cooperating to urge the courier to refund in time, but the work of this Quanfeng Express was really infuriating, dragging on for about half a month before refunding. Such a partner is going to drag Amazon down, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!
More suitable for young people.
It's a 99-second kill.
The craftsmanship, color, and feel of the woolen pants are all good, they are soft and of moderate thickness, and do not have a kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the style is slim fit, which is more suitable for young people.
3XL, with a flat waist circumference of 2.5 feet, maximum stretch size of 4 feet, is a bit tight around the waist for someone weighing 1.79/80 kilograms.
It seems there is no elastic waistband, so it's quite difficult to loosen the waist.
Additionally, wearing tight clothes is uncomfortable.
Very good, the color is not very bright.
I just bought it and it's already increased by more than two hundred, what's going on?
This was the first time Amazon used the cooperative courier service, Tian Tian Express, which was terrible. The first time they attempted delivery, I wasn't home. I then proactively arranged two delivery times with the courier, but they didn't deliver either time and eventually returned my package. This damn courier has no integrity at all. I strongly suggest not using Tian Tian Express anymore.
This time, a t-shirt was also returned to me, and if I were to buy it again, the price has increased by more than a hundred yuan.
Such products should not appear on Amazon's self-operated platform.
The product was purchased on sale, the price was not low, and the reviews also indicated that it was a very good product.
When I actually received the product, I was dumbfounded. The product had large areas of wear on the surface and multiple other areas were worn. It was either a substandard product or a used one. I will upload pictures later.
I requested a return, and the manufacturer's representative said it was due to transportation after seeing the picture. Isn't that a baseless claim?
How could the inside of a product possibly wear out?
There are only two possibilities, either the goods are substandard or old, or I deliberately damaged the goods and then returned them.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I believe such products should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Customers choose Amazon's self-operated products because they trust them. When the customer wins, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone will work together to improve. Thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year and have encountered two E2 errors, I don't know how to handle it?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the right two groups of the receiver often showed a red E2, which should be a problem with the transmitter module. This doesn't quite match what Amazon's website says about the transmitter module being able to work continuously for 7 years. I can't find after-sales service on Amazon's website, so I don't know what to do?
It's okay.
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel new.
The label on the box was torn off, and the label on the body was also broken.
And it keeps going to a white screen.
It got better after changing it.
The exchange was quite fast, it's a bit blurry at night, the field of view is not very wide, but it's enough for regular home use.
The downside is that it doesn't come with a card, I had to buy it myself, and I have previously bought a phone on Amazon.
There would usually be a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, but this time there wasn't. When buying a phone, there would also be a sticker-like seal that could be attached to the warranty card, but this time there wasn't.
I'm not sure if things are no longer available because they're cheap, it's very confusing.
Waiting for a response from the supplier.
The packaging had no markings, so I called the supplier directly. They said that the lack of markings indicated that it was genuine, and if I had doubts, I could send a sample to Johnson & Johnson for verification. They also left their license plate number and phone number, promising to send a text message to notify me that my information had been entered into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card on their official website, but I haven't received a text message yet?
Received the engine oil in the morning and replaced it in the afternoon.
The second purchase.
Amazon's self-operated products are very reliable.
The mechanic who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and indeed good quality.
Because it was the second time I made a purchase.
So it's still very reassuring.
The delivery was fast, the packaging had no faults, and after using this oil, the engine noise noticeably decreased.
The cost-performance ratio is good, it's hard to find synthetic motor oil for less than 200.
Support the star crown, support the winning card, effectively protect the car.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (delivering an 8cm caterpillar instead of an 8c caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c).
Admitting the mistake, but always evading, constantly emphasizing that the goods belong to a third party and cannot bind the third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
When I originally purchased, the size options on the page were 7c, 8, 9c. I thought this was a trap, so I called Amazon's Chinese customer service and was clearly told that 8 meant 8c. However, when the product arrived back in China, I found out it was only 8cm. I believe this was a trap deliberately set to scam Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now, this option is no longer available on the page.
Chinese customer service: We apologize for the inconvenience caused, we offer you two options:
You return the goods, the buyer bears all shipping costs.
If you don't return the item, we will compensate you with 1000 yen.
(Let me do the math, the shoes cost more than 4000 yen, which is about 200 RMB. If I choose option 1, I don't have the shoes, so the loss is 200 yuan.
I chose option 2, I have the shoes, and was finally compensated 2000 yen, with a final loss of 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded this, we will handle it seriously, and the next day they sent an email saying that if I do not accept mediation from the Chinese customer service, then it's over.
I proposed: When purchasing pages with confusing options like 7c, 8, 9c, the Chinese customer service told me that the commonly used codes in Japan do not include 'c', similar to 140, but have you guys ever looked at other caterpillar pages?
There are cases where American and Japanese codes are mixed.
Moreover, why did you place 8cm between 7c and 9c? It's clearly the smallest size, what's the point of putting it there?
Chinese Customer Service: We provide services in Chinese, but we didn't know you wanted to ship back to your country, so we will not compensate for your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic. I am Japanese, and I need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service. Tourists in Japan don't have the time to make international calls. So the question is, who needs to call Amazon's overseas Chinese service? It's probably just people like me who shop on Japanese Amazon.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just to facilitate us, the overseas online shoppers?
I am not very satisfied with this purchase.
This is the second time I've purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box when my baby was two months old, choosing diapers made from European imported paper. The first purchase experience was quite satisfactory, as my baby could use one diaper for the whole night, indeed meeting the need of not changing diapers for 12 hours.
However, this time I bought size L diapers, there were 2 separate packages in a box. After opening, I felt that the paper was looser, which was significantly different from the imported Pampers. After using them for my baby, they were okay, with no signs of leakage or rash.
However, after starting the second pack of diapers, a rash immediately appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs and has not yet faded.
I suspect that the quality of the two packages in one box is not the same.
I probably won't continue to buy in the future!
Emphasize the importance of package transportation protection.
This is the worst packaging and shipping I've seen in all my time shopping online, with absolutely no protective measures, no bubble wrap, no cushioning material, nothing at all.
Regarding a deformed box under pressure.
Moreover, the soft rubber boxes inside were packaged in such a way that the card boxes were squashed and deformed.
I hope it's genuine and the quality is guaranteed, I'm not very confident in buying things from Amazon in the future.
I'd rather pay half more domestically for some assurance.
Moreover, regarding the issue of product packaging, I saw comments from as early as 2016, and now in 2019, it's still the same.
This indicates that Amazon does not value service feedback at all, which is far behind domestic companies like JD.com and Tmall.
It's nice, but there's a slight regret.
The entire cup is in a color I really like, orange-red, even though I have a boy at home, I still think orange-red paired with yellow is very eye-catching.
It's a bit smaller than I imagined, but it's meant to be portable, so it's still acceptable.
I brought it home to try last night, and after opening the bottle cap, I found that the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw is vertically straight, my son always has to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this could be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups make the straw slanted for a reason. When it comes to children's items, safety and comfort really do matter.
Lightweight and high capacity.
I like its lightness and large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit redundant to me, as I'm not sure what to put in them.
After purchasing, I found another similar brand on the overseas shopping platform, Amazon, for less than two hundred yuan.
Fake goods, especially those that are extremely counterfeit.
I can't believe Amazon sells counterfeit goods.
The customer service said that because I used it, I couldn't return it. How would I know it was a fake if I didn't use it?
Because of trust, there is sadness. After all, it's a facial product. It's better to buy it in a physical store, even if it's a bit more expensive.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't look at the reviews. I have already submitted a complaint to the National Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's protect our rights together.
Is it broken?
Fake goods?
In short, a tragedy.
When I used the second sheet, I chose one with fine pores, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. However, when I applied it to my face, I couldn't stand it. The smell was very strong and indescribable. It made me cough immediately, and my eyes were very painful and teary. I immediately took it off and washed my face.
I tried another one of the same kind, it didn't have such a strong smell, and I'm using it now.
It reminded me a bit of the smell of cheap perm solution in a hair salon.
It's hard to imagine, will Amazon's own skincare products also have to be avoided from now on?
Unscrupulous merchant.
When I made the purchase, the promotion on the page said that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given for free with purchases over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when I received the goods. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them a screenshot of the promotion at the time. The problem is, who saves screenshots of web pages when they make purchases? You need customers to provide evidence for promotions you have run yourself. Buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.
Post-use experience.
This was my first time shopping on Amazon, and I had several impressions. Let's start with my experience after using the product. Firstly, it was indeed painless and there was no irritating smell, overall it was quite good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, the hair came off easily, although there were a few small hair residues left, which were not noticeable unless you looked closely. So overall, it was good. As for the future, I will need to continue observing and using it to know more.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second order was placed on the 27th and received on the 12th, a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery service from Amazon was also very good.
Thirdly, don't trust Amazon's Black Friday deals. I placed an order on Friday and after waiting for two days, the price dropped by nearly $12, meaning I paid over $170 (including shipping), which gives the impression that they raise prices during sales.
The customer service mentioned price fluctuations, but I've been monitoring for over 10 days and the price has been pretty stable.
Affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, granulated, definitely a repurchase!
The paste with granules in it has just the right refreshing feel. After using it, the teeth feel smooth. It's much better than some second-hand stuff, which claims to be imported, but many items don't have Chinese labels, and it's unclear where they are wholesaled from.
From now on, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand Dong again.
Here's a suggestion, sometimes I can't post reviews on the Amazon app, I hope some improvements can be made to the application, it will get better and better!
The service has been getting worse over the years, there is simply no quality to speak of!
The garbage excellence disregards customer needs when placing an order, especially the delivery time from 19:00 to 22:00.
Due to having an elderly person at home who is bedridden after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages in the evening.
Surprisingly, they delivered it directly to the door at noon without giving any prior notice by phone.
If the delivery time is at the whim of your couriers, why bother pretending to let customers choose a time?
If your own logistics can't guarantee service, then you might as well not do e-commerce at all!
Making an elderly person with three wounds get out of bed to answer the door and pay for a delivery is outrageous!
The contact number is clearly on the order!
No one bothered to call and give an explanation from start to finish!
The so-called customer service of Excellence Network is just a group of outsiders pretending to handle your complaints and then giving you a so-called response.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I had encountered similar issues with incorrect delivery times before and tolerated it, but this time it's unbearable, it's too much!
The new book I pre-ordered arrived with the front and back covers reversed. How could they overlook such an obvious quality issue and send the book to the customer like this?
Leaving a negative review will not result in anyone contacting you.
The service has been getting worse over the years, there is simply no quality to speak of!
I will not spend another penny on excellence.
The image quality is simply unacceptable.
As a title like "Ancient Atlas", the choice of images, layout, and printing in this book is really unacceptable, with some images even having mosaics, blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small format illustration, it should do justice to the grand collection of medieval literature left by our ancestors in the catalogue!
(And many images can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original files), what's the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using images at all?
I regret such an attitude towards scholarship.
In terms of text, no judgment is made, each family has its own discernment.
Overall 2 stars.
When I read this book in my second year of high school, I was just reading it out of boredom. I didn't think I would get addicted to such a book, after all, web novels from Qidian have never been that appealing to me.
And then... fell into a pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the early part when Ye Xiu is still in the online game, even the intrigue between guilds is not heavy because it is often made light-hearted by Ye's antics.
As for the competition part, it conveyed a bit of the bittersweet feeling of the changing times and the transition from old to new (perhaps I'm just sentimental).
Reading the entire book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very impressive. Some characters are just occasionally mentioned, but they also leave a deep impression. Characters like Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng, who are more focused on, have a large number of fans. Characters not at the center of the writing, such as Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu, are also very popular. In an e-sports text, it is surprising that there is not a single character that is extremely disliked. This is the success of full-time in character description.
In terms of emotional storyline, unlike the common criticism of harem and beauty or decay in general web novels, all the characters in Full-Time share a common love for the game Glory, and most of them desire a fair and square victory.
There are small amounts but no big conspiracies, everyone seems so innocent and lovely.
Perhaps this is why there are no particularly annoying characters in Full Time.
The full-time IP is also large, thanks to this.
Setting aside the cultural phenomenon of online literature, Full-Time is a pretty good book.
To some extent, he really does provide some passion and a bit of emotion to people.
This April, the full-time job will be turned into an anime.
I've wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I've always been held back by the lack of money. When I finally decided to buy it, I found that there were a lot of fakes on tb. In fact, a new version of the full-time job has recently been released, and I quite like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked at it on Amazon and bought a set all at once.
Let's briefly discuss the situation with the goods.
The fourth book does not have a plastic wrap, but the book is new.
The seventeenth book was sealed in plastic but was opened, and the texture of the book felt strange and not as hard as the others.
The 23rd book is similar to the 17th one, but it is also harder than the 17th one, and it is very old.
The publishers of a few individual books seem to be different, for example, the 23rd and 17th are from the same publisher, which is different from the others.
Overall, I'm quite satisfied. A box of 24 is quite large and very satisfying.
The Lonely Little Lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner," but there turned out to be a lot of text!
It took three readings to finish this book for the child, about a little lion who can shoot and loves to eat gummy candies.
When seeing the scene where the lion eats the hunter, there is a slight discomfort, as modern city dwellers have a hard time accepting such a scenario of being eaten by animals.
In the end, this little lion, who had succeeded in human society, lost himself. He was no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human.
In the end, only the little lion's silhouette was left, and it was unknown where he had gone.
Perhaps years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the impressions of grown-up children, being recalled inadvertently one day, and may touch or inspire them.
A very cost-effective portfolio.
I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I've bought quite a few of their books because they are so impressive, both in terms of the topics they choose and the production itself.
There have been three versions of this work, the largest of which is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, similar to the complete works of Michelangelo; the medium version is approximately 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and comes with a two-volume book box.
Personally, I find it acceptable. Firstly, it's affordable and the 700-plus pages are divided into two volumes, making it easier to flip through as a paperback. Secondly, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, this book of Da Vinci is predominantly filled with black and white manuscripts. For readers with a limited budget and non-art majors, this edition offers the highest cost-performance ratio for appreciating artworks and manuscripts.
The commentary on the painting section is excellent, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper), but due to either printing or book size issues, some shadow parts are too dark to see the details, which is a bit regrettable.
Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts are much more abundant in content.
The former is already a genius, the latter's wide range of interests and high achievements are not enough to describe as a genius.
If before one could only appreciate half of Da Vinci through his paintings, after seeing his manuscripts, one would be completely speechless.
Trash, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give bad reviews, but this is genuinely rubbish. It's a waste of money. Give me a reason!
The time was not accurate, it suddenly turned to January 1st, and the time was reset to zero.
Inferior quality belts, which are not made of silicone, can cause allergic reactions and blisters on the wrist.
3. Often unable to connect to the mobile phone.
The battery life is only five days.
Sleep detection does not display, the time is 0.
Not waterproof.
7. Others.
The logistics are too slow.
It was supposed to arrive on October 16th, but I only received it on the 21st. Bad review!
The delivery is too bad, buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfaction.
Initially, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was fine. There was an airbag inside, the camera's three codes matched, and it could be registered on the official website. The shutter count was zero, and the rest would have to be tested over time.
The delivery speed was quite fast, but I have to complain about the courier. He left the valuable item at the door and left quickly. I had no chance to open the box and check it in front of him, which left me speechless.
The merchant has considered the customer's needs before shipping :)
The merchant was quite responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, truly considering the customer's needs.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The diamond film fits quite well and is effective.
The battery is not fully charged.
The machine is indeed good, but I want to ask why it can't be fully charged the first time, the charging indicator light is always red.
Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so feedback can only be given in product reviews.
On March 29, I pre-ordered this book for 31 yuan, which showed it would be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book could not be previewed on the Amazon official website (because it had not yet been released).
The book pushed to the device on March 31st was blank, with only a "coming soon" message, and the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan.
I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank books downloaded on the device and sync again over the past two days, but I have been unable to obtain the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" containing actual content. However, I see that the book can already be previewed on the Amazon official website.
Currently, I have a few thoughts.
The issue of price is not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books of actual content, rather than always downloading "coming soon".
I probably won't buy pre-ordered books in the future, after all, if it gets postponed, downloading an empty book seems very complicated.
I hope Amazon can provide a proper channel for feedback on such issues, so that there is a place to voice concerns when there are doubts about e-book downloads or usage (tickets, online customer service, etc. can be used, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does it).
Not highly recommended for reading.
I read it a long time ago, and just happened to see it. I'll write some thoughts from memory.
This book is less a collection of short stories, and more a collection of fragments about love from life.
The tone of this book is extremely plain, like that of plain water, with the pursuit of simplicity in word choice and sentence construction taken to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street on a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small moment in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally collected together, it was titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."
I think, this collection of stories, as well as its title, is like a kind of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the joys and sorrows on the stage, the eternal love in urban legends, or the inseparable intimacy between lovers. Love is not only the above and should not be represented by the above. Love is also a life as plain as water, a boring day after day, as well as the helplessness towards life, the escape from reality, and the confusion about the future.
While reading this book, you may recall the quarrelling couple beside you, the bland marriages of people you know, and unsatisfactory relationships.
This is exactly why I do not recommend reading it. From an aesthetic perspective, the writing and plot of this book are bland and tasteless, unless your life is tumultuous or sweet as living in a candy castle, otherwise, your feeling when reading it would be indifferent and bored.
From a depth of thought perspective, the everyday plot does not dazzle or expand one's thinking and perspective (unlike Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much difference whether you read it or not.
The author's ideas are more expressed through techniques and genres rather than the story plot, which is a reason why the reading experience of this book is relatively poor.
Suitable for skimming, not for detailed reading.
The logic of this book is good, but the content is not rich enough.
Many sales theories explain what and why, but are weak in terms of how to do it, only pointing out the direction but not providing specific methods.
Additionally, this book feels like it was pieced together.
Examples include both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and those who are not well-known.
It is unclear whether the stories were compiled for illustrative purposes, but examples from the author's personal experience would be more convincing.
The terminology fluctuates between "customer" and "client".
The title still refers to the customer, but in the body of the text, it has changed to client.
The e-book also had issues with typos, missing punctuation, and numbering errors.
In summary, this book is a good choice for beginners in theory, but not quite suitable for those already in sales who want to improve their sales level.
A guidebook for quickly understanding internet finance.
This book is quite basic, it can be said to be an introductory course, it can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of internet finance, but to understand in depth, you still need to follow the clues and dig deeper on your own.
Moreover, the book was written quite early, and it does not mention the later subsidy wars between Alipay and WeChat to cultivate user habits. The current market share of third-party payments is probably much larger than what is mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people just bring their mobile phones when they go out to eat, and because of the high bank turnover, merchants have abandoned UnionPay.
Still, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is clear that the author has many years of experience observing finance and is very familiar with the history of financial development both domestically and abroad, which is why he was able to write such accessible content.
It's easy to write grandiloquently, the challenge is to write in a way that's easy to understand.
I admire you, and I want you to know it!
The primary factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough recognition and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, once a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for most Chinese people, love is often "kept in the heart and hard to express," even feelings of love, gratitude, and appreciation are silently kept in the heart and not spoken out loud.
The author elaborates on five languages of appreciation in this book: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, receiving gifts, and physical touch.
I think what's important is not knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to genuinely use these five languages to appreciate and be grateful for the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer the person, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, which will make our lives better.
By learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thanks to the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and world views.
Due to differences in cultural backgrounds between the East and the West, there are more or less differences between languages. If there is a chance to see the original version of the author, I believe more will be gained.
Once again, thank you to the authors, translators, and editors for their hard work!
Suspected counterfeit product, please conduct strict review, Amazon.
The quality is extremely poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it's even worse than roadside stall products, there is no weight, no barcode, the ten-bag packaging is also loose, it's not at all the characteristics of a qualified product; it's the worst shopping experience on Amazon, I have already applied for a return; it's completely a quality issue; I suggest the seller to open their eyes and reject inferior goods; supplement: I bought another Heart to Heart, supermarket 23 yuan/10 rolls, added a few comparison photos, further verified the inferiority of this product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further unpleasant feelings!
Once again, there is an expectation for Amazon to be meticulous and strictly control the source of its products.
The product is mediocre and does not meet expectations.
Advantages:
Big brand, low price.
Advantage 2: Both the motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are okay to use, but there is a gap between the actual performance and my expectations.
Disadvantages:
There is no charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. I guess for customers who buy a 300 yuan product, in the eyes of Panasonic, it is a handout, with no respect at all.
There is a strong unpleasant smell when charging, even if it's only for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong scent of burning plastic.
After a day of testing in the office, the whole room was filled with the smell of plastic.
Compared to the Philips product of the same price range that I used before, although this Panasonic product has an extra blade, the quality really lets consumers down.
Small package
Upon receiving the package and seeing "e-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It was much smaller than what I bought from the supermarket, probably a size M. The packaging didn't match the product description and images, probably a so-called new version.
Three stars is blaming myself for not carefully checking the product specifications. I have no objection to you selling M size e-commerce version, but what do you mean by delivering the wrong version?
E-commerce can be tricky, it's better to go to the supermarket if you have time.
Just like that.
Don't like the taste.
The child really dislikes the taste of toothpaste, always saying it's spicy. Perhaps a different word would be more appropriate, but for now, this is the only word in the child's vocabulary.
I bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving a bad review. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Authentic product, well packaged.
The packaging was complete, with an airbag added inside, not just the bare product as some online reviews suggested.
The bottle also has a layer of plastic wrap on the outside packaging as described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the day after the order was placed.
It is genuine, just out of stock, not sure when it will be restocked.
A terrible shopping experience.
I placed an order during Black Friday, but after waiting for a long time, I didn't receive it. Upon checking, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues and none of them had signed for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, it was clear that the package had been mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transfers, I finally retrieved the package. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was still intact. I don't know if it has been used or not. It was quite a frustrating experience.
Incorrect illustration.
I thought I would receive headphones like the ones in picture 1, but instead I received headphones like those in picture 2. Not only do the items not match the pictures, but what does it mean when the sound in the left and right earpieces is not the same?
Although the names are the same, we hope everyone will be careful and we also ask the person in charge at Amazon to replace the correct pictures in a timely manner. Thank you very much.
The operating system is average.
After using it for a while, the overall display is acceptable, and there doesn't seem to be much difference. However, the system is somewhat frustrating to use, the boot time is noticeably slow, and it's not easy to set up. The pre-installed software doesn't even warrant a comment, and the response speed is just average. Compared to my colleague's, it's not even in the same league.
I read reviews saying the design is very user-friendly, but I couldn't find where it was user-friendly. The placement of the commonly used up, down, left, right, and back buttons on the remote control is really not commendable.
So, just use it as a TV, and add things like a TV box.
The price drop is too drastic.
The price drop is too drastic, from over a hundred to now 99!
I have accumulated many unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the review content for all of them.
If I use this statement to evaluate, it means that the product scores at least 85 points or above.
For inferior products, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews. This would serve as a reference for other consumers when making purchases, and the merchants would also improve the quality of their products as a result.
A good, affordable cable, this is enough if you're not an audiophile!
Such a cheap cable, but it should have met the HDMI certification standards. After personal comparison, it easily beats these crappy things from Akihabara in China (the price is twice as expensive). The cable is thick and relatively soft, there is no noise in 7 meters transmission, in the future, I will only choose Beisi for low-cost cables!
The products are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, I realized I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order. The link to contact customer service on the website kept showing an error, so I couldn't get in touch.
After the delivery arrived, the courier called me. I told him I didn't want it and had tried to cancel the order unsuccessfully. The courier took it back, saying he would sign for it first and advised me to apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they have been signed for. I tried calling Amazon customer service, but they said the same thing, that items cannot be returned once they have been signed for.
I have previously bought items that are non-refundable due to policy, including milk and diapers, from Jingdong and Suning. The customer service was able to process the returns for me, even when the diapers from Jingdong had a strong smell after opening. However, this was not possible with Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, how do your customer service handle this?
They told me to either accept it myself or let the delivery person buy it. The delivery person already has a hard job, why should they have to pay for something they didn't purchase?
Fine, I won't return it, I'll keep it for myself, but I must give your service a score of 1.
I advise everyone not to waste money.
I bought it with high expectations, thinking that the Doule brand wouldn't be too bad. After receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay and the size was decent. However, one box was mostly soft, which you couldn't tell from the outside, you had to feel it. It had no taste when eaten, bland and tasteless. When bitten into, the fruit flesh was a dark yellow, the kind that indicates it's spoiled. Good and bad ones were mixed together, and less than a third were edible. I advise everyone not to buy it. It's not cheap and the quality is too poor!
Once bitten, twice shy; I will never buy fruit from e-commerce again!
Where is the product's anti-counterfeit label?
The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which must have been caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is distressing, especially since it is food packaging and it is too simple, and it is also an international purchase. Moreover, there is no obvious anti-counterfeit identification mark. Opening the bottle is very easy, and the key is that a layer of honey inside the cap directly came out from inside, there is almost no adhesion when opened, is this how all foreign products are?
As someone born in China, I'm a bit confused.
It should be genuine, right?
Also, when I placed the order, it indicated that it would arrive in the twenties, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe this is all normal?
The pick-up service needs improvement.
I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that one was missed and promised to be sent later. The second appointment happened to be on a day off, and there was no prompt on the website or WeChat that an appointment needed to be made on a working day, causing unnecessary panic. I suggest improvements for the future.
Good shopping.
Good reviews all around!
I tend to trust products sold directly by Amazon. Now, overseas shopping is very convenient. The logistics time for buying from abroad is only a few days longer than domestic. It must be said that Amazon's ability to clear customs from overseas to domestic is very strong, much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought on overseas shopping.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic products can be improved. Many things are produced domestically, but buying them after a trip abroad is cheaper than buying them at home. I hope for improvements.
Trash
Looking at such a package, I ask everyone: doesn't it look like roadside trash?
Is it responsible to send a fragile plastic package in a plastic bag from so-called Germany?
I see this packaging as if it's for garbage. The product was purchased with extremely shoddy packaging, with no measures to prevent damage. It was simply wrapped in a plastic bag. Upon receipt, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were damaged.
If I had just encountered one like this, I would have accepted it, but I bought several like this. I contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return it, but I had to pay for the shipping upfront, and then the shipping cost would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I have a question, if I pay the shipping fee in cash, and you give me a gift card in return, are you asking me to buy your gift cards? And I have to send the product to the warehouse in Germany myself, isn't this making purchasing a product a hassle!
I kept asking the customer service who was responsible for this issue, but they didn't admit it was their fault, not even a word of responsibility. What kind of guarantee does such after-sales service provide? In one word: admit defeat! But I guess Amazon won't even give me the chance to publish this review, they'll just delete it!
The quality is very good, 5 stars, but the logistics are very poor.
The quality is very good, it's a steal, the price is reasonable, and it's worth more than it costs.
The product is sturdy, made with sufficient materials, has solid welding points, appropriate surface treatment, and good color.
The logistics are a major issue; orders placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.
I might have been very satisfied if Amazon hadn't marked the estimated arrival date as February 7th.
However, marking an expected arrival time is like making a promise to the user, and it's hard for the user to accept when that promise can't be fulfilled.
If you are not sure you can keep a promise, please do not make one.
In fact, I care very much about the promises made by businesses.
So, I gave it a low score.
The gold thread will fade in color.
The effects are there, but whether they are noticeable depends on the individual, or it could be a placebo effect.
One downside is the golden thread, which was originally designed for aesthetics, but in reality, this gold thread fades. If it is placed in the car and moved a few times, there will be some gold dust on the hands and in the car.
The product is hoped to be improved.
This square one, which doesn't have much decorative effect, shouldn't have gold lines added to it. If they fall off and dirty the car, it would be troublesome.
The items are intact, the speed is acceptable, and they are divided into two packages with different packaging.
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but the two items were split into two packages, and the packaging was not the same. One was obviously over-protected, with thick cardboard attached and a layer of plastic sealed, and the outer packaging was also easy to unpack. The other one was like a domestic express box, with a few air cushions considered done, which felt a bit perfunctory.
The Eran mattress is genuinely good.
A 34cm mattress is not typically thick, you could even sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is very good, both the front and the back are quite soft, sleeping is very comfortable, and you fall asleep quickly when lying on it.
Upon receiving the mattress, there were two stains due to rough handling during delivery. The Yalan customer service was very responsible and efficiently resolved the issue.
It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly indicates that it is self-operated, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, the after-sales service is the responsibility of the supplier, and if there are any problems, you need to contact the supplier directly.
If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has already been passed to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you want to return or exchange goods, even if you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one will pay attention to you, you need to contact the supplier for returns yourself.
What the hell kind of self-operated merchandise is this?
The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier," and claimed that it is self-operated. This is too shameless, blatantly faceless, and blatantly defrauding consumers!
The experience of depression.
The filter cartridge I previously bought online from another store had a good filtering effect, and even after 28 days, there was no scale even if it was used for an extra day or two.
Having always been satisfied with the quality of items purchased from Amazon, I decided to buy a filter cartridge there for the first time. However, the experience was not very good. Not only did limescale start to appear early on, but small black carbon particles were still suspended in the water on the 28th day of using the filter cartridge. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. It's very frustrating.
It's not as good as imagined.
Compared to the power strips I've used in the past, the external workmanship is average, I haven't opened it to see the inside, but I hope it's as the seller described. From the perspective of ease of use, there is a lack of display to show whether each independent unit is powered.
The packaging is damaged, we will have to wait for time to test the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, the inner box seems to be new, but the instruction manual doesn't seem to be new. I just renovated in September and am stocking up, I hope it won't be broken by then. Amazon, please explain why several customers mentioned damaged packaging, yet you seem to be okay with it. Thank you!
Overall good, with a few minor issues.
This was my first time buying a water filter jug. After reading several reviews, I felt that LAICA offered better value for money, so I chose this one. After receiving the product and installing the filter according to the instructions, I found it generally satisfactory. However, it seems that the unfiltered water might mix with the filtered water when pouring, as the seal on the raw water compartment doesn't seem very tight.
When using, make sure all the water is filtered before pouring it out!
The image is incomplete.
The photo did not capture the details of the side, which are not consistent with the main style and differ greatly, that's one; the bead is produced in Thailand, but the place of origin is not marked, that's two; the texture is not marked, that's three; when I bought it in the UK, each item had its own box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo on the bead, how can I judge whether it is real or fake.
Be careful when making purchases, especially when buying items from Hong Kong.
Amazon's customer service is really terrible.
I placed an order two days ago and found out today that the price had dropped by 40 yuan. I spent a lot of time contacting customer service, who said they couldn't refund the difference, but I could repurchase and return the original item.
This customer experience and service is ten thousand times worse than that of certain online shopping platforms.
Not bad, worth getting for a beginner.
The quality is passable, but it can't compare to the top-notch Transformers. I've seen the price in the mall before, it's at least several hundred. This is my first time playing with Transformers, it's okay.
The stuff is not bad.
The product is really good, a gift for my girlfriend, but I had some unpleasant experience with the delivery at noon when I was not in Canada. The logistics company directly put it in the mail storage box and did not send me a verification message for pick-up, causing me to make two trips.
But the baby is indeed good.
Worth buying.
The little monkey is cute, Amazon offers great discounts, Chow Sang Sang's official website ships directly. I placed an order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon. That's really fast.
The postal courier is also very responsible.
Great!
A customer's confession.
Upon receiving such a defective product, Amazon customer service told you not to worry, they would contact you in about 54 hours.
Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that a specialist will handle this issue and inform you of the result.
You can never actively contact this officer, nor do you know her employee number, nor do you have a direct contact number. You simply cannot reach her; she can only contact you.
Sadly, after waiting for nearly three days, the representative contacted me, but I missed the call as I was away from my phone for a while.
I waited for 2 hours but did not receive a call from the commissioner. During this time, I proactively contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email asking them to call me back.
Nearly three days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon's response will be to the defective coffee machine I received!
The products from Amazon US are fine, overseas shopping is a good method, but the service is far inferior compared to Amazon US.
For me, all I can do is continue to wait...
Uneven bottom.
Because the reviews were all very good, I had high expectations for this pot. I was very pleased when I received it because it was lightweight. However, I encountered a problem when I started to use it. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it bulges in the middle and dips around the edges, causing all the oil to run to the sides. The large piece of fatty meat I specifically bought to season the pot produced a lot of oil, but it couldn't cover the central area and got burnt. I couldn't even season the pot properly, and I doubt I can cook normally with this design.
I don't know if I was just unlucky, but I happened to get a pan with an uneven base. Thankfully, Amazon offers a one-month return service, so I promptly returned it.
I scrubbed the pot clean and returned it, having wasted half a day for nothing.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve.
This is a product with a very simple design style.
The cube shape, the designer treated the top into a slight curve.
The lines should have been very smooth.
Unfortunately, the final result could not be achieved.
Because there are two components at the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the water tank cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the control panel were not consistent, resulting in a height difference of about 2mm after assembly.
Although it appears to be a small gap.
But it can be said that it destroyed the entire sense of design.
I feel a bit sorry for that product designer.
It seems that Midea's product manager does not yet have the ability to create a product of this standard.
(Of course, one cannot expect too much from the feedback of the after-sales lady, but when I heard her say that all units of this product are like this, not just the one I bought, her indifference and heavy burden of truth made me realize that I can't expect too much from beauty either) On July 7, 2019, the pump failed and the water output was low, it was the second repair, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
It's a great deal after the discount, but Amazon's fake discounts are very disappointing.
Purchased one week after the baby's birth, it has excellent insulation.
The outside of the pot does not feel hot to the touch, ensuring it won't burn anyone and effectively preventing heat from escaping.
After a night, the air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon claimed a big discount for their anniversary event at 320, but later everyone found out that there were also discounts at 249, 289, and 299, which instantly gave a feeling of being deceived. However, after comparing with the supermarket, it was still much more cost-effective than various off-brands at the same price. It can be carried with the car when going out in the future.
Vitamix 6300
After waiting for a long time, I saw that the price of the product on Amazon was reduced to 6300, and the same price was offered on Amazon's overseas purchase, so I quickly made a purchase.
I placed the order on September 2nd, expecting it to arrive on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days early. The speed was really fast!
The packaging box is not big, it directly uses Vitamix's original packaging, Amazon is not afraid of it being damaged across the ocean!
The machine looks quite new and comes with all the accessories, but the cup shakes terribly when placed on the base. I'm afraid to turn it on in case the cup flies off!
I asked a friend who has 5200 friends, and from his description, it seems like mine is not as loose as his.
The randomly included recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I couldn't find a Chinese version online, which is a hassle!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer. I guess it will arrive in about 3 days, and then I can tinker with it properly!
It's too small, doesn't have an umbrella cover, and the material is average.
It's not a large size at all!
The second Totes umbrella, 1. This one doesn't come with a cover 2. The handle material is average 3. Despite being labeled as Large, it's actually a convenient umbrella for one person, it would probably be a squeeze for two people.
On the contrary, the one previously bought from Amazon can be used by three people without any pressure.
I'm not feeling very well.
Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms with a little pressure, secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS surface of the box from being scratched when placed flat, thirdly, inside the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around, the place where the pull rod protrudes... and so on, all kinds of dissatisfaction, finally, the zipper is a bit unsmooth.
PS: The wheels do indeed feel quite good.
It's okay.
Advantage: This backpack is quite delicate and appears to be durable.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what's going on?), a 15.6-inch laptop does not fit (can it be a bit longer?), this backpack's zipper can be locked, but no lock is provided for the buyer, which can hardly be called top-notch service.
Overall it's okay, not sure if it's real leather.
Overall, it feels okay, I can't tell if it's real leather, so I can't make a blind judgement.
It can hold A4 size documents, up to 80 pages thick, but it probably can't hold a box-shaped object that's too thick or hard (non-deformable).
The bag is very soft, and the interior compartments are quite user-friendly, which is pretty good.
I just received this and there's a small sand hole at the bottom, I don't know if it's because of my bad luck or what?
I couldn't be bothered to go through the hassle of returning and exchanging the item, so I put up with it.
Overall, it's worth four stars.
ForRoyal's globally popular camera strap, DSLR strap.
This strap is designed scientifically, it is practical to hang on both shoulders, and the front is fixed and protected by soft material, unlike other quick shooters that use screws to fix the bottom and damage the camera, and it is also convenient to take off the camera.
Poor after-sales service.
I bought a piano a month and a half ago that was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me the after-sales service number. Despite multiple communications, I still haven't received the part. What kind of efficiency is this!
If you anticipate problems with repairs later on, it's more troublesome. Friends who expect good after-sales service should take a detour, it's too much trouble!
There are minor flaws, but the tone is good.
The head of the piano has a defect, missing a corner, it feels like a substandard product, and there are no gifts, but the price is already good, and the sound of the piano is also good.
It's okay, the first delivery slip.
After using it for a long time, apart from the bass not coming out, overall it's not bad.
The workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the item, all the lights were flashing and it was unusable.
I requested for an exchange, but even after the goods arrived in Shanghai three days ago, they still haven't been delivered.
The delivery person is not answering the phone calls.
The courier company said that was the only contact information they had.
Amazon could not find a place to lodge a complaint.
Without any request, a text message came saying that the delivery was delayed as per my request - in a case where the delivery was delayed for no apparent reason.
Then there was some discussion about a transfer issue.
The extremely poor shopping experience has led to doubts about the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
It's estimated that it won't be obtained today.
The label adhesive is too weak and not waterproof.
Although Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not laminated; moreover, the label's adhesion is poor, making it unsuitable for cable labels as they can easily fall off. Friends who buy it for cable management need to be aware of this.
The pen is fine, but the packaging was too simple, just a cardboard box, with no protective measures. Moreover, the box for the pen was stuck with a large piece of transparent tape, and when torn off, the glue remained on the box.
I'm very disappointed with this purchase, considering it cost six hundred yuan.
But the pen is fine.
I hope for more improvements in the packaging in the future!
The quality is unquestionable, but in terms of writing, it's not as good as 925-25.
Let's first praise Tiantian Express, their air freight is super fast and their service attitude is also very good!
I've been using the 925-25, which is great. I just received the 925-85, the quality of the pen is unquestionable and the style is very beautiful. The reason I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, and the cap adjustment for the lead length is a bit shaky. Personal opinion: the 925-25 is more handy than the 85.
Therefore, became a die-hard fan of Amazon.
I bought it at a super discount price, but my child didn't like the reading pen.
It has been unsealed, tried to apply for a return, and they actually picked it up from my home for free.
That's awesome.
Returns are not encouraged, but this kind of service is unique in China.
I hope it will not be abused.
From then on, all books were bought from this place.
Headphone bias, and noise.
These headphones are really terrible, I don't know if it's my ears that have a problem or if these headphones are indeed not as good as they used to be.
I bought a blue one from a certain easy purchase two years ago, the sound quality was pretty good with no noise and decent bass. After using it for more than two years and it broke, I plan to buy another one (urbeats), as I feel it was quite good.
I saw a pretty good-looking purple one and bought it. But when I opened it today and listened to it, I realized something was wrong - one side was louder than the other.
At first, I thought it was due to the sound effects of the song and didn't think much of it, but after listening for a while, I realized that the problem was serious. Not only was the sound off, but the bass effect was not as good as before, and there was some noise. Is it just the purple one I bought that has this problem? Or is the current headphone manufacturing process really not up to par?
Quite a poor review, very disappointing.
You must return the goods during the day tomorrow.
The PS has a good appearance.
This AV amplifier is complex to set up, has a rough exterior, and generates a lot of heat.
Give the sound some time before judging!
Just got the German version of the DN1080 on August 14th. The exterior workmanship is so poor.
The front panel and knobs are all made of plastic.
The audio input jack on the back panel and the speaker output terminals are so poor, any 1000-2000 CD amplifier integrated machine you pick at random would be much better than this model.
The top cover is quite thin, and it even caved in on the side of my transformer, forcing me to open the box and manually restore it. The combination of the top cover and the front panel is loose.
The entire machine is top-heavy towards the transformer end, making it awkward to move.
The product feels like an entry-level device from SONY, with that kind of craftsmanship, made in Malaysia.
It feels like Sony's decision to outsource in China is much better than Pony's.
The machine heats up significantly, after about two hours of watching a movie with two channels, the top cover feels about 40-50℃ to the touch. I'm not sure if it's because the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switch power supplies are commonly used, and this big, dumb transformer probably weighs about 4KG.
Sony should have used an active cooling silent fan inside the machine, but upon opening the box, only a large aluminum heat sink on the pipe was seen.

Never been opened.
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what's inside its stomach.
Later on, I thought, if I was disappointed after opening it, it would be a waste of money; if I was satisfied after opening it, it would be difficult to put it back together, and I wouldn't be happy using it.
Well, let's just assume that Sony uses good battery cells.
As for the detailed explanation of electricity, it generally makes people feel uneasy.
I'm doing well, having worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I can be considered half a battery engineer, and I can hold my own.
Overjoyed.
I really had no idea before buying, but as soon as I opened it and saw the packaging, I felt reassured!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cord, it felt particularly flexible and of high quality. I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was astonished, the sound quality was actually 3D surround!
I asked in a physical communication store, it's about 30 for a similar one, but definitely not the Pisen brand, it's a miscellaneous brand. Therefore, although this Pisen is 27, it's definitely worth having for its cost performance!
The worst online shopping experience.
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but I still hadn't received the goods by October 12.
When checking the Amazon order status, the seller did not provide a tracking number, so it's impossible to locate the order.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide a tracking number, but there was no response after two days.
Out of desperation, I contacted Amazon's customer service, who gave me the seller's phone number. After calling the store a few times, I finally got through and was informed that the package had been lost. They offered to immediately send me a replacement.
Although I was particularly angry, I didn't say much to the seller because of the urgent need for the computer, as long as it was sent to me immediately.
As a result, I called the next day to ask, has it been shipped?
The seller said it hasn't been sent yet, it will be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller assured me that the item would be shipped after five or six in the evening. However, when I called at seven in the evening, no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again, asking if the goods had been shipped out?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said it hasn't been shipped yet, and told me to order from another store if I'm in a hurry, but if I can wait, it will be shipped in the afternoon.
There's no choice, ordering from another place would take a long time.
All we can do is ask the seller to ship the goods as soon as possible.
Finally, after countless phone follow-ups, I received the computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know because it was purchased for someone else. I will add more comments later.
I just bought it half a year ago and haven't used it much, but it's already having contact issues. Can I ask for it to be repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I didn't use it much after buying it.
Just bring it in your travel bag to use a few times.
Recently, it was found that when the power is connected, it does not charge. It is necessary to manually adjust the connection between the charger and the wire a few times before it can be charged.
I suspect there is a poor contact at the interface, I wonder if it can still be repaired now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon stop using EMS!
Five stars for the product, one star for logistics, averaging three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon would choose to ship with EMS, which is widely recognized in the industry as unreliable. After all, a computer is a valuable item!
The post-purchase order indicated an expected delivery on the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four to five days to send something from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
On the morning of the 22nd, the logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, and I was ready to happily receive the goods. However, in the evening, without receiving any calls or messages, I checked the logistics and found that it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I had signed for it!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I'm seriously questioning my life!
Finally, I had to make a trip to the collection point to bring the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier mixed up the two tracking numbers, but fortunately, the package was not lost.
I strongly suggest that Amazon stop using EMS. If Amazon continues to use EMS for delivery, I will definitely not purchase from them again.
The goods are not bad.
Firstly, I just bought it a few days ago and found out it had been reduced in price, which is disappointing. The laptop itself is quite good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games. The cooling is very good, but the screen has a bit of light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not good (I suggest spending some money to add a solid state drive). I took it to after-sales for a hardware check yesterday, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Windows 8.1 is not very user-friendly, I suggest upgrading to Windows 10. The seller shipped quickly and answered all inquiries quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer, which is good, but unfortunately there were no gifts.
(By the way, when buying keyboard film, definitely do not go to a Taobao store called E Cool Digital Center. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and they do not accept returns or exchanges for faulty products. The owner also uses foul language. Just a special mention.)
The goods are excellent, but the platform bureaucracy remains.
The hard drive is of excellent quality and absolutely high cost-performance ratio, even cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I would definitely recommend purchasing it.
However, it must be said that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains unchanged from a few years ago when I swore I would never use it again. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information is always delivered a few weeks later, you can never complain, it's just so bureaucratic!
The goods have been received for a few days, but the logistics information still says you will receive the goods in about ten days!
Logistics is a headache.
It arrived in this condition, not only was the packaging crushed, the appliance packaging was also open, I don't even know if anything was switched.
For Your Information.
I haven't tried it yet, but I always trust Philips and hope that the battery life is longer than other brands.
I looked it up online, it might be a common problem with water ingress, and there's no warranty.
Depressed!
Now that it's wrapped in cling film and continues to be used, I wonder how long it can last?
Bought something that has been opened by someone else.
The tax of over a hundred on more than three hundred machines is indeed high, but seeing it now at over six hundred makes me feel much more balanced.
When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened. I quickly took a picture, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening it, the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I hurriedly tried it on my husband before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no power at all, but luckily there were no stubble in the blade, otherwise how would I return it from such a distance!
Whether it's good to use or if there will be any short-term problems is still unknown, as the previous review stated, the items sent out when out of stock are indeed unreliable!
Above average in terms of experience.
It's almost top-of-the-line electric, with many different tooth cleaning modes, but few people would change modes every day.
I've been using it for half a year without any problems, brushing every day, and it needs to be charged about once a week.
The brush head attachments are just as cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, apart from changing the colors and such, it seems that other compatibility issues are due to the overseas version?
I want to learn the Great Law.
High cost-performance ratio.
It has already been used 3-4 times.
The packaging is intact.
It is very easy to use and also convenient to clean.
You can totally DIY your haircut and save money.
In conclusion, it was a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeits.
Last time I bought two packs, they turned out to be two different versions. Originally, the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but one pack was not, it had white words. As a result, the cat had diarrhea after eating it.
I can't confirm whether the goods from Amazon are fake, or if they were switched by the staff during delivery.
I will buy it again, and if it's still counterfeit, I will hold your relevant personnel accountable.
It's a hyphen!
The picture on Amazon showed a slash, but what they sent me was a dash, isn't this a scam?
The effect is okay.
The cat likes to eat, that's the point.
Indeed, it is effective.
Tight, narrow, binding feet, rubbing the top of the foot.
Not recommended.
UN is the most comfortable series from Clarks, but unfortunately, this model is too poor.
Addendum: Today I compared the insoles of the previous UN series shoes (the shoes were thrown away but the insoles were kept for use), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it's just falsely soft.
The arch of my foot is not very high, and the part that gets rubbed is about 3 centimeters forward from the highest point of the arch.
I bought three pairs of Clarks from overseas, but only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the games from my favorites.
Try Rockport again, if it doesn't work, the only option is to go to the ECCO physical store.
Subpar filling, poor quality control.
Firstly, it's worth acknowledging that Prime's overseas purchase Ups is very efficient, orders placed on the 31st were received by the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than in the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a bit larger, with a foot length of 25 and a width of 10.5, the 7.5W is a bit loose when worn, but I usually like to wear it a bit loose, and it fits just right with a pair of insoles.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. One shoe has a damaged sole, the other has various scratches and a pinhole on the surface, and the glue strip at the connection between the shoe surface and the sole is misplaced. It's clearly a case of substituting inferior products for good ones!
A bit of regret!
I bought it for 280 yuan during a promotion, which is quite a good deal for Asics. Of course, according to the reviews, there are even lower prices.
Now about the shoes, the advantages: the shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well, they are not loose.
The shoes are very attractive but the drawbacks are also obvious: I usually wear size 40, but this time I bought 40.5, and there is about a thumb's width of space at the front of the shoe. However, this does not affect anything.
The shoe is very "narrow," although there is still space in the front, it feels tight.
Another point is that the shoes may not be very breathable, as my feet feel very hot when wearing them now.
Pressing the top of the foot.
Firstly, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are quite standard, with running shoes at UK7.5, EU41.5, and leather shoes at UK6.5. I've bought several pairs from Amazon's Aibu, and they've always fit well. However, for this pair, I bought a size larger (UK7) based on the reviews. The shoes were noticeably too long because they were a size too big, but because the insoles were too thick, they still pressed hard on the top of my foot. Combined with the hardness of the walking shoes, they were very uncomfortable to wear.
If your feet are not particularly slim, this model is not recommended.
If you must buy, changing the insole can solve the problem, but the original insole looks very high-end, it's a pity not to use it.
A perfect shopping experience!
Very satisfied, very fond of, Amazon overseas purchases are undoubtedly genuine, the quality is also very good, good value for money, rest assured to buy, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and amiable, dealing with problems patiently and efficiently, perfectly solving the worries, the matching express delivery to the door is very convenient and reliable, the delivery master is very considerate for customers, will always remind to pick up from the express cabinet in time, thank Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In conclusion, our whole family loves shopping on Amazon overseas!
Absolutely terrible!
I'm really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Even though it's been a long time, I still need to vent.
Bought it in a winter flash sale for less than 200, it has been sitting at home unused for several months.
In spring, it was found that it could not connect with the bracelet no matter what, both devices' manuals indicated support for each other, it was later discovered that the problem should be with the heart rate band, as it still couldn't connect with other devices.
I called Amazon, and they told me to contact the agency, which asked me to send the device to Shanghai for inspection at my own expense.
Almost half a month later, the items were returned exactly as they were sent, even the courier box was the one I used to send them!
There are no replies, receipts, or inspection reports!
At least tell me whether it's good or bad!
I called to ask, and they said that sending it back like this indicates that the device is fine, it's good.
But why can't I still connect, the proxy company replied: that's not their problem.
Consider me unlucky, I can't be bothered to be hassled over a 200-dollar item.
Serious mismatch of goods.
It's completely inappropriate.
The material of the headband is very good.
Much better than Nike.
It is also very breathable.
Just the hat in front.
Very thin.
Are you here to joke around?!
It completely fails to block the sunlight.
The reason for not returning it is because it functions well as a headband.
Wearing it upwards doesn't provide much protection from the sun.
But it's different from other headband styles.
Save it for later use.
The product quality is good, but Amazon lacks a spirit of contract, the delivery person is very good.
I request delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon's policy does not allow for deliveries on Saturdays and Sundays.
I had to drive 200 kilometers back from out of town to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person was very proactive and enthusiastic.
Give a thumbs up!
The product, after a simple trial, is not bad.
But I've never bought similar products before, so I can't compare prices!
Size logistics
The workmanship is acceptable, but the logistics are too slow. Previous shoes were all DHL, but this time Apex really... I've bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not low. Does it feel like it's higher grade than NIKE ADIDAS?
Actually, they're all the same, so let's go for overseas online shopping.
Size: I am 176CM tall and weigh 68KG. I usually wear size 180 for my shoulder width. I bought M size, the hem is slightly long, but the rest fits well. I see some recommend S size, are they so slim? Or do they prefer tight-fitting? I think hoodies should be a bit loose.
Just the right size.
With a chest circumference of 99, height of 184, and weight of 84 kg, I consulted customer service before purchasing and was told to buy XXL. However, after reading the reviews, I decisively chose L. Upon receiving the item, I found that the size was just right. I almost got tricked.
The prices on Singles' Day are much higher than on Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The issue with Z's affordable goods is troublesome!
The order placed on the 18th only arrived on the 25th, the speed from Guangzhou to Beijing is like a snail's pace!
I bought a product from Z, which was described as having scratches, but when I received it, I found that it was missing four screws and nuts!
The child didn't want to return the item, thinking the problem wasn't serious, but the small parts like accessories couldn't be found in several nearby hardware stores by the child's grandfather!
Finally, grandpa stuck it on!
It seems that I can't buy cost-effective products from Z anymore!
The quality of the toy processing is not good.
Most of the bolt holes did not align, and it was difficult to screw in the top bolt, indicating poor manufacturing quality. It's uncertain how long it can be used, but since it was a promise made to the child, it won't be returned.
Other reviews said the installation was easy, am I the only one who had a problem with this one I bought?
Very ordinary.
Am I just unlucky?
The packaging is extremely old; the craftsmanship is average; there is only one type of music and it is only 8 seconds long and then repeats constantly; the action is just shaking the head and walking forward, with no variation.
It's not worth the price.
It's urgent, so I won't return it.
The quality of the toy is good, but the packaging leaves something to be desired.
I received a package yesterday that I bought from Amazon. It was marked as being shipped by EMS, but it was finally delivered by Tmall's courier. How many turns did it take? Do Amazon and Tmall have a good relationship?
Regarding the packaging, it was wrapped in several layers of cling film, without even a bubble wrap inside. Upon opening, all the parts were just placed in an empty box. Thankfully, the quality of the toy was good and there were no broken parts, but it was much smaller than imagined. Since it's not battery-operated, it often derails when pushed by hand. The gap on both sides of the track seems too large, indicating an unreasonable design.
Good quality, fun.
It's very fun, the components are highly precise, the craftsmanship is exquisite, and the quality is almost comparable to Lego. The price is very favorable during promotions.
The assembly process was quite fun, I did the assembly and my 5-year-old son played with it, it was great.
He had a blast playing with it~ I'll probably continue to buy toys from this brand in the future.
The machine is new, overseas shopping is good.
I checked on Christmas, the one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the current delivery is a bit slower.
The machine is quite good, all very new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then, connecting the Poke Ball will give you a Dream.
It's quite fun to play, with higher portability than the PS4.
I've already bought Zelda, waiting for the game, will try it again.
Producing poor quality goods, selling poor quality goods, resulting in poor service. I bought six watches to give to my children, one of which has an incomplete digital display, and the time on all six watches is inconsistent, varying by several hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watch was time-checked upon storage. They replied "yes." If so, why is there such a big time difference? It must be that the watch is not accurate, simply put, it's a grey market product. I don't mean to be rude, but look, they are selling it with obvious quality issues (incomplete digital display). Isn't it junk?
I contacted the seller, who gave a lot of reasons and complained that I shouldn't have bought their product in the first place. With such a product, such a seller, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future?
In conclusion, I advise against buying from this seller, as the items purchased are just junk.
Amazon delivery issues.
Upon receiving the goods, it was found that:
The packaging is severely worn out.
The table instructions have serious usage creases.
The table doesn't move, the desk lamp can't be used for charging, and the time can't be adjusted.
4. Contacted Amazon customer service separately, could only send to the United States at my own expense, and then reimburse the postage.
The reason for the 5.2 score is that the customer service is quite good.
It can only be said to be passable.
The time is not very accurate, it's about a second fast every day, and after only a few months it's already over two minutes fast.
I've used a Seiko before, and it didn't lose more than a few seconds over a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the timing function is somewhat superfluous, basically not used, and occasionally accidentally enters the timing mode.
Solar-powered sports watch.
Advantages: Solar charging eliminates the need to replace batteries, it has world time, multiple alarms and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror is easily scratched and dust can get in.
Cost-effectiveness: The general price in China is between 220-300, while overseas purchases can be obtained for just over 180 (delivery time is about a week).
A very satisfactory watch.
It's definitely genuine, I've had it checked at the counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It's incomparable to those so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred. This one is truly worth its price.
The watch keeps time very accurately, with errors well within the acceptable range. The packaging includes a jewelry appraisal certificate, and the 12 o'clock position on the dial is a real diamond. This is suitable for personal use and also makes a prestigious gift.
The Bentley watch is indeed good.
The worst shopping experience in history.
On the evening of September 23rd, my wife dropped her phone, so on a whim, I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock but not sold directly by Amazon and there was no price increase (which made me secretly happy). However, because it was not sold directly by Amazon, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the latest expected delivery date would be September 27th.
My wife was extremely uncomfortable without a mobile phone. She woke me up at 6 o'clock the next morning to figure out a solution. Later, I checked on JD.com and saw that the 256G model was in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I had to immediately order another one.
Having bought the new one, I immediately thought of cancelling the order on Amazon.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was not possible to receive the delivery in the early morning. At around 7 o'clock, the customer service was contacted to cancel the order, and they replied that it had been cancelled and to wait for a text message notification.
Well, I waited patiently until noon, checked my phone and saw that the order was still not shipped. I immediately contacted customer service to cancel the order, and they replied that it had been done.
By 3 p.m., I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again, clearly stating that this was my third call, and asked them to cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship!
The customer service contacted the seller on my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would cancel the order after getting familiar with it.
But rest assured, the seller has been clearly informed and will definitely not ship.
When I checked the order status again on Monday, it had already been shipped, which left me speechless.
Since it was impossible to contact the seller directly, the only option was to call customer service again.
The subsequent handling was simply speechless, basically I had to instruct every step for the customer service to follow.
The order is still in a state of delivery refusal so far, and is preparing for another delivery!
Won't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
The selling company doesn't care about follow-up since they've already received the money.
In summary, I will definitely not prepay for large items in the future, it's too much trouble.
It looks very beautiful.
I had my eye on this camera for a long time, but didn't buy it due to the price and some other reasons. This time, because of the free shipping and a reasonable price, I decided to purchase it.
After purchasing, everything else was fine except for the software connection, which just couldn't connect. My home uses a TP router, and after searching online, I found that many people have this problem. I spent over two hours adjusting various router settings, and finally managed to set it up using 360WIFI as a medium. During this time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions for this problem and directly told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another point worth noting is that I saw user comments online saying that the smallest storage card this camera supports is 8G, it cannot recognize smaller storage capacities, so please be aware of this.
The usage feels okay, the visuals are acceptable, but the sound quality is poor. The device heats up to a certain extent, which feels a bit hard to accept if it's always on.
In conclusion, this product has many shortcomings, so please be cautious when purchasing.
The reason for the 3 stars is because this was bought with my first love, we were together for almost 3 years, and then it left me last year, until now.
The reason for the 3 stars is because this was bought with my first love, and now I don't know to what extent it has been used, or perhaps it has been thrown away!
After nearly three years of dating, she left me last year, and every time I think of her, I feel so heartbroken that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life, she left me with a lifetime of shadows and heartache, and I still haven't been able to move on.
When I bought this phone, I thought about the two feelings at the time, we could share weal and woe together, but now it's unbearable to look back. Perhaps life is like this, there are some people you don't want to meet in a lifetime, and some things you don't want to know in a lifetime, but what can you do?
Every time I see this Samsung phone, I am reminded of her and the pain that comes with it, filling my entire body. I've never allowed myself to use a phone that costs more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate. No matter how good you are to someone, when they change their heart one day, all the promises and vows will vanish into thin air.
Premium products among domestic brands.
Huawei is a premium brand among domestic products.
The low-key boss and company rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business atmosphere of improving visibility through advertising operations!
Companies without strength simply cannot and dare not do this!
It is for this reason that I chose Huawei.
I've been using it for over half a year since I bought it, and it's been really good, very nice.
The reason it didn't get a perfect score is because there was one instance where it failed to locate during offline navigation, and I couldn't figure out why. Other than that, it worked well.
Moreover, its online input of the destination, automatically designs the route after searching. After leaving the wifi, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical, without using data, it directly communicates with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, which is very good!
Sony is great.
This low-end model from Sony still has a full sense of design, is affordable, has a large screen, excellent battery life, and is very suitable for the elderly to use.
Although a lot of time has passed, this machine still has no problems.
However, since my Z2 has been put away, this phone has also completed its mission.
