In the shadow of extinction: Three bridal puppies born in Iran
The world's fastest animal is being subjected to cruel hunting, droughts and deadly road accidents across the Islamic Republic
As a result, fewer than 20 breeders were left.
Three Asian birdel puppies were recently born in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
It's a rare birth, which only slightly improves the plight of the critically endangered animal in the country from droughts, poaching and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of the Birds in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where bradles still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported that the veterinary staff of the Turhan National Park Trust in northern Samnan province has decided on a C-section in captivity.
It also noted that fewer than 20 bridlestones had been documented in seven different counties in the state.
Faced with extinction, the UN implemented a protection program for them back in 2001.
Now, in Iran, it is hoped that the new cubs can lead to an increase in the burdock population in the future.
In January, Iran's deputy minister of environment, Hassan Akbari, said that the bird population in the country declined dramatically from 100 in 2010 to just 12 birds.
"Their condition is extremely serious", said Akbari, noting that they have been the victims of drought in their habitat, hunting, and even traffic accidents.
The birdy is reputed to be the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching speeds of up to 60 miles an hour.
Bredels can be found in various places around the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car. We tested the Car Thing.
Slowly, slowly, Spotify has started to try its luck in the hardware world as well.
After years of development, Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the U.S.
We put our hands on the first instrument in Israel
The vision: Make your old cars smart
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and it was built specifically to provide a solution for people with old cars.
A few weeks ago, I was given a first opportunity to try out the new product, which is currently only available to single moms in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was extraordinary, as our home car broke down and we had to drive for days in a replacement car with an old system.
After two weeks of fun, I realized how the car thing could easily become an integral part of many people's systems.
On the other hand, with the long waiting list and the uncertainties around a global launch, I believe that many people already prefer to use other solutions.
From Concept to Reality
Sometime in 2018, Spotify users started receiving an interesting offer in their email inbox -- the possibility to get a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which would turn any old system into a smart car.
Rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company was soon planning to introduce a new product for a smart car radio with neuronal connectivity.
A few months later, these rumours made headlines again after the music service updated the vehicle status -- the one we now know from the app -- which is triggered as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the in-car system.
It's been two years since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled last April the Car Thing, its smart car system.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device on a very limited basis, with a long waiting list and many delays in shipment.
So of course, right after the press conference, I went to the website and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited message arrived.
Re-logging will buy me the device with a little surprise - it will cost me nothing.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, with a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First of all, I was very impressed with the quality of the Spotify device.
And it's a little bit smaller than my iPhone 11 and it has a bigger, brighter, sharper touchscreen at the front than I expected.
Also, you'll find on the side of the screen a round button and a circle that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge circle, which you can see in the photos, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer that the company let me change the circuit activity so that I can control the volume on the smartphone, since I can also navigate using the touch screen.
Maybe this will be possible in a future update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, including a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you may remember how in the past we used to turn off our radios and hide them in the drawer when we got out of the car.
The Car Thing certainly brings that feeling back with its construction.
All the adaptations were attached to the body of the device by a very strong magnet, which prevented it from falling off even while driving on dirt roads.
Also, along the entire top there are little buttons that can be easily set to play different playlists or podcasts.
By long pressing one of the buttons while playing, or by requesting a voice assistant, I set some of the playlists that I hear most often and the radio show that I listen to every morning on the highway.
In doing so, Fisher made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From an old car to a smart car
After a fairly simple physical installation, I connected the Car Thing to the power.
I was pleasantly surprised by the process of definition.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than five minutes, and a few moments later I was on my home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through a glutton and controls the app like a controller, so it can copy all of our account data from it.
So, you'll still have to connect your smartphone to the car, whether it's through a gloppy or an AUX cable to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all app users, as like the smartphone app, it puts an emphasis on album photos and playlists.
Also on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations to suit your taste, the search screen, and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between different screens using the touch screen or by using the handheld display.
Furthermore, you can call the device's voice assistant at any time by saying "Hey Spotify".
With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
In my experience, she recognized my voice pretty easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was blowing directly on the instrument.
It's probably due to the four microphones that are mounted on the top of it.
It is important to note that right now the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and at the time of publishing, there is no information about when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for?
And my experience with the device has been great, and that's a positive surprise to me considering it's still in the early release phases.
Even with heavy use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Nevertheless, occasionally a little bit of a glitch occurred in the interface, but I believe that Spotify will address those bugs with future updates.
Obviously, the Swedish company had been working on it a lot over the last few years, and of the various versions that have leaked online over that period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered exactly who the company was trying to target.
'Cause its activity boils down to controlling the app on the smartphone, and not much else.
What's different than buying a car for a few bucks and plugging it in so that your smartphone is closer to you while you're driving?
That question gets stronger when you consider that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify, and will typically buy you a lot more functionality.
Nevertheless, the more I used the Car Thing, the more I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
The ability to see the Waze on my smartphone screen and control the music on a completely different screen is something that I've learned to appreciate in the last two weeks.
One question remains -- will Spotify ever release the device to the general public?
And if so, will it be established here in our little country?
The Swedish society isn't saying much right now.
She didn't even share how many new features for the device she is currently rolling out around the world, and how many she plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is that the price is expected to be $79.
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides a first glimpse into a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel reported that there is no information currently on a plan to launch the device in the country.

Did you recruit talent for the company?
That way you can make sure your competitors don't get it from you.
The economy is still in a labour market dominated by workers, and this is also true when it comes to the most desirable workers - talent •
Here are some tips to help you keep it in your workplace
I know.
Despite the increase registered last month, the unemployment rate in Israel remains one of the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand people unemployed, according to the ILO).
That is, the economy is still in a labor market dominated by workers, and this is particularly true for the most desirable  talented workers.
As for those professionals and managers who are sources of knowledge, experience and proven capacity, the trends in the labour market show that competition for these, the talents as they are called by employers, is still in full swing.
What this means for employers is that in the current state of the job market, they don't have the luxury of resting on the sidelines even a minute after recruiting a desired talent, because as soon as he walks through the company's doors another company is already trying to snatch him in.
In other words, the competition for talent is so intense that many even after recruitment will continue to receive a barrage of enticing job offers, with 30% of employees indeed leaving within one month of being hired and starting.
That's why smart employers will immediately move from talent recruitment to talent retention, starting first and foremost by planning in advance and being creative in the hiring process.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful recruitment process will make the talent excited about their new workplace from day one and even look forward to the future.
Here are some tips on how to set up and run a proper hiring process to help retain new talent:
It's not a secret -- sharing and organizing.
Share the factors that will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he's vital and important to the company and the role, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives where he is expected and understands his value will feel wanted and will strive to prove his expected.
Knowledge is power -- align expectations.
On the first day, they had a talent coordination expectation call.
Get to know his professional background and find out where he sees himself in the future, so that you can show him the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him to get there.
We are all people -- personal acquaintances.
During the recording days we tried to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and were interested in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who is interested and allowed to express himself beyond the confines of his job will appreciate that and want to keep it that way.
Curiosity comes first.
Even at the intake stage, you can create an attraction that will make the talent want to fit in quickly.
And do it not by talking about bonuses and perks, but by exposing him to an exciting field or an interesting technology, because that kind of stimulation of creativity leads to curiosity and increased interest in the workplace.
Also, encourage talent to voice their thoughts and opinions about the various projects in the company and make it clear that they are important to the organization.

Pocket electricity: The cost of not closing coal stations in June - NIS 1 billion
Knesset Research and Information Center report: Failure to close coal plants by June 2022 estimated at NIS 1 billion
• Power company: "Fuel policy is written primarily by the Department of Energy"
I know.
The economic cost of not closing coal stations by the June 2022 deadline is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is reflected in the consumer electricity tariff, which is expected to rise in the coming months due to the rise in coal prices.
Moreover, by 2023, an additional surplus of some 900,000 tons of coal is expected to be used, so that this could be reflected in an additional cost to the electricity industry due to the continuation of coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas remains significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report said that the approximately $4.5 billion reduction in electricity rates by 2022 would mean a reduction in the cost of electricity to the home user of about 4 percent.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about $8 million, and the total reduction for home customers would be about 4 percent.
It should be noted that as part of the electricity sector reform, it was decided, among other things, to create a subsidiary of the electricity company, which will establish natural gas-powered units, intended to replace the 4-1 coal units at the Rabin Light site.
Following this decision, a government decision was adopted in July 2018, determining that the activities of the 4-1 coal production units at the Oruç Rabin power plant should be discontinued.
The decision established timetables, so that the construction of the first unit with natural gas will begin in January 2020 and its operation will start in June 2022, and accordingly the 4-1 coal production units will also cease to operate at that date.
The utility responded: "The fuel policy is written primarily by the Department of Energy.
In accordance with the decisions of the Ministry, a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas".
Paying the Price: Everything You Need to Know About Rising Interest Rates
Continuing cuts: Next week interest on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent
How much will the mortgage payment cost?
• What is the best way to avoid conflict?
All the answers.
Rising inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise interest rates on the shekel as early as next week.
Analyst estimates speak of a rate of increase ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.
If you actually raise the interest rate by half a percent, it would stand at 1.25%, the high level it's been at for nine years.
That's after years of near zero interest rates on the economy.
The sharp rise in interest rates is raising mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and putting a drastic burden on households.
With the help of Shae Zarror, a mortgage expert, we looked at how much more we could pay and what to do right now.
If the interest rate goes up by a half a percent, how much will the monthly mortgage payment cost?
On a mortgage of $1,200,000, consisting of a 40 percent rate, the monthly payment will be $1.40.
What was the average mortgage since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, it's been a significant rise.
This is because the interest rates on all the other paths that comprise a mortgage (and not just the prime path) have also gone up -- the narrow meter path and the fixed rate path.
If interest does go up by half a percent, the increase would amount, as Chrour estimates, to about $400,000 in a mortgage of about $1,200,000.
The prime route (40% of this route) will complete an increase of some R16, assuming a further increase of 0.5% next month.
A narrow-angle variable interest rate path (26.7% on this path) will complete an increase of about $130
The fixed rate path - not a narrow rate (33.3% on this path) will be increased by NIS 220.
So what is the best thing to do today?
For those who have a mortgage that's mostly close to the meter, the chain recommends considering recycling to non-contiguous pathways.
For mortgage borrowers whose monthly returns have increased significantly and who find it difficult to meet repayments - he recommends taking a mortgage restructuring and rescheduling it over a longer period.
This to reduce the payments despite the increase in interest, since it is always better to be on the rewards than to be in bankruptcy haste.
As for new mortgage borrowers - he strongly recommends getting to know the different avenues and tailoring the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
So in the future, when interest rates go down, they can do a mortgage recycling with minimum early-payment fees.
For home buyers, Krzor recommends making advance payments to your landlord and taking out a mortgage now.
Consider that the building assessment increases the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract is signed.
The housing-contribution-price index has risen by 6.6% in the last year.
In light of the increase in this index, the previous day the Banking Supervision Authority announced that it was considering the creation of a mechanism that would enable to include attachments in mortgages, but the final decision on this issue has not yet been made.
The price of gasoline is soaring - and Israelis will have to pay more than 8 shekels per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy has announced that the new price for a liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08 shekels.
At the same time, until the end of 2022, the reduction of half a shilling per liter of solar tax is a big deal.
The price of gasoline will jump by 36 cents a liter -- and stand at more than 8 cents a liter as of July 1.
The new price for the liter of 95-octane gasoline, will stand at 8.08 and those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 cents per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the solar tax will last until the end of 2022 - according to the tax authorities.
As mentioned, the price increase stems from the continued rise in oil prices, against the backdrop of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in the dollar.
Had it not been for the half-shekel subsidy the government has been providing since April, the price of gasoline would have reached an all-time high of 8.25 shekels a liter.
The discount expires at the end of July and the tax authorities and the Treasury are currently promoting public comment for an executive order extending the reduction in the gasoline tax, which is half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
Also, starting from August 10, a further reduction of another half shekel will be set, so that only from this time the price of a liter of gasoline will be reduced by one shekel until November 15, 2022.
That's what the IRS says.
We've reached a point where I can't remember five months in a row of surplus government revenue.
We started a few months ago with the solar tax cut.
We've been working for a week on a four-month extension of the gas, diesel, and solar taxes instead of half a shekel.
It's good for the industry and good for citizens.
If we lower, it will affect inflation, reduce production and lower the cost of living.
As Minister of Finance, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus primarily on this", said Minister Lieberman at the Horwitz Conference on Economics and Society at the Israel Institute for Democracy.
Today, more than half of the price of fuel is taxed by the government - at a higher tax rate than in most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business spending, public transportation and airline fares, transportation costs, and so on.
For the third time in a row, Ashdod - the most business-friendly city
Fatah Ummah was ranked second in the Ministry of Economy's Doing Business
Followed by: Streets, Ashkelon and first to score •
Minister Barbivay: "Corona has highlighted the importance of local government in business development"
I know.
Ashdod is the most friendly city for small and medium businesses.
This is the third year in a row the Doing Business in Local Authorities Index has found that, from the SME Agency of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranks local authorities.
In second place is the city of hope, and in third place is the streets.
Then, in the following order, are Ashkelon, First of Zion, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Beth-im, Netanya, and the sons of Barak.
The agency compiles the local authority index.
This is the fifth time and it is intended to be a tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities on a variety of parameters, as well as analyse its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on a number of parameters tested by each authority, which test the authority's level of "friendliness" to businesses in its jurisdiction.
The index divides municipalities into three size groups by the number of inhabitants, since a local authority of up to 50,000 inhabitants is not the same as a local authority of more than 150,000.
T.A. jumped this year.
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings for each local authority: business satisfaction, access to tenders, accessibility to information and sustainability.
The list shows that Jan's rank dropped from second to eighth, Yitchin from fourth to 12th, and Nathania from fifth to 13th.
A downgrade doesn't mean that the Authority's service to business has declined, and in many cases it's because other authorities' service to business has improved more, and they've come up in the rankings, while the Authority that got downgraded improved less in its service to business.
Among those ranked are the Port of Hope, which rose from sixth to second, and Streets, which rose from 12th to third.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place to 11th in 2019, improved in 2021 to sixth place.
"Business - The Engine of Growth"
The ranking indicates that the Galilee landscape leads in local authorities with between 50,000 and 150,000 inhabitants.
It is followed by Keriot-Machin, the headquarters of Binyamin, the intelligence offices of the Bad Campaign, the village of Babu, Renana, Riya, Karmiel, Afula and Houd Has-Saron.
In 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The measure is designed to encourage local authorities to facilitate small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the moment they open their business and throughout their activity in front of the authorities", says Minister of Economy and Industry Orna Barbivai.
"Business is a significant engine of growth for the Israeli economy and accounts for about 50% of GDP and about 60% of employment in the economy.
Small business development is in the public interest for all of us, but the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses that are there.
The corona has emphasised the importance of local government and we have seen that authorities who took action to encourage small businesses and found creative solutions for them, have become the first governmental interface for them".
Ran Koiti, director of the Small and Medium-Sized Business Agency in the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and vital role in enabling businesses in their area to thrive and prosper.
In the last two years, as we've been dealing with the corona crisis, authorities have had an even bigger role in helping businesses survive in their area and survive in general".
March 2021: 20 packages for each household - and a jump in weight
46.6 million parcels arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020
The average weight per package stands at 435 grams - a 36% jump from 2020
The busiest month: December, when the average package weighed 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million packages arrived in Israel, almost 20 packages on average per household - according to Israel Post data obtained by Israel Today.
The number of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019 - when 61.6 million packages arrived.
Even so, this year there has been an annual increase of more than 36 percent in the weight of packages from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, a jump of 36 percent from 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight of a package has climbed by 60 percent in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The increase in the pack weight is mainly influenced by two major trends, both on the seller and the buyer side: Large overseas shopping sites are uniting items for single delivery, and are no longer sending each product from the shopping cart in separate packaging.
On the Israeli consumer side, the fast delivery of the shipments, within a few days of ordering, supports the purchase of more everyday goods such as clothing and gifts, which the buyers wish to receive nearby when the purchase is made.
In 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month with the highest weight and number of packages arriving from overseas was also December, with 4.2 million packages weighing a total of 2,200 tons.
In December the average weight of each package was 13 ounces [524 g], 20 percent above the annual average.
Black Friday effect
More packages arrived in December than any other month, likely due to the November shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles' Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The big orders start arriving in Israel a week or two after the purchase.
Research: Most renters in the economy are unaware that tax refunds can be obtained
Many tenants receive money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels
You changed jobs?
You went to space?
Did you move from the city to the settlement?
You may be entitled to a lump sum in a simple procedure •
All the details - inside
Most tenants are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to large sums.
The comptroller of the state noted in a report from about two months ago that two million workers are eligible for a tax refund of NIS 3.6 billion, which means you should check if you're eligible, too.
Many employees can get a large sum, as four out of five employees are entitled to a tax refund.
In practice, however, several tens of thousands of employees file a year.
If you think that these funds have just disappeared anyway, think again: employees can file a tax return for six years back.
Tax:On conducted an in-depth survey of 4,000 of its customers' tax returns during 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their dispersion by demographic groups and by gender, age, and geography.
The data shows that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of workers to the U.S., several significant changes occurred, most notably a 15% increase in the average amount of home reimbursement of NIS 4,300 per year.
The reason is that the basic tax is lower than the wages, and therefore there's a gap between what the worker pays in taxes and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest return received in 2020 by a customer of the company was a sum of NIS 121,054 for returns over the past 6 years.
What do you get a tax refund on?
One of the reasons to get a tax refund is a change of workplace.
Eighty-one percent of the people who switched jobs during the year received an average tax refund of $2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of women who had a baby and were on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were eligible for an average of NIS 3,538 that year.
Another reason to give back is donations.
100% of the people who contribute and pay taxes get their money back.
Another factor for repayment is the failure to register alimony points. 63%.
Divorced people have never updated a child support allowance, so the tax refund for each year that such an allowance is not updated is NIS 2,616.
Due to Unemployment: 93% of those who went on unemployment and who earned more than $1,000 received a tax refund of $1,500 for that year.
Other grounds for a tax refund are: the refund for life insurance payments, mortgage life insurance, profit recovery, the refund for losses in securities, registration of credit points for a man for birth and the division of the return by geographical location.
94% of people who took a personal life insurance policy or a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In a review of each million dollar mortgage for 25 years, the cumulative tax refund for the period is over $20,000 for the entire term of the mortgage.
100% of the transition to a welfare state received a tax refund for the year of transition as approval for residence in a welfare state is only given after 12 months from the date of becoming a welfare state and thus, in effect, the first year is fully taxed.
79% of customers holding securities were eligible for a tax refund for those years.
However, it is important that those who hold securities check annually since losses are not rolled over from year to year but only by filing a report.
56% of men who have a baby don't take credit points in the year of birth in their paycheck.
The payback rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over six years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab world.
Tax:on CEO, Tal Karmon: "The corona crisis has caused the Israeli paid public to become much more active.
He takes an interest, audits and claims what he's owed in income tax returns.
It turns out that sitting at home, on leave or after being dismissed, of hundreds of thousands of Israelis for long months, has made many hirelings to look deep into what they deserve from the country.
It's important to know that today one can do all the procedures for getting a tax return digitally, easily and simply, without the red tape that deterred many in the past".
The job market: fewer applicants, more pay
Alljobs report summary 2021: Top of the demand - jobs with no experience •
Job openings increased by 50% •
"Looking for work, but not storming the market"
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decrease in the number of resumes submitted, with an average of only 23 candidates running for each post, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year - according to a 2021 report from the OLJobs website, summarizing the corona crisis and its effects on the Israeli labor market.
According to the report, job seekers were most interested in career fields such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were submitted.
However, inexperienced jobs led the search with over 38,000 searches - presumably as a result of inexperienced young people returning to look for immediate work at the end of their internships.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and security had just under 9,000.
On the other hand, despite the corona crisis, the salary in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average salary in Israel stood at NIS 11,675 gross.
The average monthly salary in software was $44,900, and in information systems analysis it was $1,700.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a wage gap of more than NIS 2,000: in the center of the country it was NIS 12,500 on average, compared to NIS 10,795 in the north and NIS 10,135 in the south.
Gender-wise, the average pay gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the duration of the hours, remained at 36%.
Men were paid NIS 13,295, compared with the women's salary of NIS 9,740.
Trying to get back on track
On the business side, there was exponential growth in almost every sector of the economy, and businesses needed workers.
Thus, job offer increased by 50% and a record of more than 40,000 jobs in the oljobes.
A survey conducted by the website among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% stated an intention to increase their headcount, but 72% said they would have difficulty doing so this year.
The largest bid was for no-experience jobs -- and there were over 58,000 of them on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration with about 44,000 jobs in each area, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and warehousing still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Ineb Wimfeld, director of research and content at Alljobs: "Job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market, mainly because of the lack of attractive jobs.
Also, the long disconnection from work makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living".
The unemployment rate in Israel has risen to 6.3%
Bureau survey data shows that about 270,000 Israelis were unemployed in December 2021.
In November, there were about 262,000 unemployed.
The unemployment rate in the first half of December 2021 stood at 6.3%, about 270,000 Israelis, compared to 6.1% in the second half of November 2021 (about 262,000).
This is according to the Central Bureau of Statistics Human Resources Survey for the first half of December 2021.
The unemployment rate stood at 4.5% in the first half of December 2021 compared to 4.3% in the second half of November 2021.
In other words, it's 193,000 unemployed versus 180,3000.
According to the characteristics of the labor force in the first half of December 2021 among those aged 15 and above it emerges that this population included 6,607,500 residents in Israel, not including institutions and grims outside the settlements.
Of these, 64.4%, or 4,252,700 are in the labor force and the remaining 2,354,800 are not in the labor force.
Of those in the labor force, 95.5% of the 4,059,700 are employed and the rest are unemployed.
Of those not in the labor force, 2.3% have stopped working due to layoffs or closures since March 2020.
The Manpower Survey provides information on the Israeli workforce and is conducted regularly by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
In the first half of December 2021, 8,700 people aged 15 and over were interviewed on a regular basis.
In the second half of November 2021, approximately 8,900 people aged 15 and older were interviewed on a regular basis.
The survey population includes permanent residents of the State of Israel, tourists and temporary residents who have been in Israel for more than one year.
The survey allows the monitoring of the development of the labour force, its size and characteristics, the level of unemployment and more.
"Uncertain": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrating "we can live as we wish", gets excited about meeting the audience and makes sure to spend time with the children
The weekend and the independence day of Kobe Shimon, Sublime.
What's your typical Friday look like?
"The weekends are the most important moments in my life.
Holiness and tradition are very deeply rooted in my soul.
Friday nights are for the children, Orr (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and sacraments, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play cars on the sign.
Sometimes we go to the beach or even just to wash the car, but we always stop to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store - there's always another excuse.
When we come home with the spoils of the gifts, the smells of the cooking greet us".
How's your Friday dinner look?
I've been blessed with cooks around me.
Next to me is Persian-Tunisian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, song and joy.
On the part of my wife Ines, who's also a great cook, comes the Ukrainian food, which is deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
By the time we get to my mother-in-law, the lobby of the building already emits incredible scents from her apartment.
I usually do the consecration with the children, who know it by heart.
After all, my pleasure after dinner is passing out on the carpet, and the kids jumping on me like I'm some kind of bloat".
Do you have any special childhood memories from the weekends?
"As a child, I would wake up on Saturdays to the sounds of Israeli music on the j network and the pale radar channels which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every remote corner of the land made his heart proud.
He passed away three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Lent and the Sabbath were holy days, especially since the whole family has to be together.
I recently released a song in his honor called "Warding of You", which I wrote with Usher Cohen.
I believe he would have been proud of this piece, which celebrates the bond between father and son".
As an ardent Zionist, how do you feel about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a sacred day to me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who is allowed to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I was already climbing trees and being tied to a house of wires with Israeli flags.
Now my days of independence are filled with gigs, always met with a raving and happy crowd, celebrating that we can live the way we want.
We must ensure that our children, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren are given that choice, as well, and remember that nothing is taken for granted".
Her Friday: Estee Zackheim blessing the Sabbath
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": the Friday dinner that Sati Zakheim dreams about, and how does she cope with the fact that her husband keeps a Sabbath?
Tell me about your willingness to sit down.
I know.
"The preparations begin as early as Thursday night, when I return from a show or workshop and cook until three o'clock in the morning all the things that require long cooking such as sauce, stew and soap.
Friday, the first part of the day, I devote the time to myself, meet with friends and acquaintances for coffee, a show or a movie, or I go to rehearsals.
Summer vacation comes in late, and I have a lot of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch a sunset or just a good show.
"At dinner on Saturday, I usually invite my mother, Verda, who just turned 89, and friends".
Can we share some more cooking?
"I like shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry them.
On my Saturday table you'll find meat dishes, vegan tofu, potatoes and cabbage in the oven.
Most of the cooking is done by me, and they are, of course, heated on the stove on Saturday.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad, and in the winter, the Chollet".
Your husband is a religious man and you come from a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with a Sabbath keeper is an infinite compromise.
"And love thy neighbor as thyself", actually went.
Family outings, he can't go out, so I found myself packing up the kids and joining friends' families outings a lot.
Plus, I'm the kid's shift driver, the one who picks them up on Friday nights from parties and get-togethers.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Sabbath, because usually I don't show up on Sabbath and get a kind of 'forced leave' - which is good".
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
"I would open a big table and invite my dead.
Sometimes I wonder if my brother Daniel, Jr., were still alive, or if my father, Shenior, Jr., could see my children - Aurele, 23, and the twins Tamar and Naamah, 16 and a half.
We probably fought about football and politics and brands and branding".
Do you have any special childhood memories from the weekends?
"We were a warm and united family.
Friday afternoon, Mother would prepare a pile of noodles, bring back hummus and lures from the market, and burn some parsnips to make a salad.
Then we'd go to Aunt Hannah's with the Eliyahu hand, or as she used to say, "Elyachek's hand", and she'd make Linch's.
Since I was the only one who didn't like raisins, she'd make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the little one, and she worried about me.
On Saturdays, my father and I would tour the Joppa harbor, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, had come to the country with nothing".

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are engaged.
Almost two decades after their love story ended in divorce, Lopez and Aflek are back in each other's arms.
Lopez parted ways with baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021.
I know.
His one: Nearly two decades after their first love affair ended in divorce and a year after their enthralling return, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic circle and getting engaged.
The good news was shared last night by Lopez with her fan on her official website onthejlo.com
I know.
News of the engagement comes a week after Lopez was seen spinning like a giant diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
As you may remember, the last time Shafley, 49, pulled a ring and offered Lopez, 52, to be his forever was in 2002, and it was a dazzling ring with a giant six-carat pink diamond, worth an estimated $2.5 million.
Despite grand gestures of love, the two broke up in 2004, accusing the media of over-obsessing and relentlessly rummaging through their lives.
Apple has since managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as it is known, has been married three times before, including to singer Mark Anthony, who together became parents to twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she separated in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians are saying, "You can't make up what happens to us".
"The Unending Chaos", Chris Jenner's mom pushing for the new series starring the first family of reality, and getting backing from her daughters and the new producer •
In the article to be published in Shabbat magazine, they talk about big money, the public relations industry, the brand factory and the change Kim wants to make in the world:
It may come as a surprise to many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 for the Disney content empire, which also includes Marvel and Star Wars, is the Kardashian family.
Details of the premiere family's reality and social media contract with Disney were not disclosed, but estimates suggest a minimum of $100 million has been transferred to the family, who now also serve as producers.
At a press conference with the stars, each of them accompanied by a whole beauty crew that takes care of the makeup, hair and wrinkles in their clothes, the girls of the family, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it is not reality, this time what they receive on the screen is completely authentic.
"We can't invent what's happening to us", says the mother, Kris Jenner, vehemently, "the chaos is endless".
"We're showing how much we've grown since that show came out in 2007", says Khloe Kardashian.
"When we started, we were terrified that there's so much going on in our lives, you can't just pin everything down to a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
A lot of plots were rushed through the editing, wrapped in pop-up color film and left behind.
This is not what real life is like.
Now we're more exposed, turning directly to the camera naturally, not just reality but authentic documentary".
When confronted with their new involvement in production, which effectively gives them total control over the content that's on screen, Chloe states, "We're involved behind the scenes, watching pieces while they're being edited and providing commentary, but not from a position of patronage, but just giving our opinions on what would make the show better.
It's a reflection of our lives, and I personally feel like I've done an emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they're more of a boundary-setter".
"I have grown up".
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues to push hard to change her image from cheap reality trash to lawyer with an agenda.
"I grew up", she says, "raising four black children, meaning from a marginalized and underprivileged community in this country.
I want to change reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends have a different future, in hopes that we can heal this crooked system.
This is my motivation".
"I'm not the same Kim who spent hours thinking about which bikini selfie to upload", she insists, "but it's not completely gone from my life, either.
A person must be true to who he really is and take it all in stride".
On the reasons for the executive layoffs uncovered by Ryan Seacrest, on their very lucrative new path in the industry, the meaning of the transition to Disney, the family's oiled slot machine and its impact on the brand's profitability and more, in a full article to be published in Saturday magazine.
Indingv with an international flavour: Afghan Whigs joined Abhir Bani and Nge Erz
The American rock band joins the ranks of local artists taking part this year in the Desert Music Festival, considered a pilgrimage event among many music lovers
Afghan Whigs, Shalomi Shephan, Nega Erez, Abhir Bani and Tess are among the names taking part in the Indiegogo festival, taking place from October 20 to 22.

Other musicians who appear on the lineup include: Hilla Goh, Teddy Nagosa, Daniela Spector, Jubel Mendelsohn and the Journey to Poland, The White Screen Band, Riff Cohen, Carolina, Perfume Minor, Quarter to Africa, Paul Trunk, The Ashes, and many others.
Indingv began in 2007 as a small niche event that brought together the hot names in the Israeli indie scene.
Over the years it has become a regular event for many music lovers, and began to host international names, alongside mainstream artists.
Spring of the Vine and the Harvest of Hadad: an outdoor festival creating new surprises in Jerusalem
The Beirut International Festival, which has become a tradition and will take place in several venues, will feature music performances by leading local artists, and will combine circus shows with innovative and surprising artistic performances.
I know.
As every summer over the years, along with the heat, humidity and boredom of the students, comes the International Outdoor Festival Creating Jerusalem, which has already become a tradition in Beirut and will be held in several locations (including Mitchell Garden, the Sultan Pool, in front of the Tower of David and at the foot of the Old City Walls) between August 15 and August 27.
During the festival there will be daily musical performances by many artists, including Shirt Haddad, Koby Peretz, Spring of Vine and Taout who will host Natasha's friends, Shalomi Shabbat, Era Habib, Nathan Ghosn, Nasrin Kadri, Danny Sanderson who will host Tislam and Amir Daddon, Negah Erz and more.
Alongside the music, there will be two interesting performances this year.
The first is ARTISTA - an exhibition of illuminated representations in public space (designed by Philippe Blau) with other galactic figures that will move among visitors inside a structure and present an entire adventure in both light and night.
The play will incorporate dancers, actors, and physical theater artists who will connect with the audience.
SPARKS is a circus, movement and aerial show of Circus Y, an Instagram photography exhibition inspired by famous artworks.
The Black Box Gallery is a gazebo of the inventor and operator Lior Calafon, set up in the fair grounds with gazebo holes that exposed the audience to exhibitions of his fluorescent works of Lior Calafon, artworks of illuminated sculptures of the multi-dimensional artist Alon Birger (Theatre of Light) and more.
Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
"Next Star" winner finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and his father's significant presence in his life.
"The song is about how to keep the contact at a distance", he says.
Tamir Greenberg on second single Into The Night after conquering the audience with his first single and appearing in "The Next Star".
In recent months Greenberg has continued to make many appearances: at the TMA Culture Hall, TMA Opera House, Shawnee Amphitheater, Joshua Gardens Amphitheater, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
Into The Night was produced and mixed by Greenberg with producer Autumn Baguerre.
The video, directed by Darya Geller, brings Shamir back to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song is about the relationship between my father and me.
About the time I left the country for the US and how to keep in touch at a distance", Greenberg says.
Next month Greenberg will perform at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and in advance of the new season of The Next Star, the song with him won the show, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the audition song for the next season.
Yuval Shamil is the biggest winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world.
The Fenoman climbed Mount Madouriama in 26 seconds and claimed the title of "First Israeli Ninja".
Yugeng Queen climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but won't hold the title of Ning.
The
There's a winner: Yuval Shammel won the Midoriama, and he is the winner of the fourth season of Ninja Israel and now holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and 16th in the world.
Who's been on the show since season one then finished in first place, and the second season he lost to Gil Murnz.
In the third season he won again and most recently returned for the fourth season, and during the filming he declared it would be the last season.
Tonight he made his first ascent of Midoriyama in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after a man in charge was crowned queen by Vishhi Kelpon.
His queen managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It must be noted that according to the rules of the program, only one ninja can be crowned each season, who has climbed the Midoriyama in time.
Therefore, despite Queen's impressive achievement, as the season winner Shivula climbed the Midoriyama 3 seconds faster, Queen does not win the World Ninja title.
He could compete for it again next season.
Okay, we understand that full of superhero, perfect rock, and Ninja Israel is the most important sporting event in the world.
I know.
Two Olympic medalists and a senior sports broadcaster sat in the finale of a reality show and acted like it was the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
I know.
The rock emblem represents for us such a perfect feminine ideal that it's distorted to portray it that way on television.
She's making more money campaigning than Wonder Woman, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when she needs to, to advocate for her business partner as well.
She's a mother and a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads reality TV, and serves as an unconceivable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that the Rock is too perfect, because on a show she hosts, you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the world of ninja, everyone is larger than life, and the guides come first.
Ace Assarji became embroiled in a case that was supposed to wipe him off the screen for a period of time, but since he is not an ordinary human being he got out of it even before the first batch of ads.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Neve Raskin, who has won European and World Cup titles in his life, but he is moved by mega walls as if it is the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the finale, two Olympic medalists (Jordan Gerbi and Lino Ashram) sat with him as commentators, as if to underscore how rare and rare are the entry points to the superhuman world that this reality show has featured for four seasons.
Ninja Israel went out of their way to market the season, which ended last night with Midoriyama and Yuval Shamil managing to climb it in 26 seconds and finally crowned Ninja.
It was an almost impassable trail which brought down, one by one, all the superhuman characters whose egos the program had managed to inflate throughout the year.
You want to be a ninja deer?
Not with us.
This is where they look for superheroes.
Emphasis was placed on the search for an heir to the throne, one called "the King of kings and the only one like him", with other titles designed to emphasize his perfection and uniqueness.
As a result, the difficulty level was raised, the girls trying to compete on the tracks crashed, and the boys competed with each other to see who had the most belly squares and the charisma of a dick to fit into the shoes of the Porsche.
Some say that it is a sports program that encourages physical activity and displays a show of overcoming difficulties and challenges, but to the vast majority of viewers - moderate Kuressa potatoes like us - Ninja Israel cultivates for us a sports model of unimaginable achievement.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gilles Sassover moves from punchlines to talk of holiness
It's strange to see the comedian, X the Comedy Store host Saturday morning programming on Channel 14, where he tastes dishes and sets the stage for mostly male
If we play an association game, we all have similar answers to the question, "What does 'honesty' remind you of?"
Say, "Spoon and washers, gas cookers and smell in the stairwell, Iron Allan or my father as a cook on TV", but the strangest thing is if someone suddenly says "Gil Sassobar".
Because Gil Ssober right in the middle of sponge and cooking is the most unrelated thing television has to offer.
And indeed, "Saturday's Receipt", the new show he hosts on Friday afternoons, at Channel 14, is cut off in spirit from the hour that it airs.
Along half of it, Sasso is standing.
He speaks fast, holds a microphone in his hand even as he tastes dishes, and tries to divide his dose between punches and talk of holiness.
In his defense, the budget deficit is felt, and is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
Yet what's more exciting about the premiere program, broadcast the other day from headquarters in Binyamin, is a clear gender divide.
The men sang, played, danced, spoke, marketed restaurants and factories - while the women contented themselves with a small item, enthusiastically telling about running a sewing business.
Happy women's day to you.
Saturday reception with Gil Sassower, now 14.
Protected Housing League v. Ruthie Rousseau: "To say 'there is a taste of protected housing' hurts our business".
Chairman Julie Gath sent a letter, expressing the union's complaint against what they claim was an offensive remark by the judge of "The Next Restaurant" in one of the trailers for the show.
And Ruthie Rousseau said, "I'm glad there are places that are investing more in the cuisine of this population".
The Association of Orphan Homes and Protected Housing in Israel vs "The Next Restaurant": In a letter sent by the chairman Yuli Gath and reached "Israel Today", it was written as follows: "In the trailer before the broadcast, which was distributed in all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said 'food has the taste of protected housing', ie food from a closed institution with food at low level".
"The tone chosen by the program's judge Ruthie Rousseau to describe her disappointment with the food that the contestant has submitted immediately cancels out our years-long campaign to fight ignorance in the field, this is because sheltered housing groups run in homes other than restaurants for the benefit of tenants with the highest quality chef's orders".
It further stated: "Service teams and home managers are fighting for the image of secure housing offering quality housing solutions for the elderly, including reduction of loneliness, plentiful leisure activities, a high standard of living, and more".
In Israel, in recent years, more and more families and older people realize that loneliness is the most difficult illness of old age and see community spaces as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, so we devote resources and effort to serving the residents the finest food.
Most sheltered housing uses professional chefs to create the menu.
We'll be pleased at any time to invite the judging panel to admire the winning dishes served daily to tens of thousands of elders in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff at the sheltered housing, we ask for your pardon and clarification.
Come together, media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly".
Rousseau responded: "I'm glad there are places that are investing more in the cuisine of this population, which certainly deserves good food later in life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, butchers, chefs and chefs everywhere, even in sheltered housing".
"Double standard: in Russia you cancel a show but not in Israel?"
Nick Cave responding to the criticism
The singer was responding to criticism by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards.
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"
Nick Cave canceled an appearance in Russia earlier this week because of the war and announced that he was "standing by Ukraine and praying that this madness will end soon".
In doing so, the acclaimed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled shows in the invading country.
But in Cave's case, his cancellation message took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet denounced the singer as a hypocrite, as in 2017 he refused to cancel two concerts in Israel, despite much criticism from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to Israel Cave told the local media: "Ultimately, I'm here for two reasons: The first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians".
Ahmet remembered well the statements of Cave in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even posted on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", a snippy post claiming that Israel is also an occupied country, therefore the situation in Palestine is identical to the situation in Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your message on Ukraine", Ahmad wrote, "is that you did not support the Palestinians, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion Israel is primarily responsible for Palestinian suffering.
It saddens me very much, since you represent a double standard here", the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story didn't end there, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmed in a long, detailed letter, in which he stressed that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first scenario is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, hoping to change the entire security order of Europe.
The second situation is a complex friction between two peoples.
Although the conflicts have in common that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I have great sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are and who they are".
Keib added that while he doesn't want to elaborate on his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he definitely supports the Palestinians as well, noting that over the past 20 years there has been a lot of participation in fundraising events on their behalf.
"But this is not the time for arguments, Ahmet", the singer clarified, "it's the time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are now facing a catastrophe on their soil.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians are fiercely opposed to the actions of the Putin regime.
If I could play for them, I would".
In light of the decline in illness, the Corona Projector will return to run Zihu Hospital.
Prof. Salman Zarqa was appointed in July 2021 and led the policy for treatment of the third and fourth wave of Corona
At the request of the Minister of Health, Nitsan Horowitz, will concurrently continue in his role as projector.
Professor Zarka: "Glad that the omicron wave continues to subside, but still it is our duty to prepare for another wave"
I know.
Due to the decline in corona occupancy, the corona projector, Professor Salman Zarqa, will be returning to lead the Zihu Zhu hospital on Sunday.
At the request of the Minister of Health, Nitsun Horowitz, will concurrently continue in his role as projector.
"I am delighted for the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave is continuing to subside and we have received our normal life back", said Prof. Zarqa, adding: "It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of illness stemming from the continued presence of the virus here in Israel and around the world".
Prof. Zarqa was appointed in July 2021 and led the third and fourth wave of coronavirus care policy.
Starting 1 May, Israel returned to the "between-waves" mode, which included the reduction of most of the corona values, while maintaining capabilities to perform sequential tests and investigations, which will be the basis for action in case a new variant is discovered.
Hidden Illness
A report from the National Knowledge and Information Centre on the Corona campaign, released this morning, said that "there has been a drop in the average number of new confirmed cases to below 2,000 per day, a weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized and critically ill patients".
However, they stressed that "there is a significant underlying disease and the actual number of infections is much higher.
The number of institutional tests performed in the community (not including reviews from abroad, MI) is low, averaging less than 20,000 per week alone.
The low scope of testing makes it difficult to identify and understand disease trends".
State Comptroller Report: The actual budget for most years of the Medicare Basket committee  is less than the recommended budget
According to the report by Matthew Engelmann, for more than 20 years of the Hassle activity, the Ministry of Health did not supervise the activities of the committee.
The report also states that the minutes of the meetings are published with substantial delay, if at all.
The evaluator also recommends increasing the transparency of the sub-committee's work and updating the procedures for the work of the basket.
Another deficiency found concerns the fact that since the commission began operation, the Ministry of Health has not asked the hospital funds for reports on the extent of use and utilization of the drugs in the database  which would allow to analyze and control the budget allocated to them.
The Drug Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees in our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new medicines that will be given to the public free of charge through the hospital funds. But a new report by the State Auditor published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without being monitored and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council monitored and investigated its activity.
Israel Today reporter Ren Reznik adds that the state complainant was investigated following Israel Today's ongoing disclosures of drug cartels.
According to the report by Mathieu Engelman, he recommends "reforms and improvements in the expansion of the basket, leading to a better utilization of the health care basket budget to which the public is entitled".
Over the years of the existence of the drug basket supplement mechanism, in the years 2021-1998 drugs were added to the state budget for a total of eight billion NIS, with the supplement moving annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million NIS.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add some 800 new drugs and technologies to the health care basket, with a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated to the expansion of the basket was less than the scope of the requests.
For most of the commission's tenure (90% of the time), the size of the budget surcharge was less than 1.5% of the health care basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired surcharge rate.
The critic points out that the annual supplement needs to be examined and adjusted in order to allow certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that "the transparency model of basket work is lacking".
For example, the ESC's working procedure stipulates that the minutes of meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 160-109 days, while sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in publication of protocols impairs the transparency of decisions; therefore, it may harm the ability of bidders  patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies  to re-apply as soon as is practicable and relevant, after having learnt lessons from their bids that were rejected, analysed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and revised their bids and reevaluated their re-admission to the next round", the reviewer stated in the report.
"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols according to the timeframes established in the protocol".
Out of thousands of submissions, only one economic comment was submitted.
Another criticism of Engelman concerns the preliminary process of assessing technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The reviewer found that half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the postponement.
Another discrepancy concerns the activities of the Medicine Basket subcommittee, which is closed to the media and the public and in which patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The critic recommends attaching a public representative or exploring the possibility of making the discussions public without commercial details that are confidential.
The policy under which the Health Care Board operates is that "a financial assessment must be submitted" for a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic evaluation has been submitted out of thousands of submissions and the commission makes its decisions without a financial evaluation.
For example, the 2021-2019 Basket Committee hearings were requested to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report found that economic calculations were not added to the requests, including an estimate of the amount that could be saved by reducing the harms of obesity-related disease or by being able to avoid gastric bypass surgery.
It also appears that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and evaluation for the treatment of cancer in chronic diseases as targets, but in the framework of decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The critic also warns that since 2011, the medication basket also includes services that are not the responsibility of the hospital funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, given by the Ministry of Health ("The Third Supplement").
That's when the legal framework for this step is only loosely regulated.
For the last six years, NIS 74 million from the pharmacy fund has been used for these services.
Engelmann recommends that the Health Ministry update the basket work protocols and also determine if a separate surcharge is required for these services.
About a third of the new drugs coming into the marketplace are defined as "no-cost drugs", which don't cost the patient extra money because they replace existing treatment.
The critic proposes to study the possibility of these drugs being administered in a different and shorter route, so that the drug basket can be updated several times a year rather than just once a year.
There's no control over the use of very expensive drugs.
The audit also shows that since the Basel Committee started its work 20 years ago, the health ministry hasn't required the health funds to report nor monitored the extent of use and utilization of Basel medicines, information that would have allowed the office to analyze and control the budget allocated to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports relating to the years 2009-2006 were published, and these were also published late (the last one was published in the year and dealt with the use of the budget for the years 2009-2007).
"Delayed testing may result in difficulty in data collection and analysis, the irrelevance of conclusions from testing after such a long period, poor subcommittee evaluation and decisions based on incomplete findings", said the report.
Also, the office doesn't inspect and monitor the use of particularly expensive drugs or conduct sampling.
These 10 drugs accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion NIS in 2021-2016).
On this, the reviewer wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct individual checks on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use versus estimated.
The controls and analysis will enable systematic conclusions to be drawn about the work process of the Basel Committee subcommittee, and how to prepare and improve estimates when pricing drugs and technologies".
"Shocking and Unfathomable": A heated debate in the Health Committee on the poisoning at Defensa
• The first survivor's readings were correct ten minutes before her death.
Committee chairman, H.K. Silman: "If the people there had cared that the kitchen was like home - it wouldn't look like this".
Ten minutes before the first patient, a 40-year-old from the Duphna Home in Halun died of food poisoning, she had been given medical samples that were normal, the director of the home claimed today (Tuesday) in the health committee.
"We have night nurses on duty through the night and a nurse who makes rounds.
There have been several reports of diarrhea and this same tenant was actually the last time she had any measurements 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was on surveillance like all the other Dayakers with diarrhea.
She's an outpatient, we went to get a sedative to help her move, and then the same tenant didn't respond.
We started CPR and called the nurse from the clinic", the shelter director described what happened last Sunday morning in the shelter.
Three residents died, six were hospitalized, and approximately a quarter of the residents (33 out of 131) suffered diarrhea from eating contaminated meat from the guests.
The director of the center said this against the background of the claims that deaths from food poisoning are evidence of neglect and lack of supervision on the part of the caregivers.
Dr. Naema Noss, head of epidemiology for the U.S. Department of Health noted that "we cannot say with certainty what killed the three Heideers.
Only blood tests were taken".
Furthermore, it was discussed that the residents who were hospitalized in the hospital could no longer take a stool sample because it was not in their blood so it was not possible to determine the cause of death and illness with certainty.
Another Ministry of Health engineer noted that "the Ministry of Health inspects the hygiene conditions in institutions' kitchens every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or for license renewal".
The Department of Social Affairs admits that a commission of inquiry has not been appointed for this case and the previous case of abuse of the hidden, which took place three months ago at the Bnei Zion in Sharon.
Chair of the Health Committee, H.E. Edith Silman, said during the debate: "If the people there cared about the kitchen being like home - it wouldn't look like this.
The foster homes need more.
They are health-sensitive and require extra care and attention.
It's shocking and incomprehensible what went on there.
The horrific findings were discovered after they knew the Ministry of Health was coming to check it out.
Where's the oversight and accountability of the offices?
How is it that in a debate like this, the ministers and heads of departments aren't there to explain what is going on here?"
Yigal Nahishtoumi, the CEO of the Eckstein House, who runs the shelter and even ran the shelter, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people all over the place rise with only one purpose: to do good for people.
The people who died were people I took care of personally.
You're one of the flats I put to sleep on my hands.
This is a shocking event for us".
Smudder Oona, a former resident of a foster home of the same age, stormed up to him and said, "Enough of the lies and the pretty words.
I was there".
Gali Barmi, representative of the parents at Akim Israel: "We have complained about the food before and did not accept the criticism".
Oren Hjelmen, founder of the Equal Opportunity Initiative for Integration of Disabled People, protested the fact that the names of the deceased are not published: "Their names are not even known.
Are they worth less?
underestimate the lives of our children".
Suspected of a malfunction in Wolfsson: the surgeon ruptured his heart, and the patient died.
This is the first procedure Dr. Prass Abu Acar has performed as the head of the chest surgery unit at the hospital.
Chairman of the board of doctors complained that the director, Dr. Engel, was warned before his appointment.
Hospital: "He Is Appreciated and Experienced"
First edition: A horrible mistake had been made in Wolfson State Hospital in Holon, when during an operation the doctor performed a tear in the heart of the patient, which led to his tragic death.
The operation on the 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19.
It was the first operation Dr. Prass Abu Akar had performed at the hospital since he was appointed as director of the Chest Surgery Unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, which was intended to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, which led to heavy bleeding and the patient's death.
Except the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, raising some difficult questions about the running of the hospital.
The director of the Cancer Institute and chairman of the Board of Physicians, Dr. Ronen Berner, has demanded an investigation into the matter in a letter to the hospital director, Dr. Anne Engel.
The letter made some very serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Askar after the previous head of the unit, Dr. Benny Zukerman, transferred to Shiba hospital in the town of Bashar.
A Giant Hole in the Heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient has been sober, functioning, and treated by him for the past four years.
He had recently had an outbreak of the disease and found an abnormal accumulation of fluid within the pericardium, within which the heart muscle is.
Also, the surgeon, Dr. Abu Aker, was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, there was a severe malfunction in the operation, and Dr. Haggi Decal, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Wolfson, who was at the time operating on a child in the next room, was "hurried to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart".
He said the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressure was zero, and the surgical approach was flawed.
Also, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu Akr was not professionally or personally suited to manage a thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and despite supposedly being the breast surgeon's direct supervisor, Dr. Engel made a tender without sharing it and accepted Dr. Abu Aqar for the position.
He stated, "This is a simple procedure that takes a few minutes", and added, "The flawed process of appointing Dr. Abu Aker cannot be ignored.
"The question is whether Engel was directly responsible for the failure of the operation and the death of the patient".
An experienced surgeon
Before "Israel Today" information and claims by other senior physicians support the questions raised in the case by Dr. Ronen Brenner were cited.
Dr. Mordecai Shamanov, chief of surgery at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akr was "one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon".
He also added that he was selected in a proper tender and Dr. Deckel did not participate, consistent with his statements about wanting to "disconnect" with the thoracic unit.
He said, "I was not a party to the procedure either, and perhaps I should have been.
Dr. Shamanov wrote that Dr. Phrass Abu Akkar started work on April 10 and that in receiving 100 days of benefits, "all the doctors at the hospital were impressed with his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.
He's done dozens of cases of a similar procedure before, and unfortunately, this case ended as it did.
A statement from Wolfson Hospital said: "We share the family's grief.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The breast surgeon mentioned in the article is a highly respected surgeon with years of experience, and was selected through tender to run the breast surgery unit of the surgical department at Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Haji Decal, his quotes are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who unfortunately was in a very critical condition.
The hospital is looking at the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is aware of the details of the case".

Model for healing: Three senior doctors talk about their mentors
Prof. Galia Raab misses the ingenuity and wisdom of Prof. Marvin Shapira, especially during the pandemic. •
Dr. Shlomi Kudesh does not forget, even from his high office, the push from Prof. Shaul Soknik.
And Dr. Efrat Bron-Herb thanks Dr. Tommy Schinfeld for the lesson in identifying with patients.
Three key people in hospitals write about who inspired them and encouraged them to be better, as caregivers and as people.
Three senior doctors, three teachers of life and profession: On the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, Israel Today invited Prof. Ghaliyah Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kush and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to remember the characters who accompanied them at the beginning of their journey - and helped them become who they are today.
Professor Galia Rahab, head of the infectious diseases unit at Sheba.
On the Professor Marvin Shapira and others.
The Encounter That Opened My Eyes - And Changed My Life
If I hadn't met Professor Marvin Shapira, Sr., who was the director of the infectious disease unit at Hadassah, I probably would have remained an internal medicine physician.
He's the one who got me interested in the field of infectious disease and got me into it.
I met him in the corridors of Hesse, back in the '80s.
For a moment, I didn't think that I would be leaving Internite, because I loved patient care itself; but Professor Shapira showed me that the field of infectious disease was also expressed in neurology, internite, in fact, in all areas.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
All along, I loved his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with all his soul, who loved his patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything thoroughly.
He was a real, honest, selfless man, qualities that I appreciated very much.
At first, when I was asked to choose the doctor who was my role model and greatest influence, I meant to choose my father, Dr. Joseph Rekber, Sr., a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine -- but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.
Both, for example, prompted catchphrases that doctors still use today - such as "Tisu is de persona", in which a biopsy of tissue from an infected organ indicates which drugs to give; or "Whenever you use too much, use too little", which explains that overuse of antibiotics causes the bacteria to become resistant.
Professor Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked in engineering and father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven, I cried.
He was something -- a smart, smart epidemiologist who volunteered for anything.
He never complained, even during his illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the epidemic response team, and he's sorely lacking at this time.
If he was with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted with him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the epidemic response team.

Dr. Shlomi Huzas, the director of the Soroka Hospital.
This is about Professor Saul Sukknick.
A mentor and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors.
I know.
I first met Professor Saul Soucek when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I had a rotation in internal medicine at his Department of Internal Medicine.
I subsequently returned to the department in my sixth year, and I did my medical school thesis under his direction, writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis.
Saul influenced every significant crossroads in my professional life for 20 years, and he was the most significant man in shaping the image of a doctor; not just professionally, but also -- and most importantly -- personally and humanly.
During my internship, I was torn between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted with him about my specialty.
I eventually chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.
During my internship, he provided me with ongoing guidance, in a variety of ways - in scientific writing (sorry, I wasn't as consistent), in dealing with patients, in working with multidisciplinary teams, an area where the department excelled -- and really, every aspect of medicine.
To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and a manager, traits that come from the underworld.
When I finished my residency and was in doubt about going abroad for the internship, Shaul pushed and guided me, and helped me with recommendation letters and advice on how to handle myself.
That recovery period was a very important time in my professional development, and without Saul's support and push, I'm not sure it would have happened.
In return, when I was offered to join the hospital administration, once again Saul was the one who supported and helped.
Then we went through some difficult times together in the Internal Medicine department.
So Saul was able to perfectly integrate teacher, principal, friend, and teammate without his various roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to be as successful as him in this particular combination.
He raised generations of students, interns, and specialists, who today are found throughout the Israeli medical system, perpetuating his memory and works with their excellent work.
It's an honor to be associated with this group.

Dr. Efret Bron-Harleigh, director of the Schneider Children's Medical Center, is here.
This is about Dr. Tommy Shinfeld.
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Schinfeld, founder and former director of the Intensive Care Unit at Schneider Children's, taught me how to be an intensive care physician, but more than that -- he taught me how to think.
The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, sickest children.
Children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who did not imagine that they would be in these complicated situations in the intensive care unit with their children.
It sounds weird, but it goes without saying.
But I learned from him even more meaningful and profound things.
Looking back, because I am a doctor who manages and a director who is a doctor, today I am clear about the connection between the worlds; the education I received from Dr. Schinfeld connects them.
Dr. Schinfeldt taught me to listen very carefully to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurses, to the care teams both young and old, and listen to the parents.
And all of this needs to be done not only to communicate more correctly and more efficiently, but to continually gather the information that can prevent the next downturn.
The motivational processes in pediatric care exist everywhere, and of course in intensive care.
Listening and talking stimulates a deeper understanding, both on the part of the care team and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when you look at an entire system.
The deeper and more rigorous the understanding that exists, the more integrated the dialogue is of all the factors involved, the more precise the decision-making process will be, tailored to the situation, and especially - early enough to prevent future harm, immediate or remote.
This is why Dr. Tommy Shinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He is a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, to listen - and then to apply.

Medical negligence in the various stages of childbirth
To get compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that the damage was caused by the same negligence.
Birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family's life.
Yet, unfortunately, sometimes births end in serious birth or birth-related injuries as a result of the negligence of medical personnel.
In cases where the birth resulted in physical injury to either the child or the mother, there is scope to examine the chain of events that led to the injury and even to consider seeking legal advice.
A medical malpractice lawyer will examine if there were defects in the medical staff conduct at the various stages of birth that caused the injury, and, if deemed appropriate, will consult a medical specialist in the relevant field.
It should be stressed that not every error in care on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily teach that its management was negligent.
When is it negligence?
Where the doctor's error resulted from incompetence or deviation from reasonable care, and the incompetence and deviation from accepted care caused harm to the patient that otherwise would not have been caused by the doctor.
In this article, we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications may occur at each stage, and when they may amount to medical negligence.
Axial phase
The fusion phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.
During this phase, the cervix gradually opens (to allow for the passage of the fetus at birth) and eventually should reach a diameter of about four inches [10 cm].
Most cases of miscarriage involve failure to recognize fetal distress prior to birth, which has resulted in damage to the unborn, sometimes resulting in cerebral palsy.
Paralysis of the brain:
Cerebral palsy can be caused by misidentification or delay in identifying congenital breastfeeding, which is manifested as failure to deliver oxygen to the fetal brain tissue.
In general, monitoring the condition of the newborn, and proper deployment of the fetal heart monitor should lead to early detection of developing fetal distress, allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreversibly harmed.
Cases where the medical staff ignore signs of oxygen deprivation in the fetus or do not correctly interpret the data in it, especially the fetal monitor, or respond with delays to the distress displayed on the monitor  may be negligence.
Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a dislocated umbilical cord as well as an undetected uterine tear.
Even in these extreme events, it's worth asking whether the medical team acted properly.
For example, Anna Reiff Liganza, an attorney with the law firm of Crouch & Co. specializing in representing medical malpractice victims, explains that her office handled a child who was injured during birth after a midwife blocked the amniotic sac when the fetal head was too high, resulting in the fall of the umbilical cord (when the umbilical cord is in advance of the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (caused by pressure from the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and his child being born with severe neurological damage.
In another case, a lawyer testified that her office filed a complaint for gross medical negligence against the staff of the maternity ward of a large hospital who during the delivery failed to identify on time obvious signs which prompted a genuine suspicion that the newborn had suffered a rupture of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of the previous pregnancy.
The fetus that escaped through the rift in its mother's uterus to the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until its late discharge when it was on the verge of death.
Due to severe fetal distress during his birth, the child was born with a complex neurological disability.
We insist, that in order to win damages, the plaintiffs prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal relationship between the negligence of the medical staff which led to the failure to identify the lactating woman and the damage to the newborn, which means that the damage was caused by said negligence and not by any other cause or factor.
Causal association analysis will be performed by examining medical parameters whose existence is the only one in the medical literature that provides a causal link between the concussion and the brain injury.
Among other things, the fetus' blood acidity measurements, its blastocyst scores, the presence of neurological and systemic damage, and more.
Death of the fetus
The active stage of labor
The active stage of labor begins when the cervix opening reaches four inches in diameter and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical phase.
Birth defects and the avoidance of cesarean section
In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, a lack of progress of the active birthing process.
In such cases, it is customary to perform a Caesarean section, in order to prevent various possible injuries to the fetus due to delayed delivery.
"In some cases, failure to perform a C-section on time could cause irreversible damage to the fetus", explained lawyer Reiff-Ligonza.
"For example, we had a medical malpractice claim for the death of her infant caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.
Contrary to all known medical practice, the medical staff was not trained to recognize fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the operation caused extensive systemic damage to Lilouda which eventually led to her death shortly after birth".
Negligence in the birth of a vacuum
In situations where the mother or fetus is exposed to significant danger that requires a particularly rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.
This process involves attaching a vacuum dome to the fetus' head and forcibly pulling the fetus out.
Naturally, this involves dangers that can cause harm to both the fetus and the child. It requires great care, precision, and skill.
In these events, medical malpractice may be manifested in the fact that the doctor does not follow the mandatory instructions and carries out the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or carries out the operation for too long, or when despite the failure of several attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more than the number of attempts allowed.
In these cases if the negligent vacuum operation has caused birth defects - among others it could have resulted in brain damage and bleeding that may have resulted in the development of brain damage - there is room for a claim for damages.
Paralysis on the ERB name
Paralysis after birth, here is congenital nerve damage in the cervical spine, when it occurs during childbirth, it's worth checking to see if the damage was due to the negligence of the delivery team.
The injury manifests in weakening of the muscles of the hand and can extend to complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in delivering the newborn due to a "breech disorder" - a birth emergency that occurs when the fetus's shoulders become trapped inside the birth canal after its head is released.
When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the weight of the fetus is assessed as macrosome, meaning it is expected to weigh more than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) at birth and in accordance with the guidelines, it is better to deliver the mother via cesarean delivery.
When the birth weight is over 10 pounds, a C-section should be considered in light of the risk factors including gestational diabetes and prolonged stage two labor.
In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal fetal weight or other risk factors and opts for a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder dislocation and ERB-related paralysis becomes a reality, there is a strong possibility of medical negligence.
Indeed, in H.R. 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk of shoulder dislocations occurring during childbirth may be predicted with varying degrees of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder dislocations when they are suspected is by cesarean section".
The stage of the placenta
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to uterine contractions after the child's exit and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process usually lasts up to half an hour after the baby is delivered and occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the discharge, the medical team will check to see if she's out safely or if any parts of her placenta are left in the uterus.
At this stage, complications can occur that could cause serious damage to the fetus.
One of the most common complications of an absent cervix is known as "Ashman's syndrome" or a uterine laceration that results from inflammation caused by an absent cervix, which damages the lining of the uterus in a way that prevents pregnancy.
So in cases where the medical team failed to identify that the remains remained or failed to take all necessary steps to prevent cervical mutilation despite a suspicion of the remnants in the uterus, this could be a case of medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer.
Death in childbirth
The death of a mother during childbirth is a fairly rare occurrence.
In these cases, the event that should have brought happiness and joy to the family turns, sadly, into the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical staff fails to detect bleeding in the birth mother at the time or responds late to the bleeding.
"For example", explained lawyer Raef-Lignanza, "our office has filed a lawsuit concerning the death of a newborn, in which the medical team ignored and failed to respond to the distressing vital signs of the newborn for several hours after a diagnosis of a massive, uncontrollable bleed occurring as a known complication of her underlying condition".
"In another case", said Attorney Reif-Ligonza, "our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding from an improperly sutured c-section.
In the same case, the woman complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical team did not address her complaints and her clinical condition adequately, responding delayed only after her body systems had begun to collapse, which led to her death".
Loss of uterus
In severe cases, medical negligence in childbirth may lead to a hysterectomy. Attorney Rafe Lingiza says: "Our law firm sued a hospital that performed a hysterectomy due to medical negligence after birth.
In that case, the delivery woman, a young woman of 31, lost her uterus due to inadequate treatment of the massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after childbirth and yet not taken timely actions that could prevent the damage".
What are the damages awarded for medical malpractice at birth?
Maternity compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being awarded for pain and suffering, nursing and salaried care, loss of salary and pension for the injured and even for his parents and other damage components.
The compensation to the injured minor for lost wages and pension is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.
Also, the compensation includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation equipment, the cost of accommodation for the baby's needs, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation was determined in any case for his body and according to his circumstances", said attorney Reif-Ligenza, adding that "today most medical malpractice claims are settled in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in conducting the procedure", but added that "there are cases where the proceedings end only in a verdict, after which if the case is not dismissed the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damage and for example, in a case conducted by our office, the district court ruled that a youngster who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in treatment will receive compensation in excess of ten million shekels".
In conclusion
Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.
In these cases proper legal examination of the chain of events that led to the tragic outcome, by a lawyer trained in handling medical malpractice claims, can help you get the compensation you deserve.
It's the reason for the prevalence of keratoconus eye disease in the South.
Research has suggested that there is a connection between the development of the disease and consanguineous marriages
The highest incidence was found in the Bedouin sector.
Expert: "It may be that in any area with a lot of cousin marriage there is a high incidence of the disease".
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It's very important to diagnose it early, and find the right solutions to prevent it from getting worse.
In recent years, some studies have been conducted to understand how the disease develops, and new treatments have been developed.
The new research gives scientific basis to suspect that Keratoconus eye disease is a genetic disease.
A recent study of the transformation of the cornea from dome to cone found that the cause of corneal disease, and of corneal weakness and deformation, is related to an enzyme imbalance, whereby free radicals can damage corneal proteins and change the structure of the cornea.
The source of that enzyme deficiency is genetic, a fact that supports the hypothesis that keratoconus is an inherited disorder.
According to Prof. Ariyal Gordon-Shag, head of the Department of Optometric Sciences at the Hassa Academic College, "In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, the prevalence of keratoconus was found to be 3.2%.
The highest prevalence was among students from the Bedouin sect - 20% had karatokonos, but there was a relatively small sample".
The researcher added that it is not a surprising finding: "Cartoconus is widespread in the Bedouin community.
In our studies, we found that close marriages are a risk factor for cartoconus.
So in any sector with a lot of cousin marriages, you may find a high incidence.
In this context it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unambiguous conclusion: In cases where a family history of keratoconus disease appears, all family members should undergo an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.
According to Erza Procter, a B.Sc. clinical optometrist, "there is ten times more clinical outreach from the peripheral areas, especially from the south, than the center".
Proctor adds that "Over the last decade, I have noticed that most of the patients are moving away from the periphery, especially the Beersheba area.
This is mainly due to high rates of inter-family marriage (mostly in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of the correct treatment of the problem".
So how do you diagnose the disease?
Prokter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or late teens (ages 16-15, or 20).
This disease involves a decrease in vision, parallel to an increase in the cylinder.
Cartoon-conus patients exhibit distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and bones.
These signs get worse with the progression of the disease, which often develops slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease can also progress rapidly and reach a peak in just a few months.
Many of the patients even report increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza, the IDF revealed the name of the soldier. Bennett: "Now, the people know the face of a hero of Israel".
Mahmoud Khair-e-Din from Khurfis village is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in action in Khan Younis.
Head of UN: "He, his family and his children deserve publicity"
Next we'll discuss the possibility of publishing the photograph of Lt. Col. Emanuel Moreno patroling from the C.C.
Three and a half years after the operation that went wrong in Khan Yunis, the IDF today announces that the soldier killed in the action, Corporal M, is Corporal Mahmoud Khire a-Dine Zul-I-L from the village of Khurfis in the north.
41-year-old was in his fall.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "It has been three and a half years since Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hire al-Din Jr. was killed in action in a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now we are allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and devotion to the security of the state.
"Mahmoud Zell was a paratrooper and later rose through the ranks to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's Special Operations Battery.
A hero of Israel who was posthumously decorated with the "Shadow of the Chief of Staff"
He said: "I spared him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, his name and face of Israel's hero, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Hire Al-Din, openly.
The environment had its eye on him.
Since that operation, the IDF has banned the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion the head of the intelligence branch, general Aharon Haliwa, held with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and photo.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, a national hero of Israel, was born on 28 December 1977 in the village of Chorfis in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmad and a nun, and has seven brothers and sisters.
He is the Druze Witness.
Was married to Nahad and father of two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and special operations field commander in the Intelligence branch.
All his life, Khair ad-Din was a social leader, and the community looked up to him.
He attended school in Khorepish village until the tenth grade, and then went to the military boarding school at the Royal School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he enlisted in the paratroopers, and in 2000 he graduated from the officers school.
In 2002, he was identified by the U.S. Special Forces Command and transferred to the NRA.
During his service, he completed a bachelor of laws degree at the College of Administration and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002, he met his wife, Naheed, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, during which he and his friends formed an association that promotes Druze witnessing in Israel.
In 2010 he joined the NGO Other and began coaching a group in the village of Khorpis, after he made sure that the association was going to work in the Druze villages to encourage young men to enlist.
In 2013 his second son was born.
The head of the MNA, Colonel Harun Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "This is the time we turn to the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair-e-Din, the hero of Israel.
We've completed work and concluded there's no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.
He deserves it too, for his family and his children", he said.
"Exceptional Educator and Leader"
"Because of his many exploits, he is no less a hero in my eyes", said the champion of Haliua.
"He has made a significant contribution, filled with courage and coolness, to the State of Israel.
He deserves to get his rightful place".
And he added: "I didn't know him personally, but he was an extraordinary educator, educator and leader - not just on the operational side, but also in my values".
The colonel mentioned that he would also consider later whether to publish the picture of another hero, Col. Emanuel Moreno from the General Staff, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose picture was not allowed to be published.
The operation in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of meticulous preparation involving the intelligence community.
The command group for this operation was the then Chief of Staff, Colonel Gaddi Aysencot, the head of the Army Intelligence Service then, General Tamir Heyman and the then Chief of the General Staff, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not been made public, and the IDF has stressed that this is an unprecedented intelligence operation.
But the Arab media featured the discovery of communications equipment the Palestinians say was left behind by the forces behind.
According to Hamas, the operation was to jam the wiretaps.
According to public records, on the day of the incident, the force was traveling in two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint set up by Hamas men, and something about their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The field interrogation lasted about 45 minutes, during which time she became more and more aggressive.
When the force realized he was in trouble, Colonel Khair a-Din managed to distract the Hamas men, and in a split second the commander of the force, Colonel A, opened fire.
The fire killed three Hamas members, and sadly, also Lt. Col.
Ten months after the hard event, the Chief of Staff, Aviem Chouhebi, decided to accept the recommendation of the CSC and to award the CSC to three of the fighters involved in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip - including General Khair E. Deen Jr.
The commander of the fighting force and another member of the team were also awarded the Medal of Honor.
The Army said then that Sgt. M received the medal "for his participation in the operation with his squad, in enemy territory, with determination, courage and courage, to protect his comrades".
He subsequently acted with initiative and undermined contact, taking a leading role in the take-over of the enemy and worked diligently to promote the conquest.
Consider moving from a small operation to a large operation.
Israel should ask itself, again, whether it is right to change policy in the face of Jenin's cut
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and burn up the West Bank in its wake, but the Jenin gunmen may not have left her any choice.
This stormy weekend has taught us that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the ground is still constantly boiling.
Many efforts and good sense will be needed to get through the next two commemorations - Nakba Day today and Jerusalem Day two weeks from today - safely.
Quite a few elements will stand in the way of attempting to bring her back to sanity.
In the lead, as always, are the terrorist elements, who are making a special effort to maintain the violent atmosphere of recent weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which a MFA fighter, R.S.B. Naim Rizz Zl., was killed the day before.
Fighters who fought at the battle of Jenin testified that they could not recall such a scale of gunfire and violence - testimony not only to the enormous amount of ammunition in the area, but to the willingness to use it.
This forces Israel to ask itself, again, whether it is wrong to change policy in the face of the Genin Strip, and move from small, intelligence-based Finzeta operations to a large, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and then set on fire the entire West Bank and the whole arena; even now, the security system prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid arson, but the Jenin gunmen may leave it with no choice.
Draw lessons for future events.
Riz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims that it intentionally killed Al-Jazeera journalist Shirin Abu Akhla.
An operational activity is a dangerous thing for those who participate in it and those on the scene.
The military takes enormous risks for its forces to avoid harm to innocents as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of fighters.
It's about high ethics, but it also has operational intelligence value: a terrorist captured alive - as happened yesterday in Jenin - is an excellent source of intel on plots, attacks, and other terrorists; it is information that rarely can be obtained in any other way, and it can be used to thwart future attacks.
The IDF was right when it published yesterday an interim report into the death of Abu Aqaba, and made it clear that it's impossible to determine at this point who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful that a definite bottom line can be reached in the matter.
Still, it seems nothing will convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without having to balance this by a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terror - the original reason why the IDF is working tirelessly in Jenin.
As always, the nature of such stories is to perish.
World public opinion is preoccupied with her and going on, certainly as the war in Ukraine continues to rage on an even more intense scale.
Therefore, it's a shame that Israel insisted on giving the Abu Aqal death case further unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if the family did not agree with the preliminary conclusions, one should have expected a little more eloquence from the police accompanying the funeral procession, and certainly less to be overcome by the Palestinian flags flying there.
Responsibility: to act to calm the situation.
Well done to the Minister of Homeland Security and the Commissioner of Police for ordering an investigation into this incident.
He appears to have lacked adequate preparation and clear instructions, but it's troubling the fact that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different counties.
Also in the Dizengoff attack, the police failed to manage the event, isolate the scene, and handle the media.
The board of inquiry would do well not only to analyze the conduct of the officers at the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions that could make more successful handling of similar incidents in the future.
Besides internal police care, he also undertakes to give an opinion on the conduct of elected public officials who have lost their way.
There are currently several members in the Knesset who pose a threat to democracy.
They're on the left and the right, and they use their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
AKOF Kaseif is the latest example of this; if no action is taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the state will implicitly encourage the next elected official to further police his actions.
Such actions, which are part of defensive democracy, are vital in the explosions of this period, when in the background there are elements who want to exploit the situation for political interests.
Anyone with any sense is expected to rise above it all and work to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel could quickly slip into an escalation in the face of enemies from beyond, and worse, enemies at home.
Senior police officer: "This requires government policy and targeting"
Israeli police have launched an operation to eliminate the phenomenon of illegal immigrants, but there is still a long way to go.
"There is no single factor in the State of Israel today that encompasses all of that.
"If we want to address the phenomenon of illegal residents, we need government policy, and we need to weed out goals and tasks and responsibilities.
"There is no single factor in the State of Israel that covers this whole issue", a senior police official told Israel Today.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation of the security situation, the phenomenon was manifested in the 20 to 30 thousand people who entered daily through the breaches in the fence.
In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel daily to work through 34 controlled crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six Day War, and the number of permits in each branch is limited to the amount determined by the diplomatic rank depending on the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Department.
In light of this, the hospital is not necessarily a Palestinian barred from entering for criminal involvement or connection with terrorism, but in many cases they are Palestinians banned from entering because they do not meet the permit amount.
It should be stressed that those who carried out the attacks on Ariel, Dizengoff and Balad were considered to be SDF, but they were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offence that required the security forces to monitor their movements.
"So there is no meaning to their entry through breaches in the fence", says a senior security official. "Those who want to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled crossings, and there have been such cases before.
Thousands Arrested
Following the attack in Aledo and in light of the multiple threat alerts, the police have launched a massive operation to find illegal aliens.
By the end of the week, 16,000 workers had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and prosecuted, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to police prosecution policy, unlawful detention proceedings are only conducted against would-be criminals or repeat offenders (recidivists).
An illegal stay arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes it happened a second time, but it was not until the third time that he was arrested, imprisoned, and charged with being illegal.
According to the law, if an illegal stay is apprehended within 50 to 100 yards of either side of the separation wall, it is dealt with by military prosecution.
Data obtained by Israel Today shows that in 2021, 40,010 illegal residents, drivers, and migrants were dealt with by the police.
7,405 illegal residents were arrested and 19,533 criminal cases were opened.
The number of employers, drivers, and sailors treated by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
'The foundations of the SHAP phenomenon do not depend on the police, the IDF, nor the Israeli society or the Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors", says a senior law enforcement official.
To address the phenomenon, we have to stifle their motivation to work in Israel, and the Israeli side must charge them a price that prevents them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the matter claim that the non-payment of the price stems, among other things, from the lack of facilities and the fact that arrests are only made for accompanying offenses or when there is a serial rapist.
Legal sources claim the decision to charge a price for his third arrest was made partly because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests being made every day.
"Whoever examines the punishment also, will find that it is not deterrent".
There's a great complexity.
"The suspect", says a police source, "is a complicated man".
He could be a family man who went to the country to work to earn a few shekels and come back.
It's the basic platform, and on this platform you dress up a lot of types of terrorists who are coming into the country to commit crimes or attacks".
A stroke can be major or minor.
In the past, 16-year-old illegal immigrants have been caught by the police, and even children aged 8 and 10 are sent by their parents to crossroads to earn a few shekels a day.
"It also makes things difficult, because in these cases we have to bring in the parents and charge them with neglect", says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical jobs or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities who employed garbage collectors, mainly in the north.
Of the 34 crossings, there are about 18 major crossings.
There are crossings for vehicles and goods, there are crossings that only people pass, and there are crossings that are both.
All the crossings are controlled by the IDF and the transit authority.
The aliens are usually driven into the country by private drivers, so it's easy money.
"There are those who do this for a living, and there are gangs whose main business is the transportation of Jews", says a senior police officer, "usually mostly Arab Israelis, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can go up to 100 shekels to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies don't do that, because if the company is caught, it's doomed".
Police emphasise that under certain circumstances, transporting a patient to a hospital can be a criminal offence.
"A taxi driver, working with licenses in accordance with the license and insurance, who collects Palestinians at regular points and at regular hours, including regular reservations, does not break the law", says a senior police officer, "who knows he is travelling to the hospital, usually collects them at night in hidden places, including unloading at hidden points".
Most of these guys drive in a Chewbacca because they know they're going to be impounded, so they'd rather drive the old car".
Documentary: Field fires in a bird's seat
The area is suffering from numerous fires, with damage amounting to tens of thousands of shekels.
It was at this point that the New Guard was established in an attempt to stamp out the hard-won phenomenon of the dark ages.
I know.
Documentation obtained by Israel Today shows grazing areas in the seat of the burning birds.
The pasture lands are owned by the Zilbermans.
The area has suffered many fires, with damage amounting to tens of thousands of shekels.
It should be noted that it was at this juncture that the New Guard was formed in an attempt to stamp out the evil.

Terrorists unleashed charges at IDF soldiers, who returned fire, killing one of their own.
Security forces arrested 13 wanted men across Judea and Samaria tonight.
During the operation, the IDF fired at several suspects who threw rounds at them. A casualty was identified.
The director of the Jenin hospital that the terrorist was addressing, Maher Merai, 25, from Jenin, reports that he was shot by IDF fire.
IDF, RC and FEMA forces arrested 13 wanted men throughout Judea and Samaria.
The forces operated in several locations throughout the Judea and Samaria governorate to arrest wanted persons, including in the village of Rashida and the town of Shkem.
In the activity of the fighters in the city of Jenin, in the area of the Manisha Air Brigade, two wanted suspects were arrested on suspicion of terrorist activity.
In addition, during the operation, the IDF fired at several suspects who threw charges at them, and shooting was heard in space.
We have a hit.
The director of the Jenin hospital who was approached by the terrorist, Maher Murray, 25-year-old from the Jenin refugee camp, reports that he was shot by IDF fire, which led to his death.
During the operation of IDF fighters in the Al-Aza refugee camp in the area of the territorial division for the arrest of a wanted suspect in a terrorist activity and seizure of weapons, several suspects were identified throwing stones towards the force, which responded with means to disperse the demonstrations and Roger's fire.
We have a hit.
In addition, arrests were made in the village of Silwad, east of Ramallah, and three students from the "Qatlah-u-Aslamiya", the Hamas-affiliated list at the Anjaah University in Najd, which recently recorded violent clashes with Fatah students and security forces on the campus, were held in their homes.
"A criminal investigation should be opened against her": the mayor is defending serious allegations against the Cliché Roatham eye
A city inspector's report presents suspicion of alleged criminal conduct by Dr. Inat Klish Rutham against former city officials and political rivals: employee trackers and an inflated payment to an accountant's office for conducting investigations.
"The harsh findings of the report warrant a criminal investigation".
There was no response from the City of Haifa.
Tracking down city employees and political opponents, and a huge fee to an accounting firm for conducting the probe, "at the expense of the public purse".
A report from the Haifa Municipal Inspectorate published yesterday (Tuesday), raises the fears of alleged criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Inat Kalish Rotam against former municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
According to the suspect, Kalish met with the accounting firm at Rabb & Co. and requested an audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former city treasurer, and a code name given to the council's company Sofi Nakash, and we examined whether the tenders between the city and a company owned by Nakash's family were authentic to Hadrin.
The auditor's report also indicates that there is a complete disorder and lack of control over the accountant's work with whom she met a cliché.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose function is to centralize and synchronize between the work of the accountant and the municipal departments and the data collected by the accountant not transferred to it.
That meant that no one in the town was aware of all the projects being undertaken by the accountant, and how much work is required in each of them.
Moreover, the hourly reports submitted by the accountant were not certified in many cases as required.
There was a situation where the scope of matters in which the accountant was involved increased disproportionately, with great interference in the normal running of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring from the municipality.
In the summary of the report, the audit recommended that the pending payments to the auditor be halted until material detailing his work in each of the fields examined is received.
Further, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were under codes like "Borderguard", an information store, a fish shop, the investigative review of the mayor and an investigative review report.
Soon after, a city clerk, Attorney Emmett Klein, noted that the mayor had personally signed the payment authorization in her place.
"not invited by any review report and I have no idea what it is", she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigation investigation is about two million shekels out of which one and a half million shekels have been paid and about half a million shekels remain to be paid from the tax money of the civil society.
Former city treasurer Jackie Wakim responded: "These vile activities that were intended to smear the reputations of elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the hidden taxpayer, are a criminal offense".
Sophy taunted the city councilwoman in response, "The inspector's report and the commission's recommendations speak for themselves".
Haifa City Council member Shrit Gulen's lawyer response: "The evidence and the hard findings arising from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the hiring of the investigative review consultant to conduct investigations, some of whom he doubts are legitimate because of the manner in which they were carried out and specifically the investigations concerning the opposition council to the mayor and former senior employees".
A comment by Lior Dutch of the "Border Guards" organization: "It seems like all the red lines were crossed that a public authority sends investigators to collect information against lawyers representing an organization that exposes corruption and when appointed by the director of public proceedings against the Haifa City administration".
The city of Haifa has not responded.
Judah Barlev accounting firm does not wish to comment.
Gantz revealed, "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to undermine UNIFIL operations in Lebanon".
The Minister of Defense attended an international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel knows the rivals' cyber systems and their modes of operation".
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Al-Sayed's captivity to Hamas: "a video aimed at blackmail on the back of a humanitarian issue".
The deputy commander of 8200 revealed: "We have foiled an attempt to poison the water systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz addressed an international cyber conference of the Cyber Center at the University of Tehran in Lebanon, where he exposed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on Lebanese civilians and the stability of the country", Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentary of Hamas captive Hisham al-Sayed, who was released by the terrorist organization's military wing: "Yesterday, a video was published with the aim of blackmailing  on the basis of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four boys in violation of international law, in violation of morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and we expect the international community to take action against this criminal behavior of Hamas".
He added that "the State of Israel is operating with a variety of means, and continues to turn every stone in order to bring the boys home.
As we've said before, this is a humanitarian issue, this is how we see it, and on this basis we will continue to act.
Extortion attempts and mind games will not affect our attitudes and conduct".
He then revealed the joint activity of Iran and Hezbollah: "Iran is also using its proxies in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recently the activity of the Iranian security services in cooperation with Hezbollah was detected, in order to hurt the activities of the UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This by carrying out a cyber operation intended to steal materials from Unifor's facilities in space, and use them by Hezbollah.
This is another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the Lebanese people, and the stability of Lebanon".
"Israel knows its opponents' cyber systems and their operating methods.
We've seen in recent years a phenomenon of Iranian hacking groups, which are operating against Israel and other countries", Gantz continued.
"'The new shipments, are terrorists with a keyboard that fights like other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we're hitting them and their messengers, and even today they're in our sights - and not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack on Israeli civilians will be on the agenda today.
And the responsibility is on the attackers and the state that funds and sends them.
A cyberattack can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and beyond".
Gantz went on to attack the nuclear power: "Iran leads cyber terrorism and makes moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened with the US presidential election and other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Activities by the Shahid Khawa unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were done under the direct direction of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards as revealed in the investigations".
He also added that "in recent years we have thwarted many attempts to break into private and public companies, at home and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber accountability' and punish companies and bodies that do not follow the guidelines".
Gantz went on to outline Israel's next goals in the face of threats: "Our top-level mission, in the military, in industry and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, to train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have made this a priority for the relevant units.
We're looking at the power building all the time -- both in terms of manpower, both in terms of training, and also in terms of the tasks.
In the coming years we will also have to examine the form of organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, on its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system".
Finally, the Minister of Defense summed up and called for cooperation with the world: "There is great importance to our cooperation with the world against Iran also in the cyber dimension.
The same partnerships that we are building in the region with Iran in terms of defending against different threats we are expanding in the cyber dimension as well".
The deputy commander of the 8200 revealed, "We have foiled an attempt to poison the water systems".
Uri, deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit's first public appearance at a conference of this kind, revealed that Israel could attack the water systems.
"Disabling cyber threats is a core part of our business.
Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and take action to negate his skills", said the deputy commander 8200, adding, "so sometimes we also find victims outside of Israel, and then we contact other agencies if needed.
We do this both independently and by collaborating with industry and other agencies, through the application and use of tools that we've developed.
The 8200 will not rest until the threat is removed".
As mentioned above, the threat to Israel's water systems and the attempts to poison Israeli citizens was revealed: "We thwarted an attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them a few years ago.
In another case we also identified that a certain adversary had attacked Israel and in so doing we identified that same attacker who also attempted to target U.S. power plants.
That was the first indication of this attack.
We have managed to avert this threat by working closely with our American partners".
This is how the police are trained to take out terrorists in the civilian population.

A look at the Assaf facility
Preparing for the Next Attack: A series of terrorist attacks in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs that killed 19 people and wounded some 70 civilians led the Border Guard to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to storm terrorists inside a civilian population and fire into traffic.
Exposing Israel Today: A look at the Assaf facility
Popular terrorism focuses on civilian harm and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary for the normal life of a civilian population.
The wave of violent attacks this year, with the attacks on the beaches at Bair Sheva, Badra, Bani Bark, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on Dizengov Husen Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist embedded in the crowd, has led the police to think creatively about the need to develop tools that could train fighters to attack terrorists in a civilian population.
The thinking was led by the Police and Border Guard training wing.
These were competed in the various police districts under the title "Leading Learning Commanders", where each district was required to develop tools to help improve the police and combat skills of the warriors, police and commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need for training MIB combatants to engage in shooting in motion and descriptions of this kind, Assaf Ben David, a terrorism instructor at the Jerusalem Area MIB developed the "Assaf System", which is composed of a dynamic target, attached to a telescopic pole on which consists of a projectile that can be attached to the instructor.
Their servant guides the bearer of our death, he can train the warrior before him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It will be noted that in recent years, Border Guard troops and militants have faced numerous attacks in which the attacker fires a shot and poses a threat while moving across areas teeming with innocent civilians.
A collection system, in its current form, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the upgraded telescopic rod that's being integrated into the facility has been removed from the maintenance and cleaning area.
The device allows simulating firing in motion in a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the target, handling motion stop, selecting a path of progression, and performing selective firing including the practice of avoiding casualties to non-involved people.
The RAF commander Assaf Ben David, after whom the facility is named says: "The facility we have developed is a breakthrough in the training of soldiers and police.
Development, gives a relevant response to the threats posed and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefits in development versus the relatively low cost of production gives us a significant competitive advantage".
"Central Election Commission is not prepared for cyber threats"
Metanyah Engelman warned at International Cyber Week against Israel's lack of preparedness for hacker attacks
"World War III will be a hacker war but the world is not ready for it".
State visitor Mattanyah Engelman participated today (Wednesday) in the annual cyber conference of Tel Aviv University and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
"We are exposed.
Our data is exposed to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it".
Angelman said that cyber audits conducted by his office found significant flaws: "In the last year, we have carried out penetration checks in the traffic management center in Jerusalem, hospitals and tax authority systems.
And the inspections found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were done by public agencies, and some of them only did penetration tests during the inspection.
In addition, deficiencies in the Central Election Commission's preparedness for cyber threats".
"We in the State Comptroller's office are committed to continuing to address this significant issue more fully, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world", he concluded.

You're off the team for four years, how excited are you to be back, and how much you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to enjoy the team and I come in the attitude of contributing whatever I can, whether it's from my experience or whether it's on the pitch.
Of course I'd love to play, but when it comes to the team, everyone has to put their egos aside and do everything they can to make the team succeed.
I'm here for what they need from me".
You are now 14 players, and the European Championships will be joined by Dani Abadia, Gaby Chacchashville will return, and there may be some more changes as well.
Do you have a goal to be on the championship team?
"I'd be happy to be on the field and contribute".
Blazer, 29, has spent the last two seasons with the Texans.
When the season was over, it was clear he wasn't going to continue in yellow and after a few weeks, he went to beer, preferring the Jerusalemites over the sickly worker.
You had other offers, why did you choose the Jerusalem verb?
"They showed a very great willingness for me to be there, so it was a relatively easy negotiation.
Once I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I knew this was the right place for me.
The situation seems good and appropriate to me as well.
I'm here to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I spoke to the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and winning, and that's exactly what I'm bringing.
I've always loved playing in the arena, because I get energized as well with the crowd against me, and now that they're on my side it'll be even better.
I am sure it will be a committed and fun group, and I wanted to be a part of it".
Explain a little more about your conversation with Coach DeGicchitz.
"Professionally he believes in a lot of ballless movement, he plans to bring in good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intensive team.
He believes in high energy offense, defense, and with the crowd in the arena, it can work".
I've looked at your career and I've seen that every team stays at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel that you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
"Everywhere I go, I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone hasn't stopped ringing and beeping.
I got a lot of messages waiting for me.
So I believe we have a good time ahead of us".
Do you think Jerusalem could be a more significant player than the TSA?
How do you sum up your two years in the TSA?
"I'm afraid there were things out of my control this past season.
Everyone saw that I stayed professional all the way through, and no matter how much I got, I always gave it my all.
I'm proud of the way I did it last year, and now everybody's going their own way".
If it were up to you, would you want to stay in Macbay?
"After the last year, it was clear to both parties that we were heading towards a breakup, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season, I got a little bit hurt in the minutes and my rating went down, although I had a very good season in the middle of the year, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized it was less of a place for me.
Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it".
In closing, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the cup semi-final last season when I shouted to the Betts people 'That's why I'm here, so that's why I came to Jerusalem  to take degrees.' "
Wade Baldwin may be joining the TSA.
The Yellow have been making contact with a Baskonia star last season and are hoping to join him to complete the backline ahead of the 2022/23 season.
Are the TSA cops on their way to buy a shimmer?
Guard Wade Baldwin may join the Yellow and complete the back line of the Boosters for the 2022-23 season.

Both Rafi Manko and Josh Nibo have closed and are expected to officially sign soon.
Adam Ariel will move to Tel Aviv?
The Reds would like to sign the 27-year-old forward if he is released from active duty.
• Man may be borrowed to the neighbors of Zion Miracle
Jerusalem has decided not to exercise the option of Retin Obasuhan.
Tel Aviv operative is exploring the possibility of joining Adam Ariel if he is released from Jerusalem operative.
As a reminder, a few days ago we reported that the 27-year-old forwards' future at the Jerusalem club is in doubt and that the team might consider extending his contract when a final decision is made in the very next few days.
It now appears that if he does not continue in the brewery, the TSA will try to sign him into her ranks.
In Jerusalem, the club's board decided not to exercise the option on Retin Obasuhan's contract for another season and announced his release from the team.
In the meantime, Adam Gardez may be loaned to Miracle Zion after asking to leave the Reds to get more playing time.

All or nothing: 1:1 between Jerusalem and Hadrama
Guy Châtidé scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but managed to correct with a draw after 10 minutes.
Later, the link is removed in questionable red (74) •
Hadera also remained in the ten players following the red line of duty of Ido Levi (87)
The professional team of the Jerusalem Evening Book (JBK) well-counted the number of strangers on the grass field, much more than once, it should be noted, and at one point they even found one player less (Gia Hadid has been eliminated).
This time, to their delight, all was well, and the 1:1 they had won against Hadera would not be taken away from them by the union tribunal.
Before Red absorbed the sympathy, he managed to capture an own goal and tie to set up a precious point for Zi Zi.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadid's private show began.
FlexoChenko backed up to wide, and the connection rose up and bounced back and the ball stopped in his team's net.
0:1 for a room that enjoyed the self-portrait of the relationship.
Ten minutes after the self-portrait, Hadida managed to fix it, and the giant LeBokovich took a breath and this time the connection was drained into the correct network.
One on one, Betty.
In the 74th minute, Khadija also managed to score a second yellow and red, this time after slipping in the direction of Marmantini.
Daniel Bar Nathan decided on a questionable red and sent the link straight to an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Nathan sent both Adeedou and Levi in red and evened the match on the grass.
Eel has defeated Cholon.
It is 60:85.
The team of Ariel Beitel has recorded its third victory in a row, this time particularly impressive.
Hoover and Sachman (15 C.P.A.) excelled
Eilet's comeback continues tonight with an impressive 60-85 victory over Holon en route to an 0-3 seasonal tie in meetings between the two.
Since falling to last place, Ariel Beit Hallami's team has won three straight, and really it's only a surprise for those who haven't seen the game.
We haven't seen such a bad disease in a long time.
All this before the series opener against Shikesh on Pline in the Cup Championship: only 60 points, first half three-for and 11 percent for three for the entire game.
On the bottom line, a very unimpressive evening for all the players in the team (except Murphy Manco, who hit all three of Cholon's triplets), including safe stock Chris Johnson.
Eilat, on the other hand, is in much better shape thanks to Huber and Joaquin Schockman.
One of them came back in the last period, the other was back in the bloom, and also amazing with a three-quarter basket.
Give them a chance: The Israelis from the THA rescued Spartakoplus
After losing the Derby and eight in a row in Europe, a defeat against Jerusalem in the Clasico - would apparently have ended the long affair between the Tirana scouts and the Greek coach -
So who does Janis have to send flowers to tonight?
For his Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points in the Arena
And also: why the Yellow Club should change their 'Americanization strategy', and take a living example from the model of Ariel Beit Al-Halami in Eilat
It's hard to remain cynical to the tearful eyes and the warm and tight hugs Yannis Speropulos gave his players at the end of tonight's game in the Arena, and especially in the face of close cooperation and the secret exchange with John DiBartolmio, whose hands saved the Greek coach his job, and perhaps the whole season.
Because after losing my home derby and my eighth straight in Europe, to lose the Clasico to Jerusalem and walk away from it to three podium wins?
It would have ended the Israeli-Greek romance by tonight.
So, in the meantime, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, especially about urology.
First, the T.A. came in with a radical change in their offense and ball-moving habits.
The ball was moving on faith, with a lot of movement and practice, and Scotty Wilbkin, displaying, left the focusing to Evans, moving very little, mostly over blocks and heading for shots.
Despite the poor shooting (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed to the defense, and most importantly, the Cubs suddenly looked like a team, and the other players pitched.
And then, however, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in his brain, the team went back to their old ways, and the attacks went back to squealing and shelling, and in the most crucial offense, with a lead of 2 and 40 seconds to go, Scotty squeezed himself halfway into a corner and threw Floater on one leg that nearly lost the game.
The trick is to keep playing tricks and submission movements, right during the moments of clash, and that has to go into nature and the group DNA.
The important learning will be done by Yannis and the club on the use of Israelis.
The ones who became the water pumps and towel-wavers in the European Games.
Tonight they pitched for the coach who had stopped believing in them by more than half the team's points (42 out of 83), and were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of the top five shooters in my squad were her Israelis.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can help in the Euroleague.
For the first half it was mostly Oz Blazer, whose department has been screaming for a month he has to play more.
Bullets, morale, a fighter under the belt, seven rebounds, six feet of defensive determination and game play.
Isn't that enough?
In the second half starred Jake Cohen, with excellent all-around percentages, cooling off the line, and covering up for Jazzy's injury, especially John D, who at the 70-63 to Jerusalem changed the momentum with 5 straight points.
Lianus has a complicated relationship with Yeopet-Zuo, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and puts too much pressure on him, to the point of risking defeat.
It happens at Euroleague, and it happened tonight.
But the important lesson should be for the club, about its Americanization strategy.
Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to the Maccabi.
Tamar Ghinat and Sam Mahr left for Europe but not to the Maccabees, Rafi Manco has returned to Holon, and now Nahum Debrit is choosing Jerusalem, or perhaps rejected by the Maccabees.
And it happens because in the Macy's there are less and less places for Israelis, because of the club's educated and rooted choice to rely on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there won't be Israelis willing to play with it, and then she'll look for Jewish children to civilize them, and she'll press the union manager to increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake of the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that she's going overboard with strangers, much because of the tax break.
Of course we cannot say that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediocre ones, maybe five excellent ones.
For example, this season, with the money from Williams, Nunnally, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, two effective and consistent stars could be brought in beside Scottie and Zizicz.
It will be more effective, it will be more accurate, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and create identity.
It's true there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to rely on your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even gets tax breaks from the state for its alleged representation in Europe.
Basketball Association/league manager can help Maccabi, and come to terms with a number of strangers adapted to the Israeli league.
Six Brewsters, four on the form, maximum three on the field at a time.
Is it because of the continuing failures of the last seven years in Europe, just for me, that the league is flooded with foreigners?
And the players' union, what about you?
Is that what you took the sabbath for?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there's one?
It's like George Costanza in the pilot of Seinfeld.
Negotiate for less?
The old Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for the Mavs.
And if anyone needed reinforcement to that end, the duck official came in early and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and 4 Israelis who were only second in the youth teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Rowena and Sukhman Al-Hakim), she broke the record (second in the table!) for the second time in the last two weeks.
It's tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was a run like this back in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot of it back in the days of Sharon Drucker.
The short-line eagle is simply a more balanced and efficient group, and unlike Ariel Beit HaLammi, who started in the open at the Samuel Hill course, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone at their peak, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
Strangers are just making up.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather come back from their knee injury, it's gonna be a hell of a team.
A song I dreamed about a deer.
And Shakabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "It felt like the whole world was against us"
The Yellow happy after the 78:83 on the Jerusalem Arena: "We got back to playing like the TSA should play". •
The Biton people in the locker room, the first positive diagnosis of the ZZZZ injury and the management's approval of the purchase.
A great sense of relief was registered this morning among the men of the TSA after the important and prestigious 78: 83 yesterday at the Arena on the actual Jerusalem.
The players and the management embraced coach Yannis Sprouloupulos who seemed very excited at the end.
Ziva Fork and Oz Bleiser excitedly poured a water on top-scoring Derrick Williams, and the rest of the club had big happy smiles that showed how much pressure had been relieved after the recent losing streak.
They, too, feared a defeat in the face of a great adversary that would further destabilize the system.
Even the fans were left long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
"Janis and I have an amazing connection in the locker room", said Oz Blazer.
"We know it hasn't been easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We've been looking forward to it, the way we played.
We're back playing the way the TSA should play, with heart and fight, we stand behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us".
Before the game, team manager Amy Button came into the locker room and said some exciting things to the players.
"His stuff had a huge impact on how we went out and how we played on the floor", Maccabi players said.
Despite the excitement, the Maccabi are already geared for the crucial game against Baskonia on Thursday and want to break a long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us", Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games in the end and this time they led for a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"The last few games we've been under a lot of pressure, "Yannis told us that if we were free, we would win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
A lot of eyes on us and it was the feeling of the whole world against us, I'm proud to go into this war, we're disconnecting everything around and looking only at ourselves".
Andetta Czajcic, who injured his right knee during the last quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the dressing room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
The doctors will check to see how his knee reacts today and then figure out how many days of rest he'll need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Baskonia.
In addition to the support provided by the management of the Sporpolis and the professional team, at a meeting held on Thursday the professional director Nikola Vičić was given a green light to bring one or two players to strengthen the team, and the yellow hopes to soon add a quality acquisition.
Anthony Bennett released from Jerusalem prison
The forward who was the first pick in the NBA draft, was unable to fit into the team from the capital.
The club said, "Anthony entered into our hearts, "and thank him for his time in action".
About four months after signing the Jerusalem Act, Anthony Bennett was released from the team today.
The 28-year-old forward, selected first overall in the 2013 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaged 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games in the NBA Championship Game and 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in the NBA Finals.
"Officer Jerusalem and player Anthony Bennett announce they have reached a joint decision to terminate the player's contract with the club", the club said, "Anthony touches our hearts and we would like to thank him for his time in the lineup.
We wish him nothing but good luck".
Research shows that Zoom meetings hurt creativity.
Some 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem  some in videoconferences, some in face-to-face meetings
The result: Virtual meeting hurts creativity and thinking outside the box.
The lead researcher at Columbia University: "Visual focus on the screen hurts the process of creation of ideas"
There's no loss of productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature looked at the effect of video conferencing on participants' creativity, compared to face-to-face meetings.
Unfortunately, we find that creativity is indeed hurt in virtual meetings through screens.
The question for the study -- led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University -- was whether remote computer meetings preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming meetings, or do creativity and freethinking decline as a result of the distance.
The study itself started back in 2016 but got a big boost in the two years of the coronavirus, when many employees moved to work from home.
"People in a face-to-face meeting move around the room, using objects, and being helped to think creatively", says Brooks.
"In a computer session, on the other hand, the focus on keeping eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative brain activity.
Visual focus on the screen impairs cognition.
"People are more focused on video when interacting, which impairs the larger, expansive thought process".
Space is shrinking.
To test the results and see if they would repeat themselves, they were tested twice -- once at Columbia University and again in real life -- on engineers who knew each other from early on.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two halves -- one, they were asked to meet in person and develop solutions to a problem, and the other, they were asked to do it through a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide themselves similarly and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, there was a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher into ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study, but wasn't surprised by the results.
He thinks that in thinking activity, people usually look at their environment for a source to help generate ideas, whereas in video conferencing, thinking goes to the screen and doesn't expand in a creative way.
"When people in the same room look around and see the space, there are objects and situations that can trigger new associations in them.
On the contrary, research shows that interacting through the computer changes our attention so that we are more focused on the inside and the screen, and this way reduces innovation and generates ideas through looking at the environment and thinking outside".
There's no harm in critical thinking.
However, before managers rush workers back to the office, the researchers note that "computer work did not hurt productivity itself or people's critical thinking about innovative proposals, where they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
That is, the damage is focused only on creativity and not on other forms of computer work".
Professor Ellen Langer, a psychology professor at Harvard University, is also covering the findings.
She says, "There's a difference between just being creative, like new uses of Prisby, and working solutions.
It may also be that when employees are more relaxed after the introduction, or work from home, creativity does improve".
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also proposed a future study in which such meetings would be limited to thinking and wandering the room to see how this activity would affect the end result.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study only the brainstorming meetings would allow employees back to work, and as a general rule, he suggested not to be frightened by one study but to make another inquiry in this area.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forcibly returned and be unhappy. "That's a bigger insult", he says.
Musk awaits Trump's return: "It was not right to block him"
The new buyer of Twitter said it would reverse the decision, which led to the suspension of the former US President's account.
"I think it was a mistake", he admitted.
The Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter in a $44 billion deal, said Tuesday that he intends to return Trump to the social network that had blocked him as president following rioting by Trump supporters on Capitol Hill after losing the election to Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake", he said.
"If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and suspension - temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban", explained Musk.
By 2050, the world will lose 80 percent of the water available for agriculture
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years •
The Solution: Proper Management of Water
A disturbing new study recently published in the journal Earth's Future, predicts that by 2050, the amount of water available for agriculture will decline by about 80 percent if the world's water consumption and population growth rates stay on present trends.
In the study, which involved scientists from all the world's science agencies, scientists pooled the total amount of rainwater, rivers and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to humanity's agricultural needs.
The grim findings show that right now the rate of water use is doubling over and over in the last 10 years, while global warming is causing fewer rains in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study, 84 percent of the world's arable land will experience a severe shortage of rainwater.
One of the key conclusions of the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate and seasonal changes, and to switch to farming methods that take into account the water permeating the land to avoid water evaporation that leads to widespread rainwater waste.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater harvesting technologies to prevent it from flowing into the sea.
Information on many students from Bar University has leaked online.
The hackers who attacked Bar Ilan University's computer database a few weeks ago threatened to release the information about the students unless they received a ransom.
The threat has been fulfilled and the information is all over the Internet.
University of Burr-Ellen students are under attack from hackers as their personal information is leaked across the Web by a cybernetic attacker known as Darkrypt who posted a ransom demand a few weeks ago from the university and threatened that if he is not paid an unspecified amount of money, he will release the information under his control.
Estimates of the amount of money demanded by the attacker are that it began in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked upward, it reached millions of dollars before the information was released.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are filled with angry posts and a chaos is celebrated there, with students unable to access their personal information systems and unable to perform routine student tasks.
The university sent out a bulk e-mail message announcing the attack on the academic institution and that they are working intensively to minimize the damage, detailing some of the information that leaked online.
There were no specific instructions given to those whose data was hacked, and it stated that the university had undertaken a series of actions to strengthen the security of the university's servers.
In line to 40 communities: fiber optic to Benjamin
The trend of peripheral ownership of the high-speed internet continues and now fiber optic is coming to the Benjamin Council, which includes 40 communities. •
The project, a partnership between the council and telecommunications companies Telran, X-Fiber and Granite Internet, will launch immediately after the holidays.
Benjamin Council signed a comprehensive agreement this weekend to install fiber optics in all the council communities.
The agreement with the Net Fiber project on the Internet cooperation of Rimon, TeleRan and X-Fiber was signed after the end of a large tender that the Council made in recent months.
Work will start after the holidays and residents from the Council's 40 communities who are interested in connecting to the fiber optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 giga as well as an advanced edge to the house that allows for strong WIFI reception, as required in these times.
Subscribers will be able to choose between high-speed fiber-optic internet or a high-speed fiber-optic filter internet provided by Internet Grenon.
The Council made sure that the market remains open to competition in all circumstances.
The head of the Binyamin Regional Council, Israel Gantz: "This is real Zionism.
This is great news for the residents.
The experience of living in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to study remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and start advanced businesses in communities that will have quality Internet without delays.
I want to wish good luck to the dear companions in their mission in the communities.
The residents are waiting for you".
Gantz added: "We will soon have some of the best Internet speeds in Israel.
We worked for many months to lay the foundation for fiber installation, and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank the Minister of Communications Commissioner Handel, who started the project with us in his previous term and we are reaping the fruits of this work, the staff of the Minister of Communications, the members of the Council who were faithful to the details of the center, and the CEOs of the companies who won the center for professional quality from the best in Israel. "
CEO of Rimmon, Yarib Par: "I thank the Council President Israel Gantz and his team who immediately raised the glove in order to bring good news to the thousands of Council residents who will switch to fast Internet that will improve the quality of life in the fields of education, economy and, of course, recreation".
Talran Media Group CEO Shi Aslan: "We are pleased by the decision of Benjamin Council to connect with fast, powerful Internet infrastructure and I am confident that thanks to the extensive experience of the group we will be able to provide residents with high-speed internet just like in the center of the country".
The director of X-Fiber, Israel Elixor: "The establishment of communications infrastructure in Binyamin is the Zionist year of 2021, X-Fiber is proud to take part in the establishment of the latest infrastructure in the biblical areas of Binyamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with the Jewish areas in general and Binyamin in particular, we will meet every engineering challenge to bring the fast Internet to every house across the council".
We looked: what do the side effects after the coronavirus vaccine say?
Many people who inject feel weak, hot and tired after receiving the injection, while others don' t. •
Could this indicate a stronger immune system in those who do experience these effects, or is it just a baseless rumor?
As more and more people are being screened, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are incorrect.
Are the immune systems of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies reacted less severely to the vaccine, which might prove that their systems are not able to fight off an invading foreign body?
"There are several levels of response to vaccination", says Dr. David Dubeyre, chief of emergency medicine in the hospital and a member of the CDC advisory committee, and he reassures us: "Headaches, fatigue, aching joints - these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
"This is how the body responds to the entry of a foreign body into the system".
Is there a relationship between the levels of antibodies that develop and the side effects?
There is no correlation between sensation and the development of antibodies to the virus.
About 60 to 50 percent experience side effects, but about 90 percent develop immunity against the virus.
People who developed stronger responses were not found to be more protected".
"There is no correlation between immediate response and vaccine level in the medical literature.
In some of the trials where people also received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It's also a psychological component, how a person perceives the vaccine, if they expect there to be side effects.
A lot of the cold symptoms could have happened normally, but because the public is immune they attribute the reaction to the vaccine itself, and this is the bias we see with vaccines in general -- the attribution of cold symptoms to and in proximity to vaccination".
According to Dr. Devere, the causes of reported side effects, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
When it comes to myocarditis, opinions are divided.
"There are all sorts of theories, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One theory is that it's a strong immune response".
Is there any way to gauge the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, it was found that those who were sleep deprived or had high blood pressure were more vulnerable to infection.
Besides that, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there's a decline in the immune system, you can see it right away.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone's walking around with a weak immune system and doesn't know it.
These are people who are coming into the brewery because of recurrent episodes of infectious disease, and what affects the system are mundane things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want a too strong immune system because it can cause autoimmune diseases".
MRNA vaccines will soon appear in more contexts, thanks to the wealth of knowledge that has accumulated in recent times.
"will undoubtedly pave the way for other vaccines of this kind.
We're testing this technology for a whole lot of uses beyond vaccines -- treatments for cancer, for example.
Their efficiency is that the substance stays in the body for very little time -- goes in, does its job, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it's been given a major boost by the very high need for rapid vaccination.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week interval between doses is too small, and some immunization experts say that after a third dose we may not need another vaccine in the near term, so it's not clear if we're going to a six-monthly vaccine or the third dose will give a longer interval".
Thousands were affected: A serious privacy violation on Highway 6
Highway 6 customers?
Your personal information, including your full name, addresses, payment amounts, and full travel details, may be disclosed •
According to the Privacy Commission, Eretz Road has violated the Privacy Act and its regulations.
After a report that a company called Mers Arets, the Israel Highway 6 operator, had reported on a security incident at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority started an enforcement procedure.
During the event, a security flaw was discovered on its payment site which allowed the exposure of a large amount of information from the accounts of the company's clients which were exposed to the public.
Among other things, customers' payment accounts were exposed over a significant period of time, and those accounts included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates and times.
Moreover, since the transit company did not legally document access to its systems, it is not possible to know precisely for how long unauthorized agents have been able to access the company's systems.
In the letter of violation, forwarded to the company by the Privacy Protection Authority, the Authority stressed that most of the large companies and organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that with the development of threats and risks, the organization is obliged to carefully examine the updated risks and to act accordingly with the updating of the security measures accepted in the circumstances, depending on the nature of the database and its utility.
As a result, companies and organizations are required to update their systems and conduct risk assessments and penetration tests, to examine and assess the changing risks.
Companies and organisations are also required to use an automatic recording mechanism and training is required for employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy (Information Security) Regulations.
In accordance with the findings of the Supervision, the Authority determined that the company had violated the provisions of the Privacy Act and its regulations and required the company to take a number of corrective actions.
"The matter has been handled according to the strictest requirements".
Flight Alert for Istanbul: Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change the destination or time of their flight.
Good news for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: Airlines will allow them to change their flight times.
Earlier this week, counterterrorism raised the severity of the travel alert for Istanbul to four.
This is the highest level and means "high threat level: do not enter this country and if you stay, leave the country as soon as possible".
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have said that they will allow Israelis who booked their flight before the travel warning went out, i.e. before 13.6.22, to change the destination or the date of their flight.
It's a redirect to the airline.
Tourism Minister Rezabozov said: "Israeli citizens should not have to pay an economic price for terrorist threats.
I am glad that big airlines like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request and I hope that other airlines will give a similar response to all Israeli citizens who cancelled holidays in Turkey because of the severe travel warning".

Saudi skies are approaching: Israeli companies are preparing to reinforce lines to the east
Summary of expanded freedom of flight over Saudi Arabia: The airline is set to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of European destinations
Israel's largest airline is planning major changes ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we reported in Israel Today, the estimate is that Biden will announce the approval of Al Ali and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the UAE.
The impending agreement means you'll be able to fly on shorter routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.
To do that, the company would have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations in order to divert planes to new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations that have a sizeable Jewish population, but at this point are less profitable for society.
By contrast, the new destinations being explored in Bali are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
What's to be done: Dreamliners flying to Canada will be released for long-haul flights to the east.
Boeing 737s flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred to destinations such as London and Paris, to which Al operates on Dreamliner flights.
So the company can actually free up big planes to fly to other destinations in the East.
At the same time, the airline expects talks in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to fly back to Turkey, for which the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Who offers 6 euros for an extra 10 kilos, and where the price never includes luggage?

Exempt from quarantine for vaccinated and recovered from non-red countries, foreign tourists are returning.
The passengers have received notices from the Ministry of Health that they are exempt from the obligation to isolate with a negative coronavirus test.
Only then did the bureau release an official statement saying that the passengers were all from orange countries, although returnees from red countries also reported receiving the message.
In addition, tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
At the height of a pandemic, the end of quarantine for returnees from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent this morning (Monday) messages to return to Earth, saying that they are exempt from isolation with receiving a negative result to the coronavirus test performed after landing in Israel.
There are also returnees from red countries.
Some of the messages sent informed repeaters that they could be released after receiving a negative response or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the immunity after receiving the negative response.
Only then did official announcements come out from the Ministry of Health stating that as of midnight, 4.1.2022, vaccinated or convalescent returnees from orange countries will undergo a PCR test at the NatBEG and enter isolation for 24 hours or until a negative result (whichever is earlier).
The decision will be sealed in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and submitted to the Knesset Health Committee for approval.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovered people who have already returned to Israel from an Orange State and received a negative result from the PCR test performed upon entering Israel will finish their isolation at midnight and are not obliged to perform a second test.
However, passengers from red states reported that they also received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and who have returned from an orange-colored country will be placed in home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening the isolation with a negative result in a PCR test performed from the 7th day of landing in Israel (the landing day is the first day).
The decision to lift most of the restrictions on flights and especially vaccinated people comes a day before the High Court hearing brought by the association of ministries of travel, the Open Skies HQ and the hotel association.
At the hearing tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand the removal of all remaining countries from the red list, while being supported in their opinion by Professor Ithamar Grotto.
Foreigners will be allowed in.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transport agreed that as of 9 January 2022 vaccinated/recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will be allowed to enter from countries listed above - this will be subject to filling in an online form in advance, performing a PCR or antigen test before boarding an aircraft, performing a PCR test on entry into Israel and then quarantining for 24 hours or receiving a negative test result (which occurs first).
Foreigners who are not vaccinated/unvaccinated (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from the red countries, except those whose entry has been approved by the Committee on Exceptions, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The roster will not be updated at this time.
What about the red countries?
The committee on nation-by-nation classification at the Ministry of Health recommends the government remove from the red list of countries and move the following to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries remaining at this point on the red list are the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option being considered by the Ministry of Health is to exempt vaccinated persons returning from red states from quarantine.
It is not immediately clear if there is a link between the messages received this morning by the returnees to Israel and the instructions that may be received at the Ministry of Health on this matter.
The Ministry of Health has yet to respond.
The sky begins to open: Ministry of Health changes the restrictions on land gates
Vaccinated returnees from orange countries will be required to undergo 24-hour isolation
The United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates will be marked in red.
After long weeks when it was very difficult to find a destination to which one could fly without restrictions, and after all returnees from abroad were obliged to quarantine, along with the ban on tourists entering Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on the border guard.
The Ministry of Health has decided to recommend lifting the three-day quarantine requirement for Israelis returning from orange countries.
To date, anyone vaccinated or recovered -- as defined by the Department of Health -- who has returned from an orange country is required to self-isolate for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Now, vaccinated and recovered people returning from orange countries will have to go into quarantine for a maximum of 24 hours, or until they receive the results of the coronavirus tests they have had after landing at NABBG, whichever comes first.
Anyone not classified as being immunized or recovered will still be required to go to seven days of isolation subject to two coronavirus tests, or 14 days without the second test, whether returning from an orange country or returning from a red country.
Immunized or recovered returning from a red state must also be in complete isolation.
The latest red list of countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, and still pending government approval, includes the United States, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.
In all the countries except Turkey, the average positive in the last two weeks is more than 5% of their total income, automatically putting them on the red list.
The rate of increase in patients from Turkey is rapid, with a positive rate of just over 4 percent, and so it was decided to add Turkey to the red list.
The most prominent countries to be removed from the red list are France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, starting January 9, tourists who are vaccinated in accordance with the Ministry of Health's requirements will be able to enter Israel without the need for quarantine, with similar conditions for Israelis returning from an orange country.
Once again, the decision is subject to the approval of the government, which will be discussed in the coming days.
It's important to note that there are very few cases in which the government does not endorse the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
The tourists are against the restrictions.
The Travel Ministries Association, the Open Skies Foundation and the Hotel Association have petitioned the Supreme Court to lift the restrictions on flights.
The country lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but as noted, left eight significant countries on the red list.
At the hearing in Jerusalem this morning, the petitioners are expected to demand that the country be removed from the red list of states.
To support the petitioners is Professor Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Rzebowzow, who has in recent weeks supported facilitating the entry of foreign tourists to Israel, said yesterday: "The lifting of the quarantine for vaccinated returnees from abroad and the return of tourism to vaccinated ones is the right thing to do at this time.
I thank my friends in government, who understand the plight of the tourism industry and agree with me that the harm outweighs the benefit.
The vaccine is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, the vaccinated public is entitled to lead a supportive lifestyle alongside the corona".
With an investment of NIS 200 million, the new resort will open near Arad.
Desert blooms: Another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years
Chef restaurants, private pools, and 110 rooms are just a small part of what the hotel has to offer
All the details in the article
7MINDS from Beit Patel and the White City Building Real Estate Company have jointly purchased a plot spanning about 20 acres in the Judean Desert, where they will establish a luxury resort with an investment of about NIS 200 million. The hotel will be built on the same site as a former hotel that was demolished about a year ago.
The resort won't open for another three years and will have 110 rooms, some with private pools.
The hotel will also have three communal pools, a spa, chef's restaurants, a leisure complex, a gym and more.
Who will be in charge of the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ren Shmuely of Claro restaurant.
Chef Shmuel will be the one to develop the menu which is expected to have a desert concept unique to the resort.
The mayor of Arad, attorney Nissan Ben-Hammo, welcomed the project: "The decision to build a new and luxurious hotel near Arad gives the official stamp to the amazing princess Arad has made in the field of tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the choice of the entrepreneurs and convinced it will be a joint success, since we will perceive the enormous tourist potential".
Al on display: flights to all of Europe starting at $78
The skies are opening up, and airlines are getting into operations not seen in a long time.
Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Budapest, Berlin, Amsterdam and other destinations for less than $100 round trip
I know.
Israel's largest airline is reporting an increase in demand for international flights since yesterday's announcement of significant easing for passengers.
The company has decided to announce a special promotion this morning to celebrate the opening of the skies and the prices she offers are considered very attractive.
As part of the new operation, the airline offers flights to Berlin, Budapest, Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Athens, Amsterdam, Lisbon and other destinations for prices starting at $ 60 for round-trip flights.
Following the relief on flights, the airport is resuming flights to a number of destinations including Canada, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Belgium and more.
It is important to remember that this is a limited number of tickets (some 4,000) and the price does not include a seat.
The operation is valid for bookings made today and tomorrow and flights taking off until January 31, 2022.
Starting at midnight tonight, France, Spain, Portugal and more countries will be removed from the red list.
The United States, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and five other countries are still on the red list and there is a ban on flights without an approval of the Committee on Exceptional Circumstances.
Almost every person today has an old tablet or smartphone lying around in a useless closet.
Just because a slightly newer, more sophisticated model has come out, any device can be a Spotify player in a Hotspot connection.
Old devices can be traffic cameras, remote controls for home appliances and lots of other uses.
We don't have to be victims of consumer culture and we don't have to be always on the cutting edge of technology, with another really useless gadget.
Gathering data without analysis.
That's too bad.
It was more interesting to hear how many people got benefits at Israel Post, how much is the real estate of the branches (located in the most desirable city centers), and how much the employees' wages are (minimum).
Israel Post should not be privatized.
The question is, how many packages have arrived and how many have been distributed?
Because how many blinds them
They order packages, and they disappear into the Emergency Intelligence Center...
There should be a package tax of 5 shekels not just ordering crap on the scale and billing it to the post.
It mostly reflects the high cost of living in the country.
Thanks to the King of Pacs for making it easier to buy everything from China.
We're a household trying to stay away from the post office and hoping they won't have any letters, and the hatred for the post office has led us to give up everything that pertains to the possibility of a post office.
Have a good week.
Fire all the postal workers, and start reestablishing the post office by a private company.
Haughty employers and some racists!
They talk differently on the phone, and when they get to the interview, their real faces are revealed.
No wonder they can't find workers.
They're looking for slaves.
Jobs of slaves

Way to go.

Just lovely.
What a load of crap.
No Tunisian had to hide his Jewish identity.
Historically that's not true.

Waste of waste
Very well written, dear brother.
Kobe, I wish more people were like you.
I love you.
My dear brother
There are no people like you 😍

This is a man who sees what an amazing country we have.
There will always be problems.
That's life.
This is great, Kobi!
An admirable character!!
You will succeed in whatever you do!!!
Good job you're on the King's path.

I wish him all the luck in the world and that he continues to be as magical and gifted as he is.

Amazing family.
A few years ago, I had a dream about a lassitte Zackheim bearing a cow on her red head.
Beautiful and talented!!
How did you win the Sabbath guard?
A man who's all for his wife and kids.
Madly gifted.
Looking forward to her performances
Perfect.
You're the champion of the world!
Amazingly talented. A lot of success.
You are amazing!!! :-)
Congratulations to you.
Way to go!!!!!
Love has won!!!!
Congratulations to you!!!!
Not to worry is not for long.
It's of no use now.
How do you know it's true love...
Back together after 20 years!!

But don't worry, even as jerks and idiots running the Gram, we have abilities beyond what is expected!
Right, and besides, our psychics are as fucked up as most of them.
The rearguard is playing a game of "so to say", because in an instant- we'll never know...
Why only B.T.A.?
The rest of you take a right.
Despite the fine talk - we haven't heard of any arrests of hackers, you've prosecuted convicts with them -
And in the last four elections, the Election Commission did prepare for an attack?
Why not, for example...
Some intrusion attempts have been made and some have succeeded in breaking into the Elections Commission in the last three years.
Don't we deserve some data, facts and proportion?

A great guy. Coach has to give him more minutes. Don't give up on him.
- I did not.
Bring in Adrian Banks.
We need more strong Israelis on staff.
The ones that actually play.
Much more suitable than Willowkin to the bunker you built.
You can see there are professionals at the Blat and Cache.
Personal skills might still be comparable to a Scottish player, but a team player, and a game intelligence much higher.
So sad that the Tel Aviv MKV is relying on foreigners and the Israelis are warming the bench.
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes, not a collection of foreigners, so it's not going to succeed with all the stars scratched from all over the world.
Who cares about that?
If we're watching a game where six American players and three Israelis decorate, wouldn't it be better to watch the Golden State game????
The puzzle until the league finals.
Good luck to you.
Good column.
I did.
About the Israelis, he is absolutely right!!
And the comment about Ziou -- we saw last season that he's a good player who can also lead a team.
So in Euroleague he can't be a leader, but his decline in ability also in the league indicates that he lost the confidence (which is not surprising after the treatment he received after two bad games in Euroleague, as if foreigners didn't have such games) and its use may also be incorrect, and it is a result of the coach's persistence and patience.
Non-lethal laser with all due respect...
Jeev Zee should not be in the Tel Aviv police. He's killing her.
Used to have no good game but Sorkin and Blazer Uncle and Kohen today all credit.
They gave him 500 shekels, so he writes nonsense.
It's not Pederman.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jake Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor who in Europe play about 20 minutes and can't hit a basket. Who needs outsiders at zero and nothing levels, much better have the Israelis play.
Good spirit to everyone. Coach, players and management at the Momentum Works.
Depends on the increase in internal...
And discipline and required strengthening of center and guard.
And this is the management part.
It's not.
Direct human interaction is important in so many ways.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is bad both professionally and truthfully, and what's surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So just turn off the zoom, and the problem is solved.
So what, the researchers used zoom and so their creativity wasn't enough for this solution?
How do you know what will be 30 years from now?
Someone here missed an important detail.
Scientists don't care about warming or the rain.
All they care about is the rate of population growth.
They're working on more and more vaccines and more and more crap ways to destroy the world's population... so they tell us bogus stories about global warming and other crap they make up
There's no problem to drop water, in unlimited quantities
They said that 50 years ago.
Meanwhile, there are more people.
The solution is a birth control, especially in poor places and in the case of Babi's Baboons, the other anti-state leftists, and in all religions that believe in gods -- the stupid, the uninformed, the lazy, the blind, or in short -- the herd.
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living things (also sesmolin) consume oxygen and emit carbon dioxide.
The solution: Smolans, kill yourselves!
It's green.
Good for the world.
May you and the Earth and all of us be safe.
Who are the scientists and how did they do the research?
I don't believe any research that talks about global warming because that thing doesn't exist.
He's bent to control us to take away our freedoms and our freedom.
It's all part of the new world order.
And journalists like Assaf Golan are on their side as they did during Corona.
I've never heard him present facts from either side. He always brings the side that serves the globalists.
We're being haunted.
Just burning money on academic research.
As usual, another snippet from the psychopathic Smollan snippet world.
Human knowledge is expanding, and with it new and improved technologies.
For centuries, the world's population has been growing steadily at an exponential rate, and things are only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, have embarked on a huge war project in the Gobi Desert, with remarkable success.
The Saudis are doing the same thing and succeeding too (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It's the silly "climate crisis" of the sesmolinides that's making the Sahara greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the sesmolin agenda, so you won't read about it in the newspapers...
The left doesn't care.
Their pee goes straight to the head so they don't dry out.
Does proper management of water resources mean a reduction of at least 70% of the world's population?
It is amazing that COVID came and it's amazing that most of the population is being injected with experimental material whose 5- to 25 year-term effects on those who are injected are completely unknown.
It's surprising that Agenda 2030 is getting underway, and now this?
The whole thing is really confusing!!!
This is bullshit.
The stories of a thousand and one nights, all the fear and of course the bullshit of the left trying to control the world through media control, five years ago they announced that there will be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years.
They say there's been no rain in the country, and the drought is permanent. And here it is.
They also said that Rabin didn't kill Jews in Altana, and that Percy didn't know people were stealing octopus babies.
Moshe Dane, of course, did not loot antiquities, and Ezra Weizmann, didn't mess with his troops.
It's clear that you're promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
That is gross bullshit.
They'll also take care of the reception in the circuits, handle the blackouts and the voltage drops, and we're on the wave.
"This is real Zionism", like opening a Remy Levy stall in Jerusalem is Zionism.
Following the rogue Bennett, the rest of the lazy politicians will draw a line in the sand.
Even if you give me free flights, I'm not going near an El Al.
It was very nice to meet you.
You won't see us in your dreams.
Another great shame, we are in Israel held captive by the El Al company which holds all the direct flights by pigs prices better go already, it's time for the skies are truly open.4
Some are focused on this whole flying east thing.
Even if Saudi Arabia allowed the drone to fly over its territory, then it wouldn't add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not that big a game changer.
It is better to focus on accomplishments that are more interesting than such as energy supply, purchase of Israeli technology, transportation from Ashdod and Haifa ports through Jordan to Saudi Arabia Qatar and the UAE, tourism enabling Israeli companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
That's a lot more interesting than 30 planes a week saving an hour each.
It is more important to let Air Force pilots deploy in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran and get the emirates of Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Morocco to drop weapons on Iran nonstop for a month until the total destruction of its military infrastructure.
And another Air Force squadron to base in northern Saudi Arabia and strike Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from the east from a less crowded area.
After we're done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti and the Comoros to make peace with Israel and get most of the Arab League countries to join the peace.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market and the change in Erdogan, it was also possible to help Saudi Arabia overthrow the regime in Qatar and finally eliminate that country's subversion, and its support of the other Muslims and Hamas.
When all of these common interests are gone, we can talk about a few more flights from Ail if Ail even survives until then.
Al should be shut down.
Selling tickets for flights that don't exist.
The worst part is there's no way to get a representative
"There is no customer service".
Anyone who buys a ticket to L'Aquila and wants to change or cancel it, forget it, for sure.
You've been warned.
Air Canada is better.
They prefer to fly foreign anyway.
Earth has turned from a shithole of society to a hell of a society.
Al has dropped, too.
You better call a cab.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you sued the train to the field
40 euros for a suitcase is a lot cheaper than a visa.
You can carry a 20-pound backpack.
Why are you planting?
Wizz Air on cargo and sitting take a lot more significant!!!
One big one
Just an example. I just came back. If I live,
The weight limit is 30 kilos.
And the seven-pound troll.
And every extra pound is $30.
Go to your room.
All the companies steal the customer.
Advertisers advertise very cheap prices, but at the end of the day, this is a bag the size of a school bag.
A trolley is already costing money and a suitcase is very, very expensive.
It's a good thing the airlines don't ask us to come on the flight in our underwear and our bodies so there's no weight on the plane.
In El Al, the price isn't cheaper, but 50% off with bookings up to 6 hours before your flight.
The Israelis are not at all surprised.
The Israelis were and are combinees, in a successful way.
A land that eats its inhabitants and eats.
Add to that genetic cheapness.
It's also a shame for our country that allows foreign airlines to harass the Israelis...
There's no government, and everyone here does whatever they want.
So what did you learn today that's not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket..
They prepared a surprise for us all.
You'll pay extra for the wheels on the plane, the windows, for the luggage that doesn't arrive, for the food, the drink, and it'll most probably add to the services
In short, leave it at home and the prices will go down...
Go out in boats.
The journey will take a few days.
Throw up, and then you'll probably get there, too.
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and hurt Israel, and still have the right to locate and support his new fans.
Open it now?
It's not a coincidence.
When the trouble starts there's an exemption, just a hallucination of what's going on here...
This is not the peak of the epidemic.
Simon, it's not like you.
The number of confirmed cases is increasing. It doesn't mean that the number of patients is increasing.
Stop screening for all the crap. Stay home if you're not feeling well.
That's the end of the story.
A government of lunatics
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
A loss of control.
And mostly stupidity.
And confused the public score zero
Just more damage than repair.
"The daily death rate accumulated since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The faces and pictures behind the default".
Your ratings will go down.
You don't understand, the Treasury Secretary for not paying pizza to tourism workers
From them came more contagion.
They don't care about the people.
8,500 have died so far.
Anything about that?
They bury us, especially the elderly.
We became Russia/North Korea.
If we don't talk about it, it doesn't exist!
The main thing is that citizens put money into the state coffers to grow the cherry and the ass!
Apparently Doberman and Abbas are Prime Minister!!
Very well, the omicron suspension was relevant for the first week, now - no reason to isolate half the people, and there is no point in trying to stop the omicron - which is here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, they're statistically less dangerous than someone already here.
This is the first time I've seen sensible steps by the Israeli government in the fight against Corona.
It's like someone actually sat down and did the numbers, and, unlike Bibi, did what they thought would look better in the paper.
The dream government at its best:
The Minister of Finance telling the roadside teachers to find a new profession two weeks ago, just happens to open the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education is whistling to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and setting his own policy, which is throwing all the schools into complete chaos!
Foreign minister, a clown who gets sick in Corona for a cabinet meeting.
And the most clownish Prime Minister we've had in this country, uncontrolled and losing his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government without leadership, without direction. Every nation of Israel has lost faith in it.
Go home and be one hour early!!!
In my opinion, maybe it came from a bad place, but from a place of loss of control.
Now the prices there will go up to 50 million a unit.
So where are all the weather?
They're building a bus station and they believe it will affect every home.
Except for my sponsorship money, by the way.
The hotel will return to being a white elephant like before.
It looks amazing.
Good luck to you.
I feel like it.
How about the art of being photographed completely nude?
Giving up the junk
A serious fight for an elective field.
Why don't they give benefits to girls in the occupied Galilee by the Muslim Brotherhood of the Chabad?
All to the Kalans
In the current reality, the South is still ours?!
Do you need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
The members of the Knesset will be there too!
How about a people's hotel for a people's man?
Good for investing in the South.
Arad grows and prosper and all respect to the mayor who, since his inauguration, has been blasting for the good and glory of the city of Arad.
Cultural life, society, education and more on the rise.
Just a great mayor who made the city better!
Way to go.
I wonder how much Bedouin sponsorship the resort owner will pay.
Have you got the sponsorship money ready?
Wow, that sounds good.
Who can only afford a super company with the best service and security in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai?
Not on a can company.
Neither socially nor economically.
In the last few weeks, she canceled flights coming in from abroad, you know, sending messages to Israelis telling them that the flight had been canceled, instantly canceling the entire trip, telling the passengers to leave a message on W.App or on Messenger and come back, come back in two or even three days.
The trip is ruined.
Besides better to land planes on the ground, than to make the flights back to Earth, and also prevent economic damage?
Any more suckers flying over?
Don't even fly with them for free.
Have they returned the millions of customers they captured?
EasyJet to Geneva one way and back is 70 euros.
Al, one way is $560.
The goddamn phoney who runs the company with his bastard son. I don't buy it for 10 bucks, phoney all the time...
And then the airline will cancel the flights and offer coupons that are worthless.
Because their implementation will be in addition to the price change.
Those who buy tickets by fraud put their money on the wing.
A can company.
Low coast drills.
No luggage, no seat selection, certainly no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all members of the Guerrilla... Up!
Nature has a way of diluting fools!
