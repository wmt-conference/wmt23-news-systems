And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..
¬ó A letter from the occupation.
Kherson is the one to watch.
Natasha, we're holding on hard.
It feels like they're afraid.
They are very afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat several times that they are big, that they are strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and in the head is spinning - how do you, c@ki, fear if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat this greatness.
How you are unsure of yourself.
It's like, sexual intercourse with an impotent, who must endlessly repeat that he is strong, that everything works out for him, for a very long time and stubbornly for him to try and at the same time think, when this painful abuse finally ends.
We are repeating this in order to keep us all.
Because it is very difficult to fight an unarmed man against a brainless torso with a machine gun.
Because then, when this filth is banished from our land, we will have to organize the city.
Whoever we're talking to right now, they all have one word.
Words that the city smells rotten.
We will probably need a lot of detergent to just long wash the sidewalks, houses, and even trees.Because everything that these inhumans touched, has the smell of rot.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were big.
Three healthy men stripped her and left her on the street, forbidding anyone to approach her to help.
For three hours she stood in the street undressed and only said loudly:
Don't come near me, my friends.
Don't put yourself in danger.
Please, please, please!
We'll still have a lot to do with you...
Then there's that!
And so on.
They are stealing.
They are stealing everything.
It's hard for me to imagine that they don't steal.
We've never seen theft on this scale.
Starting with children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because they are constantly posting leaflets in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the APU.
And when they are close, the Chersonese with bare hands and teeth will deal with impurity.
They can feel it.
So they're in a hurry.
And we'll wait and see.
Let's wait and see.
We clench our teeth, clench our fists to numbness in our fingers and wait.
Because we have something to wait for.
To be once and for all.
And none of these are unclean.
And then we'll wash the city.
For a long time.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..
The author of the written for obvious reasons is not specified.
and I need communication. I've sent something out. I know that with sour people few people want to communicate, but still do not lose hope
How satisfied are you with housing?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same profession as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar issues are now being reflected by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs as part of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The findings will help to better understand their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
All those who provided a functional e-mail when requesting humanitarian assistance, leave an invitation for research (from the address of the invitation@click4survey.cz).
The questionnaire is only filled in once!
By filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!

On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the terms of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all Ukrainian refugees arriving without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required) are entitled to first aid of 5,000 kroner.
In order to receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation - be considered unemployed, not have property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The first benefit payment will cease to be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily meals and hygiene supplies, he will not be able to claim the payment of 5,000 kroner.
The authorities will begin to believe that basic assistance was provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and the payment of money is not necessary.
This measure is designed to solve the problem with Roma refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for monetary assistance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Only those refugees who prove an immediate need (lack of work, etc.) will still be entitled to the cash payment of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth aid.
However, two more conditions will be added:
‚Üí as in the first paragraph, only those Ukrainians who have not been provided with free housing, daily meals and hygiene supplies will be able to receive financial assistance;
The applicant must actually live in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of tourism for the sake of help, when a refugee lives in the same country, and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days solely for money.
According to the law, each foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the change of residence within three working days after the move.
If the address in the application form does not coincide with the address specified in the MIA database, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she actually resides in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the benefit will be denied.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion on humanitarian aid. kronor.
And today I was engaged all day digging defenses, and the whole city is digging, something not very joyful predictions for the coming period.
Frankly tired, it is very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army to dig trenches and trenches, for this we need someone to organize equipment and people, and I'm the head of the village then it's my duties
All utilities are involved, and we also appeal to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We must unite, because otherwise we can't overcome the katsups
Very great propaganda for people to despair and weaken the resistance
Honestly, I did not take a shovel in my hands today, I hope I will not have to
My kids put girl stickers on my phone case so I don't forget I'm feminine
What happens if the bill is passed?
A government commission will be formed from representatives of the Office of the President, some ministries and business associations, which will speedily review the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
The Commission and other executive bodies will review all permits for doing business in most areas by the end of the year.
And they will suggest which of the permits or procedures should be removed.
The Cabinet will remove all unnecessary permits and procedures in an accelerated mode.
Without any public discussion, in backstage mode!
It won't matter if the Cabinet's decisions contradict the current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of economic activity, which can harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
Business regulation by the state will be based on the principle of one new permit - minus two old permits.
Whether or not it makes any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
In the backroom mode, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents on permits or procedures in the field of environment.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc. will be under threat!
Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We won't even know how and who is changing the bylaws until the moment of making the final decisions.
üòÜÔ∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the opportunity to influence are the business associations.
Bill 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
The tight deadlines for reviewing permits, the opaque procedure, the absence of any criteria for decision-making - this is a move somewhere to the east, not to the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the
They told her ¬ñ babo, the Russians came to the village; grab your cat and climb into the bus.
But she refused ¬ñ that I, the old mare... Save the children and the girls, I'll be here... Baba goes down to the cellar, owls cucumbers, rolls a tub of junk, a bunch of troughs; There's a door ¬ñ iron shoves and silver locks.
And outside the door someone rattles the chains.

Seventy-odd years ¬ñ and washing again.
Go ¬ñ but not through the cities, for I curse you, You will bring us near putin kaput.
The cat babin hisses, the windows crack glass.
Tanks are rumbling and tumbling between houses.
The Russians are coming into the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Hello, go to the post office and confirm your identity through "check-in" then at confirmation you will be given a code, and this code again you have to specify in the registration on the Internet and you are ready.

Good afternoon, dear Mrs. Angelino!
I want to express my point of view regarding the use of "in" / "on" in relation to the word "Ukraine."
The use of the term has turned into a serious political issue in recent decades.
Russia's war against Ukraine today was prepared long and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy
Thank you for interesting exercises and tasks, for a clear explanation of grammar, pleasant communication.
We are especially grateful for the technical support of the training, first of all, for the textbook, which made it possible to understand what was sometimes not learned at lectures.
These three months have laid the foundation for our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish the whole creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions he popularizes world classics in the Ukrainian language, among them Lolita (V. Nabokov), Perfumer (P. Zyuskind), Grykh M. Kotsiubynsky, List of the Unknown and "Wild" S. Zweig, etc. (etc. ).
The works that he stages are difficult to perceive, require the insertion of soul and heart.
The author deliberately leads the audience to deep feelings and tears.
In his opinion, tears are purification, this is the way to the recovery of modern man.
Has a whole host of accolades.
In 2005, he received the title of "People's Artist of Ukraine," laureate of the National Prize of Ukraine. Taras Shevchenko (2007), but most of all Mr. Mykhailo appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate him.
The connoisseurs of Mr. Mikhail's talent hope that at the end of the war they will again hear his playing on the saxophone, see his unsurpassed ability to reincarnate, be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to the high art
Mineral resources of Ukraine
By origin, minerals are divided into magmatic, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Therefore, their placement is closely related to the structure of the Earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
Fuel minerals that are mined in our country include: coal and brown coal, oil, natural gas, peat, combustible slate.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully provides its own needs for coal and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing acute shortages of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we have a rational economy, acute shortages can occur in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissia.
Since the mid-1990s. It was used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, agriculture, glass, porcelain, and food industries.
Various chemicals are also obtained from peat, including acetone, phenols, paraffin, fodder, yeast.
Large deposits of combustible shale are in Cherkasy and Kirovograd regions.
The geography of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources have a sedimentary origin, so they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as in the edge foothills.
Coal is coming through.
94.3% of our state's coal deposits are coal.
Ukrainian coal is of high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine there are deposits of the best grade of coal ¬ó anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of the coal is coking.
After special processing, it is used during the smelting of iron and steel.
According to the explored reserves of coal, Ukraine ranks 8th in the world and 1st in Europe, and in terms of production ¬ó respectively, 11th and 3rd place.
The explored coal reserves in Ukraine amount to about 50 billion tons.
Forecast reserves ¬ó about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write messages on shells that are dropped on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
So, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the stage of Eurovision to save the military, blocked on Azovstal in Mariupol ¬ñ and the next day the Russians wrote on the shells Kalush, as you asked! #on Azovstal.
The missiles used by the Russian military on April 8, 2022, shelled the station in Kramatorsk, it was written For children.
Then from shells with cynical inscription killed 61 people, among them ¬ñ 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared in the First World War.
In World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies.
It then helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on the shells by the Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture by the aggressor army.
With these shells, they are killing civilians and destroying peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they do not like the political course of Ukraine.
Russia needs to stop such messages did not come to any other country!
The crossing of Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© met us in a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
We carry insulin, it needs a temperature regime ¬ñ can not be heated.
Is it possible to pass control in accelerated mode?
The border guard allowed us to stand at the beginning of the queue, even the trucks gave way amiably.
Lviv
The city of Lion is alive.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body - an endless stream of people.
People from all regions of the country have found shelter here and a sense of security.
Some go further to Europe, some go home, some stay.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the dictation-choked windows of the cathedrals.
It envelops monuments and sculptures with white canvases.
But the war can't be heard in Rynok Square, where thousands of voices are heard at the same time, it can't be heard in coffee shops and bars, where people continue to live.
Yes, life subsides before ¬ñ at 11 p.m., life hides from the curfew.
But it is: when we sat in the cafe at 9 p.m. and declared an alarm, it was heard only from a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpin
The way to Kyiv we laid through two of the many martyr cities ¬ñ through Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities where the air smells of hope.
People, despite the pain, return and rebuild their lives.
A private home.
Fence ¬ñ as a sieve.
(Debris of shells or automatic queues?..)
On a shattered balcony ¬ñ the Ukrainian flag is stretched.
At the front door ¬ñ holes, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And at this front door, three are popping.
Clean, repair, build a wall and with it a new life.
And two blocks down the park, my mother walks with her child.
Can't help but wonder: Did their dad survive the shootings of men in Bucha?
Do you walk with them?
On the way out of Irpen - cemetery of cars.
These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and were ruthlessly shot by the Russian invaders.
This cemetery has already become the object of a kind of patriotic tourism.
If you go deep and stand surrounded by car skeletons, you can feel a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slowed air, it feels like it can be cut with a knife.
It's been weeks since the passengers died....
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.
And in one of the cars ¬ñ abandoned bike, in the other ¬ñ warm children's overalls.
Somewhere burned a book with instructions for using an airbag.
The remnants of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
We drive on, I look back at the city for the last time ¬ñ and I come across the same bridge under which the frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, but it is on these broken plates that the Ukrainian military carried a baby in white.
This child in a white jumpsuit must have survived.
But is there a chance that a child who wore clothes left in one of the cars lives?
A man sits on a broken bridge, a camera over his shoulder.
Just sitting and looking at the gap between Kiev and Bucha.
He doesn't take pictures, he just looks.
Perhaps also imagines that under the bridge he stands, and thinks: how is it?
Happy holiday! ¬ñ exclaims to us joyfully a man. ¬ñ Happy City Day!
On May 29, military Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, strong and independent.
Mykolaiv
Hero city, outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A front-line city that can't be captured by the occupiers.
And we believe that they will not seize ¬ñ the city is fighting and living.
At the corner of the streets, at every other intersection ¬ñ neatly stacked piles of tires and Bandera strips.
Evening Nikolaev is now incredibly quiet ¬ñ noise, against the background of which lived the city, quiet.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And it's extremely dark at night.
Light masking for safety.
People live by candles, more precisely, with mobile phone flashlights.
At home, we only turn on the lights in the kitchen ¬ñ quickly and as needed.
Grandma draped heavy blankets over the windows, through which light does not penetrate.
There is a hunting rifle by my sister's children's bed.
Underhand from the 24th , ¬ñ says the father.
With air alarms and the sounds of explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time anymore.
Even in a front-line city, living in a mode of constant anxiety is very difficult.
When then to live?
The Russian army ¬ñ 30 kilometers from the city, shots from pionov fly to the October area, cover Kulbakine.
I fly close to my family a few times.
To the next block, across the street from us.
To grandmother's neighbors ¬ñ the grandmother threw out the windows, the children took them to themselves, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of Ingul and Central regions.
Life goes on.
A siren howls on the central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple sit on a bench, talking about something, calmly discussing it.
A cyclist drives past them.
Looking back with Dad ¬ñ what are we going to do?
Well... Let's go get some coffee?
So we sit on the street Soborna (former Soviet, by the way) in the square near the monument to St. Nicholas.
And what else to do?
To be honest, when a siren catches you by surprise on the street, there's often nowhere to hide, no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
It's not just a hole in the building, it's a hole in the heart of every Nikolayev.
On the lawn at the entrance lies a huge trident ¬ñ once from the decoration of the RSA.
At the same time, the place where the trident appeared, there was an empty nothing.
As well as in the place of the office of the head of the regional state administration and a dozen offices around.
The rocket landed clearly on Kim's desk.
The war takes a completely different shape when it is not in the news, but underfoot.
I walk along the corridors of the RSA, and with each step I hear the crunch of glass.
There are numerous documents scattered on the floor ¬ñ someone has filed requests and applications, but now it doesn't matter.
On the table of one of the surviving cabinets ¬ñ a dusty cosmetic bag.
On the bedside table ¬ñ a flower.
They took her home, transplanted her, even though she lived.
The shooting of a guard who was in post on March 29.
He survived.
Stamped, stitched, ¬ñ points to the head. ¬ñ Already at work ¬ñ.
Only journalists can enter the UDA.
With us ¬ñ a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, direct inclusions, interviews.
According to official figures ¬ñ 36 dead.
This is September 11 in Mykolaiv, the monument to the Russian measure, comments the press attach√© of the regional head.
Mykolaiv Regional State Administration - this is just one of the wounds on Mykolaiv's body.
And these wounds will not soon heal.
Even when Denmark helps to restore the RSA, the Mykolayiv people will always see it as a terrible void.
Russia has launched a new gas war.
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of the hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced by more than a third the transit of gas to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transportation system.
In April, it completely stopped supplying gas to Bulgaria and Poland, in May ¬ñ to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced the supply of gas to European countries through the gas pipeline Nord stream.
Official Berlin expects that Russia will cut off the supply of natural gas this way in July.
Russia used this blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation shut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
Gas has always been not just a commodity for Russia, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the first priority is the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West.
Funding the Russian economy - is to donate to the Third World War.
The coming winter will be difficult, but will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and trying to quickly diversify gas and oil supplies.
But it will take time for the EU to become energy independent of Russian energy.
Meanwhile, the Putin regime is intimidating Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and a lack of heating in homes.
Countries in Europe, especially dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may experience its shortages.
But this crisis will stimulate a more frugal attitude towards natural resources and increase energy efficiency.
Europe will benefit if it abandons Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as geopolitical weapons.
Temporary discomfort must be endured so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia produces crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary projectiles that destroy crops and oilseeds.
Russia is causing famine in the world.
Because of the Russian war, the number of people in the world suffering from food shortages could grow by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, Russians steal already harvested grain from Ukrainian grain elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, block maritime exports.
Destruction of the agrarian potential of Ukraine - another manifestation of Russian military aggression.
So Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital is launching an innovative format of the hotline ¬ó the virtual center of Diya.Business.
IDPs from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registration of their own stay, business registration, employment and receiving assistance.
Therefore, the virtual center Diya.Business is launched in order to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format until Ukrainians can return home.

Good afternoon, Hanna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician and ask when you can come next to get vaccinated for Darusya.
It was supposed to be tomorrow, I can't come because you need to replace the battery in the car, it will be by the end of the week.

But on the panel of the car writes, you need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia has to bring it from Ukraine, and here I will replace it

Okay, we'll go with you at 11:45 so you don't take any chances.
"The war is not over and the fates of our new neighbours are also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escaping to safety, of mothers telling their children about the great adventure journey they take together to put them in hastily loaded cars.
Stories of children feeling insecure and afraid of all adults who still don't quite understand why their parents stayed home.
The stories of children for whom the only memory of the house is a toy they could cling to during the many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people - are highlighted by the organizers.
At the end of each trip, ¬ñ a return to a safe house.
But this trip is different, scarier.
That trip didn't even end after more than eight months.
A return home is foreseen.
The theme of war is ubiquitous, so our march may seem superfluous.
On the contrary, in the face of mounting antipathy and hostile sentiments in the society being inflamed and exploited by the peoples, we wish to point out that involuntary travellers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in a poetic form and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
They are part of it now..
Despite such a painful theme, the parade still managed to make it bright and encouraging.
This was done by craftsmen and craftsmen who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, moths, houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade went from Kampa to Vaclawak, and at each stop played a huge performance, the drama of which was developed by the Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to keep the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians are facing now," says the playwright. - Therefore, the performance structure reflects normal life, which is interrupted by an air attack.
To the rescue first comes the glowing birds - they close their wings in the first place, children.
And after a recent large-scale missile attack, this shielding wing symbol is becoming even more relevant.
Children's voices begin to sing the Ukrainian song.
This song is floating in a column.
And all the creatures came back to life: sunflowers, moths, toys and even houses.
That's the kind of symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who helped and helped Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we will be able to overcome this difficult path and security will prevail in the houses..

Our editorial team talked to Ukrainian refugee Maryna, who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.
Now I am trying to realize myself as an artist, - said the Ukrainian.
Anxiety, insecurity, fear, feelings for relatives.
In conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, there is confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she found herself with her children.
But the woman believes in her strength and tries to adapt to life in Prague without leaving the thought of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Maryna comes from Nikopol, which is in Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children - a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect at the State Nikopol Institution.
By education I am an architect of buildings and structures, graduated from Dnepropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Prior to that, she studied at the art school, graduated from the lyceum with a degree in artist-designer, ¬ñ Marina said.
And all was well, but on February 24 her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Maryna, without thinking, left Ukraine with her children.
The shelter for women was Prague.
Of course, a new city, a big, crowded... A new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so much of what the Czechs tell me, I understand.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy for me.
In addition, I am not ashamed to seek help from the Czechs and have never felt any aggression from them.
Thank you for that, Mary shared.
According to her, she was helped in solving issues related to finding a home, applying for a visa and insurance, applying for benefits, people who have already lived in Prague for a long time.
But many problems she has to solve on her own.
Lack of space in the garden
Having received a visa for a tolerated stay, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
Of course, I want to find a job by profession.
But when employers find out I have two children, they throw up their hands... , ¬ñ she said.
They didn't take us to the garden because there are no places.
They say that we need to look for adaptation groups for children, and where they are, no one knows specifically.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She wanted to help me find a place in the kindergarten for children, calling a number of different stations, but... , ¬ñ continues Marina.
In general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, they find it difficult to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient.
I can't say that the children interfere with me, but if they went to the kindergarten, I would be able to quietly attend Czech language courses.
One day she went with the little ones to classes in Czech, so they played a little, and then began to behave uneasily.
I, as a normal mother, was distracted, could not study normally... If there were language courses for adults with children or with small ones someone was during the study...But my daughter is so attached to me, ¬ñ a woman sighs.
Of course, we and the children go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which a great special thanks to the Czech Republic, ¬ñ added Marina.
When the children sleep, Marina is engaged in self-education, teaches Czech online, because she understands that it will help her find a job and somehow self-organize in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
Once Marina looked at vacancies on the Internet and saw an announcement: As part of the initiative of the Association Spolek Zaedno with the support of the EC representative office in the Czech Republic 12 stars for Ukraine we organize a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.
Only creative imagination is required of the participants...
Marina couldn't help but take advantage of this opportunity.
I took courage and applied to participate.
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we painted all day.
I didn't sleep before, I was worried.
Besides, I did not take a brush to my hands for six years, ¬ñ said the Ukrainian.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings were created on a canvas of 80 x 60 cm, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists.
The theme of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use the Ukrainian theme in our works ¬ñ based on the palette we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
Therefore, the collection of paintings is dominated by blue-yellow colors, ¬ñ Marina added.
The event was attended by 30 applicants, of which only 12 were elected.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic will be held in Prague with their participation.
This is how life happens.
All your once-acquired knowledge and skills can be useful, and also support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic, ¬ñ Marina noted.
I'm trying to make it as an artist.
Every step ¬ñ is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
But you have to do something... , ¬ñ said the woman.
Maryna thanks the Czech Republic for its hospitality and friendliness, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will take a long time to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia has started.
However, Ukrainians do not expect better times, but have already started to clean their cities and villages from Russian garbage, rebuilding infrastructure.
Kiev took the blow in the first days of a full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital in a few days and capture it.
These towns and villages survived active hostilities, atrocities of the Russian army, in some places ¬ó occupation.
In early April, the APU completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksandr Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after the active hostilities and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public space.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly capture Ukraine, Russia began a new phase of this war - information.
Russia is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and to reduce the support of Ukraine from the international community.
International organizations assess the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces to fight the aggressor, and thus become accomplices to the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization in its report noted that the Ukrainian military is equipping positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure facilities.
At the same time ignored the fact that it is only about objects from where the civilian population is completely evacuated.
Do not give in to the information attacks of Russia!
Remember: Russia has attacked Ukraine, seizes its territory, kills and tortures civilians, destroys cities and villages.
Russia is guilty of war, it has no right to any action on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and beat the enemy out of the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine to stand against Russia on all fronts!
I'm sure every person in the world has ever dreamed of their perfect home.
Believe me or not, I'm no exception.
Now let me tell you about my perfect home.
My perfect home would be on an island in the tropics.
It would be next to the beach and have a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I will definitely be happy to live in the heart of the picturesque landscapes.
My house would be a two-storey cottage with a lovely exotic garden in front of the house and there would be lots of different flowers and fruit trees..
I'll also have a garage for my car.
By car, I'll be able to drive to work, shop or just travel with my family wherever our eyes take us.
In my ideal house there will be at least six rooms: a bright and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, a study with a workplace and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with bedside tables and chests of drawers.
In the office there will be many interesting books in bookcases.
The living room will be the most visited place in the house, there the whole family could gather together, share the news or just have fun.
That's why there would be a large sofa with small cushions, several armchairs, a chest of drawers, a huge TV and a long built-in aquarium.
Also, my ideal house would have a loft where we could do a home theater or an entertainment room.
Behind my house would be a pool with a few hammocks.
We would also have a sports centre where we could do exercises every day to keep fit or just do different team sports like volleyball, basketball, football etc.
My perfect home would be big and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I would love to live in it.
But that's just my dream ... I have to make it a reality.
Hi, how many men should there be,so I know which room to cook?Is she alone?
Letters I gave the secretary to you
Yes, of course, I ask how many of them to know where to settle them

So they have to know I hope they find the main thing not to panic because now I do not know what to do ready to go and do the search myself but I will not be allowed to Donetsk there now heavy fighting and I do not know how it will be with the search for it is hard

FC "Minay" says that this is a fresh photo from the last trainings after the fight with the Russians
In Antalya, Turkey, a conflict between the players of the Ukrainian football club "Minay" from the Premier League and the Russian "Shinnik" took place at the meeting.
The sides confirmed that there was a fight on the territory of the local hotel, where both teams accidentally settled.
Initially, Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict that took place on February 13.
The fight was then confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC "Minay," the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
As if one of them was drunk and clinging to a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight did take place, but already on the floor, where the Russians stopped, and in equal numbers.
The number of victims on the side of "Shinnik" only confirms the fact that the Russians still "throw" their own, - the statement reads.
The club says that after the end of the clash, the Russians continued fighting with each other, had to intervene with the local police.
"Before the beginning of the meeting, the main demand of FC Mynay to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to settle "Shinnik," - the statement reads.
Football journalist Roman Bebeh, who was one of the first to report the situation in a tweet, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player defending an employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that the Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Telegram channel Baza writes that the representatives of "Minaya" approached the players of the Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian national anthem.
The Ukrainians have denied it.
"The numerical advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our guy.
Yaroslavets stood up for him and defended him.
We had five or six people, many more Ukrainians," a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"Yaroslav football players examined by a doctor, among the damage - dissection of the lip, a fractured toe and suspected bruised ribs," - writes "Kommersant."
"I do not understand where the Ukrainians could come from in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine," - said Sergei Kulakov, General Director of "Shinnik" in a comment to journalists.
Later, Kulakov told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but stressed that they were not being evicted, they decided to leave themselves.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian are losing weight.
And what is the medicine for diabetics
7 minutes (s) ago
The injections, gaining popularity, help to lose up to 15% of weight, but have a lot of side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy weight loss injections, which are used by some famous people, including Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in type 2 diabetes.
In its application confessed Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience on social networks.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other treatments for type 2 diabetes can indeed contribute to weight loss.
By affecting specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, a person is less likely to feel hungry, more likely to be full and consume fewer calories.
However, experts warn that it's not a quick fix or a miracle cure that helps you lose weight without any effort.
Treatment takes place under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and physical activity.
Like any medication, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or upset stomach, bloating and gas.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to loss of fat on the face, and in some people - to the loss of cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
This effect doctors called the "face of Ozempic" from the name of another drug for the treatment of diabetes, which is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors advise to take Wegovy no more than two years.

On some parts of the front of the Armed Forces managed to restore the previously lost positions and consolidate there.
This was stated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhnyi during a conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhnyi, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk direction, where the Russians carry out up to 50 attacks every day.
Fierce fighting continues in the area of Vuhledar and Marinka, where according to Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces reliably hold the defense.
"Despite the constant pressure of the enemy, we continue to keep Bakhmut under control and take measures to stabilize the front line around this city," Zaluzhny said.
Speaking to General Milley Zaluzhny shared his concern over Russia's use of sea surface drones, which poses a threat to civil navigation in the Black Sea.
Russian troops continue to tighten the ring around Bakhmut after seizing Soledar.
Now this city is the main goal of the Russian army.
Sergei Shoigu, the head of Russia's Defense Ministry, said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut for his troops was "developing successfully."
On February 11, in the evening of the General Staff, it was said that Russia was strengthening its grouping of troops in the Liman and Bakhmut directions.
In the evening of February 10 and in the night against 11 Russians attacked critical infrastructure of Ukraine in several regions.
As reported in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from six o'clock in the evening of Friday and until midnight, Ukrainian air defenses destroyed two dozen "shahedes" that the Russians launched from the east coast of the Azov Sea.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile attack on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

EU to tighten sanctions against Russia on anniversary of invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
On the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, the European Union will introduce new sanctions against Russia.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (Olaf Scholz), speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag ahead of the extraordinary EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU would support Ukraine "for as long as necessary."
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provides Kiev with the greatest financial support.
"In the supply of weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone in continental Europe," he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized "public bidding under the motto: battle tanks, submarines, planes - who will demand even more."
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda will benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Scholz: NATO should not become one of the parties to the conflict
In addition, the German Chancellor once again stressed that, despite all the assistance provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not become one of the parties to the military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue to coordinate closely with partners in the supply of weapons to Kiev.
Scholz recalled a pledge he made to Ukraine at an EU summit in June 2022 to support the path to European integration.
At the upcoming extraordinary summit, the EU countries intend to reaffirm their commitment to the European path of Ukraine, he stressed.
Ukraine belongs to Europe, and its future belongs to the European Union, the Chancellor added.
The extraordinary summit of the European Union will be held on February 9-10 in Brussels.
One of the main topics will be Russia's war against Ukraine.
According to Reuters, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend the summit of EU leaders.

Metsola calls for fighter jets and long-range weapons to be given to Kyiv - DW - 09.02.2023
The President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metzola, during a meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke, called for Ukraine to provide aircraft and long-range weapons.
"EU member states must quickly consider, as a next step, providing the long-range systems and fighter jets you need to protect the freedom that many take for granted," Metsola said.
The answer, she said, must be proportionate to the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union," she said, addressing Zelensky.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
Zelensky, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on the way to EU membership.
"We are approaching the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
The winning Ukraine is a winning member of the European Union," Zelensky said in his speech to European parliamentarians.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself against "the most anti-European force of the modern world."
"The Ukrainian European way of life is being destroyed by total war.
But for what?
To destroy the European path as such after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of the 27 elements of the European way of life, 27 EU countries.
We will not allow it," the President of Ukraine stressed.
Zelensky will ask to speed up the supply of weapons
The day before, DW reported that Zelensky had arrived in Brussels to receive the support of the European Council and to speed up the provision of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As the source of the newspaper from Zelensky's advanced diplomatic team recalled, during Zelensky's visit to the United States at the end of December last year, Kyiv received "an agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support, which was voted for by Congress."
"Therefore, the President of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally goes to other capitals," - said the interlocutor.
At the same time, the diplomat noted that, "of course, such decisions are not a matter for the European Council, but the decisions of the member states."
Zelensky is expected to voice Ukraine's need for weapons during the Euro-Council summit and to speak personally with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member states.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine needs first of all long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia launched a major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kremlin line in the west of the region has increased markedly over the past week, analysts said in a February 8 report.
It also noted that the geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed the Russian offensive successes in the area of the Two-Year North-West of Svatovoe.
APU does not allow Russia to achieve significant success
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three major Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces do not yet allow Russian troops to achieve significant successes.
The ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full momentum, the Russian command has not yet put into operation part of the 2nd motorized rifle division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after deployment to Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in the Luhansk region now have the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces are setting the terms of battle, ending the period of the Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final culmination on the Svatove-Kremlin line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions," the report said.
According to analysts, this culmination could probably create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces to use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning report, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Russian troops, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive actions in five directions: Kupyansk, Limansk, Bakhmutsk, Avdiivka and Novopavlovsk in the regions of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Mar'inka and Vugledar.

SpaceX restricted the ability of the Armed Forces to control drones via Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
Advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podoliak on Thursday, February 9, urged the American company SpaceX to determine whether it supports Kiev in the war unleashed by Russia.
Thus, he reacted to the information that Elon Musk's company limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
"Companies have to decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to free life and Ukraine - and then do not invent how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its "right" to kill, seize territories," Podoliak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink should not be a weapon
The day before, SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which is actively used by the Ukrainian army in countering Russian aggression, "has never been intended for use as a weapon."
"However, Ukrainians use it in an unforeseen way, which is not part of any agreement.
We know the military uses it to communicate, and that's OK.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes," the director was quoted as saying by Reuters.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could "limit their ability to do this."
"There's something we can do and have already done," she added.
Exactly what measures the company has taken, it refused to clarify.
SpaceX "traded" from the U.S. defense Ministry for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX gave Kiev free Starlink systems to provide the population with the Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX told the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over the issue.
At the time, she estimated the required funding by the end of 2022 at $120 million, and over the next 12 months at about $400 million.
The issue of securing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, and in the European Union, but soon after the owner of the company Musk said that SpaceX withdrew its request to the U.S. Defense Department to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky believes that relations between Berlin and Kyiv are developing "wavelike" against the background of Russian aggression - they have "ups and downturns."
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
"By nature, I am a fast person.
Others are acting more slowly, which may also be related to their bureaucracy," Zelensky said, adding that Ukraine does not have weeks and months in the war, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every moment.
Revitalization with air defense
The President of Ukraine noted that at some stage the "conservative attitude" of Germany has changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz (Olaf Scholz).
"Then I finally received support from Steinmeier (President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier) - Ed. ), with which I had difficulties before, especially - because of the so-called "Steinmeier formula," - said Zelensky.
He stressed that "good work" had been done that allowed the relationship to change.
"We have received the IRIS-T air defence systems (ABMs), for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives," the President of Ukraine said.
According to Zelensky, Berlin managed to increase the pace of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T systems to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate over the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kiev has returned relations with Germany "to a difficult phase," the President of Ukraine noted.
He called the discussions on the matter "emotional and complex."
"I have to force him (Scholtz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this assistance is not needed for us, but for the Europeans," Zelensky explained.
Categorism regarding fighter jets
After the allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kiev with battle tanks, discussions began on the transfer of fighters, which Ukraine insists on.
Here Scholz took a categorical position: Germany will not in any case transfer combat aircraft.
At the same time, the Chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kiev "as long as it is necessary."
He made the corresponding statements after the meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of the leaders of the European Union on Thursday.

already nominated a new premiere - DW - 10.02.2023
The government of Moldova, together with Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilytsya, resigned.
This decision was made after consultations with the President of the country Maya Sandu, said Gavrilytsia on Friday, February 10.
"After a year and a half in government, it's time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, anti-corruption and integration into the European Union," she said.
She said the government had "faced energy blackmail" over the course of its work.
"They thought we would give up and act like previous governments who betrayed the national interest, but that was not the case. We worked in a mode of continuous crisis," - said Gavrilytsia.
She did not elaborate on the reasons for the decision to quit, citing only a lack of "support and trust at home."
Sandu thanked the Prime Minister "for the great sacrifice and efforts," also noting that Gavrilytsya headed the government during the crisis.
"Despite unprecedented challenges, the country has been managed responsibly, with great attention and selfless work.
We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and bankruptcy," Moldova's president said.

According to the law, the Cabinet will continue to perform duties until sworn in by the new composition of the government.
Sandu has already offered her security adviser, the current Secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and former Minister of Internal Affairs of the country Dorin Rechan to replace Gavrili≈£i.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, in which the party "Action and Solidarity" has a majority.
Gavrilytsya was her representative, so the vote for Rechan should not be a problematic issue, notes the AFP news agency.
Rechan has already stated that he plans to continue to seek Moldova's membership in the European Union.
According to him, the priorities of the new government will be "order and discipline, the breath of new life in the economy, as well as peace and stability," writes Reuters.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova is facing an energy crisis in 2022.
The country has twice experienced complete power outages across the country as a result of Russia's strikes on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly restricted gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to completely stop them.
Chisinau called the decline in supply volumes a political decision unrelated to payment issues.

In Turkey, nearly 171,000 tents have been pitched in the quake-hit region.
According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets were transferred to the crash site.
Meanwhile, in Syria, representatives of the White Helmets NGO, which is carrying out a rescue mission in rebel-controlled regions, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a White Helmets spokesman said that only two small international teams of volunteers without rescue equipment had arrived in the region to assist.
In addition, according to him, no humanitarian aid from the UN is coming to the region.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Center for Human Rights Monitoring, which operates in London and reports on events in the rebel-controlled northern regions of Syria, said that one shipment of UN aid arrived in the region the day before, but it lacks shelter tents and equipment to deal with the rubble.
About three thousand volunteers of "White Helmets" are involved in rescue work in northern Syria.
According to them, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people have been found, more than 3.3 thousand people are believed to have died.
More than 10,000 were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
In the early morning of February 6, a powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.8 occurred in southeastern Turkey, as well as in northern Syria.
This earthquake has become the most powerful in almost a century of observations.
The last time Turkey experienced such a force was in 1939, when some 33,000 people died.
For less than 12 hours, southeast Turkey was rocked by a second powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake that was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

Cyprus holds decisive round of presidential elections - DW - 12.02.2023
In the Republic of Cyprus on Sunday, February 12, the second, decisive round of presidential elections.
He was joined by the country's foreign minister, Nikos Christodulidis, and Cyprus' former permanent representative to the UN, Andreas Mavrojanis.
Conservative politician Christodulidis received 32 percent of the vote in the first round, his rival in the second round Mavrojanis, who is supported by left-wing forces, scored 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling party "Democratic Union" (DISY) Averofa Neofitu.
The DISY party, after the defeat of its candidate in the first round, could not decide who to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, reports AFP.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal suffrage.
He forms and leads the government of the country.
The winner of the current election will hold the post of head of state for five years and become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of the putsch supported by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the Turkish-occupied northern sector of the island declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Ankara.
The last negotiations on the attempt to reunify Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots participate in the elections - about 560,000 people.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote for them.

Energoatom reports new threat to ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
President of NNEGC "Energoatom" Petro Kotin called the reduction of water in the Kakhovka reservoir by Russians a new threat to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant (ZNPP).
"There are a lot of threats at ZNPP.
The reduction of water in the Kakhovka reservoir is a new added threat," Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the level of the reservoir is 13.8 meters at a normal level of 16 meters, "so that the station receives feed for its generators, for turbine capacitors and for security systems."
"In recent days, we have seen that the level has stabilized and is rising a little, because it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m," - quotes Kotin "Interfax-Ukraine."
He explained that the Russians who control the floodgates at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant began to discharge water less, at the same time the inflow at the top of the Dnieper increased.
The President of Energoatom specified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at ZNPP is sufficiently filled and so far there is enough water, but in the event of a reduction in the level of the reservoir to a critical point, this, he said, "will be a big problem for ZNPP."
Kotin stressed that the critical level will be 12 meters, emergency - 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will not allow a critical situation.

As "Interfax-Ukraine" reminds, the State Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority by order of February 10, 2023 banned the operation of power units No3, 4, 5, 6 of Zaporizhzhya NPP at power levels due to the inability to eliminate detected violations of nuclear and radiation safety requirements.

Israel to step up campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to step up its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, February 12.
"Today, the government is meeting to prepare for an even broader response to those who commit terrorism," Netanyahu was quoted as saying by Reuters.
That statement followed a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian man drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, among them boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the assailant was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
Officers shot and killed a man at the scene and arrested and questioned members of the Palestinian's family.
Israeli law enforcement officers jammed doors and windows at the home of a Palestinian family.
The next step after the seal may be the demolition of the house of the attacker, writes AR.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was killed by gunfire during a standoff with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired a rocket toward the Israeli border on Saturday night.
The Israeli army said the missile had been intercepted, dpa reports.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for weeks.
The Israeli army conducts near-daily raids in the West Bank, leading to repeated skirmishes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported killed during their attacks or in their own attacks.
In addition, Palestinian attacks in 2023 killed nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman.
Some 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022, according to human rights activists, making it the deadliest year for the territories since 2004.
At the same time, over the past year, 30 people were killed in attacks by Palestinians on Israelis, the AP writes.
Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, dpa notes.

Greek Foreign Minister visits Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - long-standing opponents, writes on Sunday, February 12, dpa.
On the same day, the two-state foreign ministers Nikos Dendias and Mevlut Cavusoglu held a surprise meeting in which, Greek television cameras recorded, they even hugged.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
Cavusoglu thanked Dendias for making Greece one of the first countries to provide immediate aid to Turkey after the disaster.
He added that the two states will try to restart dialogue and resolve their issues.
"Greece's help to the Turkish people does not end there," the head of the Greek Foreign Ministry said.
He said Athens would "do everything" - bilaterally as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit a disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the region of Antakya and Hatay.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
Political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope for several days that the assistance provided by Athens to Ankara could be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members have already shown solidarity with each other during the strong earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This aid, known as "earthquake diplomacy," helped achieve a certain discharge then.
Conflict over islands
Athens and Ankara have been fighting for sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean for decades.
Ankara questions Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos and Kos.
Greece seems to be violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the location of troops on the islands by threatening numerous amphibious ships on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
See also: Greece and Turkey on the brink of armed conflict?
Turkey almost daily reinforces its claims by flying fighter jets over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country's leader, Erdogan, has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Warming Ankara with Armenia
Amid the tragedy caused by the earthquakes, Turkey's relations with Armenia are also warming.
Ankara has opened a closed crossing for more than 30 years, through which humanitarian aid trucks from Armenia passed for those affected by the disaster.
In addition, Armenia reported sending two rescue brigades to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake that occurred on February 6 and killed more than 33,000 people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are strained for historical reasons - some 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
As the successor to the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits it has exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide was condemned, in particular, by the United States, Germany and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Amid the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation only got more complicated.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
In Brussels, a two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers began, during which a meeting in the so-called "Ramstein" format is also held on Tuesday, February 14.
The agenda of the event is to further increase support for Ukraine in the war and increase the rate of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting that NATO should provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war."
"We see no sign that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensive actions and new attacks," Reuters quoted him as saying.
"This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics," Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations on the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.

Ministers are expected to endorse long-term guidance for Alliance defence planning during the meeting.
"Allies will discuss investment in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure," Stoltenberg was quoted as saying by Interfax-Ukraine.
What to expect from the ninth "Ramstein"
On the same day, the U.S.-led Contact Group will meet at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov taking part.
Also, the head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry will join a special session of the NATO Defense Ministers.
"More than 50 member countries of the Contact Group are united with you in this fight for Ukraine's sovereignty and self-defense," Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of the meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership has previously expressed hope that at the next meeting of "Ramstein" partners could make a decision on the provision of Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that as a result of this meeting, the Allies will announce the exact number and timing of the provision of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants to ban Russian artists from touring in the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine collects data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote Russian President Vladimir Putin's policies, support Russia's war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations funded by the Russian state budget to include them in the new EU sanctions package.
This was reported in an interview with DW by Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Galina Grigorenko.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
According to Grigorenko, Russia is using culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum very clearly says that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation," Grigorenko says.
In her opinion, dialogue through culture with Russia is impossible.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
Recently, the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a trustee of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DPR" in the Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour
However, according to Grigorenko, this is not enough for those representatives of the Russian culture who support Putin's policy, still manage to tour in Europe.
"In order to officially cancel such tours, you need to have names in European sanctions lists," Grigorenko says, adding: "We are working to ensure that Russian cultural figures who promote Russian narratives outside Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will allow the EU to officially ban their economic activities, in particular the holding of concerts."
According to Hryhorenko, this issue in Ukraine is dealt with by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group under the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As previously reported, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9 that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at a summit in Kyiv.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of cultural and media figures of the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 names.

US ready to sell Poland HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment for $ 10 billion
The U.S. State Department has approved a possible sale to Poland of military equipment and services worth about $10 billion.
This was reported by Voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin with reference to the Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
It is primarily about the launchers of the M142 HIMARS high-mobility artillery missile system with ammunition for them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such an acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe," the agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the acquired equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and contain regional threats."
In general, Poland has submitted a request for the purchase of such equipment:
- 18 launchers M142 HIMARS;
- 468 sets of the HIMARS loading device module;
- 45 military tactical missile systems M57 (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of GMLRS guided multiple launch rocket system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
Also included in the agreement are missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and equipping personnel, support for system integration, engineering and logistics services of the U.S. government and contractors, training, sensors, other related elements of logistics and software.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is in addition to the launchers purchased by Poland in the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw has also invited missile launchers from South Korea, the newspaper reports.
NATO Secretary General urges US to be ready for Russia's long war in Ukraine
The possibility of sending Ukraine fighter jets to defend in the war against Russia has not been removed from the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"The first step in securing advanced aircraft is having soldiers or aviators who are able to use them.
It's a process that takes some time.
We started this process today," Sunak said of the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
"Nothing has been taken off the agenda and our leadership on this issue is something we should all be proud of together."
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks will arrive in Ukraine "next month" and said that Ukraine "should never again remain vulnerable to attack," and called "to arm Ukraine in the short term, but to strengthen Ukraine in the long term."
He said the UK had agreed to expand its training programme, which has trained 10,000 troops over the past six months, and promised, as CNN put it, to "accelerate the delivery of our equipment" to ensure Ukraine's achievements on the front line in the coming "days and weeks, not years."
During the press conference, President Zelensky expressed gratitude for Ukraine's support: "Today it is clear that we have the support of the United Kingdom.
"Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity."
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he reiterated the call for Ukraine to provide Western fighters and added that he "heard from the Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighters" to Kiev.
The Russian embassy in London has already said that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military-political consequences" for the whole world.
Now, Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba said on Twitter that Kiev continues to talk to Western partners about the possibility of providing warplanes: "I spoke to Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Gukstra to coordinate our international steps as a full-scale Russian invasion approaches the one-year mark.
Thank you for the last decision on tanks.
I also asked about the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation."
Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat said in comments to CNN that Ukraine would need dozens of Western warplanes to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say that the West has a short period of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the expected new Russian offensive in the spring or even in February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin is already trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine from early January.

"Politics and profits" stand in the way of vaccination
The director-general of the World Health Organization" said on Sunday that if countries did not use effectively existing tools to fight the pandemic, it could not be ended.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it," Tedros Adan Ghebreyesus said, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the tools we need - effective public health tools and effective medical tools.
But the world has not used these tools well," Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries around the world.
Obstacles to achieving the WHO's goal of vaccinating 40% of each country's population against the coronavirus are "policies and profits," a WHO chief has said, "not production."
"Countries that have already met the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, must give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue in favor of COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Fund," Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaborative initiative created to distribute the COVID vaccine equitably.
Ghebreyesus also stressed that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people, without cooperation to protect other peoples.
Together!"" Ghebreyesus noted on the social network Twitter.
The WHO official also urged vaccine manufacturers to "prioritise and honour their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [Africa's vaccine acquisition fund]" and become "much more transparent about what is being sent where."
AVAT is an African Union initiative aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official urged vaccine manufacturers to "exchange know-how, technology and licenses and waive intellectual property rights."
Earlier, Karren Attia, a contributor to The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share with the world the "recipe" for the Moderna vaccine.
"The US administration has been rattling about the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, it's not good-hearted philanthropy; it's arrogance.
Poorer countries didn't ask for vaccine-shaped charities; they asked for a fair opportunity from the start," the columnist noted.
"We're not asking for charity," Tedros said, "we're calling for smart investments in the global recovery."
As VOA reported earlier this year, the Biden administration called for waiving patent protections for COVID-19 vaccines.
Such a refusal should, according to the US administration, allow poorer countries to produce drugs analogous to patented vaccines.
Opposed to pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, etc.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University reported Monday that it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths globally.
Nearly 7 billion vaccines have been administered, according to the university.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said the decision to send F-16 jets to Ukraine would be a "very serious decision" that was "not easy to make."
One of Ukraine's closest allies said this in an interview with CNN amid discussions about new arms shipments to Ukraine.
According to CNN's Laura Kunsberg, in Warsaw, in an exclusive interview that will air on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16 planes would create a "serious problem" for Poland, because the Polish air force has fewer than 50 planes, and the Poles themselves "are not enough... and we will need much more."
Duda also stressed that combat aircraft, like F-16s, have a "very serious need for maintenance," so "it is not enough to simply send several aircraft."
These remarks by President Duda came amid discussions of new arms shipments by Ukraine, including Western tanks and anti-missile systems of greater antiquity.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has persisted in persuading its NATO allies to send Patriot installations and Western-made tanks such as Germany's Leopard tanks to Kyiv.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy this week embarked on an unannounced European tour in which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with the means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelensky called the combat aircraft the "wings of freedom" of Ukraine.
The same message Zelensky repeated in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelensky said he was "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hoped that the next negotiations on the provision of aviation to Ukraine would also be successful.
"I have heard from some European leaders about their willingness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
Now I have a series of bilateral talks, we will raise the issue of fighters and other aviation.
That's why we continue our work here in Brussels," Zelensky said.
As VOA reported earlier, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said last week that his country was ready to hand over its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Gukstra said his government would have considered Kiev's request for F-16s.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied supplying F-16 aircraft from the US, but Western experts believe that these aircraft could come to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that previously the weapons that the United States refused to supply eventually came to Ukraine if it was agreed to be transferred by European NATO allies.
Ukrainian military began training on Leopard 2 in Germany and Poland
Chisinau, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, Moldova's president said Moscow's plot to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, place the country "at the disposal of Russia" and derail its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maia Sandu's briefing came a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had intercepted plans by Russian intelligence services to destroy Moldova, which Moldovan intelligence officials later confirmed.
"The plan for the next period is to involve military-trained saboteurs camouflaged in civilian clothes who will resort to force, attack some government buildings and even take hostages," Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate power of Chisinau into an illegitimate one," Sandu said, "which would put our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration."
She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed."
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought to forge closer ties with its Western partners.
In June last year, it received the status of a candidate for the European Union, the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several cases of organizing criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence."
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a member of NATO, has faced a number of problems.
They include a severe energy crisis after Moscow dramatically cut its gas supply; soaring inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving "missiles that crossed airspace and debris that was found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another wartime missile in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said that Russia wanted to use Moldova in its war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the intelligence services contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry to Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control," Sandu said.
She said Moldova's parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the prosecutor's office, with "necessary tools to deal more effectively with risks to the country's security."
The president added that the plan would "rely on several domestic forces, but especially criminal groups," and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilana Shore and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are currently in exile.
Both men were sanctioned by the US and UK last year.
Last fall, a series of massive anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shore party also rocked Moldova amid an energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday came after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defence and security adviser, the pro-Western economist Dorin Rechan, to succeed Gavrilita.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova for years, which often involve the use of corruption in the form of weapons to achieve their goals."

Stories from the war: The grandmother with the red flag threw him away when she learned about Bucha
A staff member at the Center for Strategic Communications tracked down the same woman.
A living symbol of pro-Russian Ukraine, a woman who, according to Russian propaganda, bravely resisted the nationalists, is actually grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only support her products, but also protected from the anger of ordinary Kharkiv citizens.
Anna Ivanovna explains that she went out with a red flag to what she thought was the Russian military, so that they would not smash Ukraine .
And in the aggressor country, her motives have been twisted, which is why she now feels like a traitor.

The designated units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in Brest and Gomel regions.
There is a threat of the enemy's task of missile strikes on military and civil infrastructure facilities throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as the enemy's provocations on this section of the state border of Ukraine.
We abandon Soviet weapons and turn to NATO samples ¬ñ Zaluzhny
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhny held a telephone conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces
Zaluzhny's direct speech: "We also discussed with my American colleague the promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NAT models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will complete it.
I also informed General Milley about the difficult situation in the east of our state, in particular in the Izyum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-capable groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, keep occupied borders and positions."
¬ó Whoever came up with this hellish summer was clearly insane! ¬ó she complained to Dykora and stretched her arms out in front of her, as if she wanted to reach for the ghostly coolness.
¬ó You say the same thing every time ¬ó Warta remarked indifferently, stirring the ice in a cocktail. ¬ó In autumn ¬ó for rain and drizzle, the grasses rot.
In winter ¬ó because it is cold and the potion freezes out.
In the spring ¬ó because it's raining again ...
¬ó She would sit in all the Carpathians, ¬ó Varta shrugged indifferently.
She didn't particularly like the city, though.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and fuss.
The girl liked to imagine the familiar streets calm, quiet and greener, as a hundred years ago or before.
But there is no magic that would allow you to go back in time.
¬ó Phah!
You're going to say that! ¬ó The wild one clapped its palm across the table ¬ó and the flower vases strummed timidly. ¬ó If you had spent a week in my grandmother Rutmera's penitentiary with her colts, you would have prayed for every truck you drove, only to be taken from there to any city.
Unless you loved from morning to night the bedclothes, to pick herbs, to hang them under the ceiling and at the same time to sing the old customers.
Because the grandmother has braced herself with the horn that without words, none of my potions will be as they should be.
And wait, it's I haven't mentioned the rescue of all the rush at night!..
But where there, our Beloruchko, you would have died, another week would not have passed!
Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, and that they like such "work" that it is their conscious choice and the like.
But if you start to really understand this topic, it becomes scary...
Now the problem of involvement of Ukrainian women in prostitution is particularly acute.
The problem is there.
Our current president even had the idea of legalizing prostitution ... because of that, I didn't treat him very well.
I think we need to adopt the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of "Swedish model."
It is not a woman, but a client.
Women are helped to get out of this "business" and to make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything else.
Men should also consider what they buy - "pleasure" or violence...
There is a need for something else... you can see me where the nearest optician is with the doctor to write a prescription for glasses.
And you need to buy a frame, quality... I looked at some sites with frames, I was pleasantly impressed - it's cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $ 300 for them, the frame was medium (or even lower).
I don't know what frames are in stores, but prices in online stores are pretty normal.
But as for some cosmetics, I can definitely say that it is more expensive here.
There's a lot more to come.
We have multifocal lenses in glasses are very expensive (this is when compared to our average wages).
Taking into account the budget of our family (especially the fact that we need to hire housing), then $ 300 for glasses, then a fairly high amount.
Didn't your doctor offer you an artificial multifocal crystal?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then the intolerance of lenses began, a year after that I wore hard lenses, a strong allergy to almost all cosmetics began.
For 4 years I wear glasses constantly, I wear lenses very rarely.
Yes, I've also read that covid affects vision.
Also after 40 years there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than $ 1,000,which is very expensive.
Yes, glasses are fashionable now.
I asked a doctor why he doesn't wear lenses or make a laser correction, so he said that glasses - it's stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of 1500 UAH - this amount is unrealistic
I now have glasses masking wrinkles
Yes, it is.
My mother has little work experience.
She didn't work very hard: first the small children who often get sick, then she took care of her grandmother... so the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father receives 3800 UAH, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8,000 hryvnias and all these funds had to pay for the rental of housing.
In good times (before Covid) there were premiums, but with the onset of lockdown there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
Therefore, many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for their family or buy a cart, but then the connection with the family is lost...
Yes, there are pros.
But my husband has a day off, then she goes to the apiary)

According to the order from the day of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until the restoration of control over these seaports.
It is indicated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the inability to provide services to ships and passengers, to ensure an adequate level of safety of navigation and environmental protection during Russia's military operations in these regions, which pose a threat to human life and health.
The Russian Federation is using a troll factory to spread misinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
According to the correspondent of Ukrinform, this writes Reuters, referring to the statement of the British Foreign Ministry.
The British Foreign Ministry on Sunday said that Russia is using a factory of trolls to spread in social networks disinformation about the war in Ukraine and politicians of certain countries, including the UK and South Africa, - said in the article.
It is noted that these conclusions were reached by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the basis of expert research.
The ministry said that the study revealed how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign aimed at manipulating international public opinion regarding the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers operates.
According to the study, the troll factory used Telegram to attract and coordinate new supporters who later acted against critics of the Kremlin, throwing their comments in support of President Putin and his war.
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
Traces of the operation were found on eight social networks, including Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said her government had already alerted international partners and would continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations.
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadow troll factories to infiltrate our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war," Tras concluded.
Ivanna, I'll explain to you now.
You have such a structure of hair that all the hair is almost the same length.
Very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest possible result, you need or do hair phyllation.
But it will greatly affect the thickness of the hair.
So I didn't do that.
Or do coloring roots to make the transition more smooth.
At your request, I also did not paint the roots.
So the transition can be a little bit abrupt.
I can smooth the transition for you, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be dyed to your color, so when the hair grows the difference you won't notice.
About the quality of the hair.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
Hair can become drier, that's normal because it's blond.
Without loss of quality, such a blonde can not be done.
If you do the right hair care, and the condition of the hair will come to normal.
Write down, please, what kind of care from Matrix you use.
Maybe for a blonde, he's weak.
We can sign up for free tinting to make a smoother transition.
This photo is also quite a dramatic transition.
Because a large percentage of the blonde in the root zone.
Please let me know when you can come over so I can watch.
If we do toning, it will take about three hours.
There's a lot of positives from what I do in my job.
I help people - this is the most important thing and I wanted it.
In this way, but it is a help to people who almost no one in the world helps and will not say with a smile of the heart "good day."
I found today on the Internet excellent basic lessons of learning Czech.
I am here in the morning cleaning in the dormitories where homeless people sleep, at this time I am alone and the door to these 3 rooms is closed.
I listen to these lessons in my headphones and repeat them to the lecturer.
From the outside, I speak to myself, but it's good that at this time no one can see or hear me üòÖ I think an hour a day I can learn a language like that.
So another huge positive of this work is learning the language with headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ
Over the past 100 years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
The longest period of peace lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
Most of the modern territory of Russia at one time was occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural background of the Russians.
The cult of invading and raiding has been a success throughout Russia's history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then ¬ñ 20 years of Putin's regime.
These cultural features have shaped state institutions that cultivate a politics of hate and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of an invading war because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet fully felt the effects of economic sanctions.
Their standard of living has not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protest movements inside the Russian Federation.
So demand tougher sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia poses a threat to the new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military is shelling and seizing nuclear power plants in Ukraine.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was de-energized.
Fired from tanks and took control of Zaporizhzhia NPP - the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also recorded over the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacks on nuclear power plants.
The impact of a missile, overheating of a reactor or spent fuel due to failures in the supply of electricity and water can lead to radiation leakage.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia does not have to press the red button to cause a catastrophe of planetary scale.
Support Ukraine - Russia's threat can only be overcome together!
The Russians are looting Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and the first crops from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is Russia's conscious policy: for example, the local authorities of Krasnoyarsk Krai decided to expropriate surplus crops last year and this year from the south of Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take crops from farmers, but at the same time require them to successfully carry out sowing in order to then send new crops to Russia.
It prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement ¬ñ threatens physical violence.
Russia is repeating the policy of the USSR from the mass robbery of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
Thus the Holodomor began in 1932-33 and private property on Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of a liberation war with the Nazis, Russia in particular provokes famine in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country refuse any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine take children hostage.
They force their mothers to visit the locations of the Ukrainian military, for refusing ¬ñ they threaten to kill the children.
People are being pushed to make a tough choice: lose their children or become traitors to their homeland and be punished for it.
The Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine Lyudmila Denisova has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated amendments to the legislation to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from the Donbas .
Call on your authorities and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to enter NATO, but I do not like their indecision.
Because Nato does not close the sky over Ukraine, thousands die.
More than 50,000 civilians have been killed.
However, without Western weapons, we would be powerless, but I must say that it comes in insufficient numbers and late.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think that it is beneficial to the alliance itself, because with weapons from NATO and 9 years of experience of war against Russia, our army is the most capable army of Europe
Did you know that the Ukrainian invented how to recharge the one-time  anti-tank complex nlaw?
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage
The Russians deserve the worst and the sharpest that can be imagined.
So to some extent, I'm happy with what's going on.
Because this war is not 4 months, it began around the 15th century, I certainly do not remember now.
But all these hundreds of years goes by an attempt to make us slaves.
One generation does not have time to die, as another is born and takes the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have returned to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state
In general, it is wild for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the transience of events, I didn't even have time to understand, to reflect on the fact that there is a war and what it means to me
Here super,but you need to learn the language and go to work I can not sit on the support of the Czech state,but the problem is that my husband does not want me to sew to work constant quarrels.and it will be necessary to return to Ukraine and could stay but he will do everything to ensure that we go back.very difficult situation
I do not want us to live here such an answer
So he's glad that we're here but to sit constantly at home I myself took the children to school and swimming, I ask that we stay here after the war and he says that we will go home immediately, he will not make us documents
I will probably not be able to leave if he has a long time to do, and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic
Prolonged beating
I want when the war ends to study for a hairdresser and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic if he does not want then surely it will be necessary to go to the lawyer.now it is too early to do something.but here he clearly told us that after the war immediately go home.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when they lived in Ukraine he said he would take))) well now I know the truth
So thank you. we will get out of the situation, the main thing is that the war ends!! ! everything will be fine !! ! !
No, at the moment he has no one it's for sure.I think the reason is that the children want a lot in the Czech Republic ask him that toys then in poppy donalz go down, shout, run all over the house.and he's used to the peace that no one bothers him and does not ask for the lower one.And here we came and everything annoys him and we have to spend money and he's very economical.then it's better for us to live in Ukraine.
Outside the window of the train floated, dusted with a small gray rain, birch trees and fir trees, sprinkled with black and white confetti forty, cringey water-drawing and merchandise.
Comrade Orlrv, the opera commissioner, was lying on a narrow Spartan bed, which was familiar to him, because it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed in his home.
He unwrapped a simple set of business trip ¬ñ rye bread and lard wrapped in a gray rag.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and in life he was unpretentious, he had long forgotten how people rejoice in life and have fun so simply, because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he leaned over the old ruddy sakvoyage and carefully took out the crystal dome with two palms, which gleamed dimly in the gray light of the middle band.
- What is it with you, comrade? ¬ñ A young cadet, his neighbor, asked in fright.
"Raritet," said Comrade Orlov, with a tenderness unexpected for himself, securely placing the skull on the coupe table, "is such, see, a thing... Very interesting and flammable thing.
That, I might say, is my friend...
Yes, I look at work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately I find work for men, for special education.
I don't know the Czech language, I'm a teacher of young children, I'm not an engineer and I don't have a driver's license.
And also the big question of housing to find.
It's my first time abroad and I just don't know what to do or how to act anymore.
I haven't been able to find a job in a month, I've only been cleaning one house.
I understand that Prague is a very difficult situation, so I do not even go there
Here I have problems anywhere üò≠ I'm abroad for the first time, I don't know the language and I'm all alone.
Me and 20 other people were fired after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find work anymore.
I ask people, I look at sites - nothing
In this village I attend a course.
One lesson a week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, the situation now is that I have to hold on to free housing while it is available.
And watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options ((
I don't want to just sit around because housing won't be free for long.
I understand
I don't want to take money from you.
I do not want the opinions of lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in a normal city, not in the capital.
A difficult road from Ukraine for three days and a big city where a foreign language scared me a lot.
I didn't come here to visit cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Maybe you know someone in a small town?
I can look after the kids, cook food, clean, work in the garden...
I know how to sew, I have training to sew on a sewing machine.
I made bespoke bedding and some clothes.
Maybe that kind of work will happen.
I can do it!
Hugs and slut all congratulations!! üôèüèªü§óü§óü§óüíêüåû
So glad to read you!
We have air anxiety again now (((
Today more than 100 missiles arrived in Ukraine üò°
I worked with the wounded today, so it was difficult to concentrate.
All thoughts were with the child.
Ian was home schooled...
It's all going to be Ukraine!
We're serving up this filth!
In the surgical department, my colleagues and I volunteer
Sometimes covers of course)))
Then I clean, cook, communicate)))
This is my home, my land!
Congratulations to everyone - everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! üôèüèªüíêü§ó
Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the question of removing or not removing the association of Russian psychologists of European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is paramount.
I'll give you an analogy.
If in the sandbox one child takes a toy from another child, then most likely adults who watch children will try to kill children and for some time the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox begins to beat the other's face with a shovel, then such a child is isolated for a long time, and no one will play with it.
I also liked the analogy of one Russian psychologist colleague about the fact that when someone from a nearby apartment kills someone, then the whole apartment building is not put in jail.
Among Ukrainian psychologists there are many discussions on the exclusion of Russian associations from European ones, many feel how much pain that can not withstand communication with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to work with several psychologists from Russia that I know and share knowledge in order to treat the injuries of clients on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and I have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who at their level are trying to do a lot of things to develop universal values in Russia.
So I'm definitely for a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia the war is supported by 5-10% of the population, and other figures in social polls are dominated by propaganda.
My wife left her native Ukraine because the war is going on there.
His wife had a good job and no matter how much war she never left her home.
In order not to sit in the Czech Republic on the neck of my wife is trying to earn money, because once in 2009 she received a certificate in Ukraine about the completion of courses of masseuse.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money who can.
The only problem now is to learn the Czech language.
The wife teaches and works and earns herself and the child for food, for kindergarten, for a ticket in the bus, for mobile services for clothes.
At this time, I am defending my homeland.
Thank you for supporting people who understand this.
I thank the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine during a difficult time. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáø
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to advertise my wife's massage services to you in the community.
His wife earns money on her own because she does not want to live for the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you
Thank you very much to you.
It really helps my wife make money for her family.
All right, I'll pass it on to my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of Ukrainian people.
Some people smile at my wife's announcement, but my wife offers her services.
My wife was a nurse in Ukraine, I work in the police, but the war has separated us.
It's good that my wife wants to work and earn money rather than waiting for help from your republic.

Supervision of students in lessons, breaks and school events by school staff.
Safety conditions during your stay in the gym, playground and professional classes
Rules of distance learning
If this is not possible due to the imposition of an emergency measure or the imposition of a lockdown
personal presence of students in the school, the school provides interested students with distance education.
If the distance learning method is ordered at school (class), students are required to do so.
The most important safety rules
It is prohibited to bring items that endanger health and safety to school and school events, in particular
Weapons (including knives), drugs (drugs), cigarettes and alcohol.
It is illegal to smoke and use alcohol or other drugs at school and events.
I really need someone who could be a translator for a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, while we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we're dealing with an insurance company to fix the car.
Insurance invited a person who during the technical inspection of the machine can translate from Czech to Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa.
Can you help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific work based on statistical analysis of the body parameters of lizards of different ages and genders in a particular population.
In addition, I also have experience in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in the research of the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped to monitor the bat populations of the Kharkiv region, as well as to organize wintering for bats, which were cared for by people in the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in the important topic of biodiversity conservation.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to get acquainted with scientific papers about tardigrades, to observe their vital activity under a microscope and to communicate with the scientists who are investigating them.
So the option of deeper study of these and other microscopic organisms also interests me.
How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees - an analyst from an expert
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the Presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milo≈° Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken over the solution of many problems.
She provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
Approximately 500,000 people arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such strong support for their neighbors - Poland and the Czech Republic - and will tirelessly thank you!
As Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, the editorial office of ProUkrainu asked Yaroslav Kot - coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analytics, which has a representative office not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the life of the Czechs.
Labor governments have big queues, big price hikes in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.
This was foreshadowed.
Poland has said in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, less prepared for what will happen, and in Poland actively prepared.
For example, in the border areas of Poland with Ukraine even before the war began, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be placed.
In Ukraine, they didn't even think that this could happen.
I heard that they were smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very balanced: to prepare even before the war began for all these events.
It should be noted that extremely large funds from regional and state budgets were allocated to help Ukrainians fleeing from bombings from the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance in logistics - movement through the territory of Poland.
From Ukraine to Poland there are special trains, among them medical, for the wounded and sick.
These are planes that travel through the territory of Poland between cities, also charter flights to EU countries.
I had experience of cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is the largest like Lutsk, not a millionaire, as someone might think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, the payment for travel for Ukrainians has been canceled.
They can travel for free on trains and public transport.
In addition, Poland has agreed with German carriers that have organized free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to get to the places where they plan to stay free of charge.
The second issue is the residence of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
For the most part, these are closed school small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
There is organized free meals, free medical first aid.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
The major cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian neighborhoods have now been created.
The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they have managed to take from the Embassy of the Russian Federation the objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large apartment complexes have stood in a derelict state for decades, but no one was allowed there by the Russians.
The Polish authorities nationalized it, let's say.
It was taken in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings, which can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
There will be water, electricity, they are insulated.
Within a week or two refugees from Ukraine can already live there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm passed, and the Senate approved a law on fugitives from Ukraine.
According to him, Ukrainian citizens have the right to stay legally in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free drug assistance to Ukrainians.
You just need to write sms, get a code on the phone.
And in the conversion of 5 thousand hryvnia free to get the medicine in Poland.
Social assistance ¬ñ is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine regardless of age.
Widespread various funds, including Caritas, Red Cross, which give packages with food, chemistry, clothing.
As the Poles say: Niespotykana skala.
That is, event, which has no analogues .
Such a huge openness.
For the Polish state, this is a huge expense.
To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
The language is the problem.
The questions start with polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot help themselves without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems, diseases.
The second problem ¬ñ schools where students, especially high school students, also do not give themselves advice at all at the beginning, cannot understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the appropriate class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children not only have a good command of English, but in general their level is higher than the class in which they enter.
It's interesting too.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children learn well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked in Ukraine as a doctor, accountant, lawyer, it is much more difficult to master this job.
As a lawyer or accountant, I don't know of any such cases.
Doctors are now appearing in certain locations, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.
The language problem is often the reason that prompts families, after a few weeks here, to head back home.
There are so many such cases.
In the last few weeks we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military actions.
They didn't get comfortable here, they didn't find work.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, they are more comfortable to return home.
This is also one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.
How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed
According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, there have been significant changes.
While Czech society used to consider Ukrainians exclusively as migrant workers, today it prides itself on the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?
Poland has a similar situation.
Here, all television channels often quote the statement of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When the events of Russia's attack on Georgia occurred, along with President Yushchenko and other state leaders, he was in Tbilisi.
There he said the famous phrase that Russian aggression will certainly not stop in Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.
Then there may be the Baltic States, and may come to Poland.
That is, he would have predicted it.
In fact, Ukrainians now defend Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, help so selflessly Ukrainian refugees.
They see the threat in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.
Therefore, the attitude has changed to positive.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem, is now not a song of nationalists or any enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are still small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they are in every country.
But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think very differently about Ukrainians than before.
The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians have consistently argued that Ukraine has nationalists who need to be eliminated.
This is perceived in Poland simply with laughter, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they have no political subtext.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact has affected the change of public opinion of those sections of society who still doubted any historical issues.
Now it turns out that these doubts have not been confirmed.
The Ukrainians are heroes.
Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is now in Ukraine.
People from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities are constantly being talked about here.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for a worst-case scenario, as a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously considering their own security.
Russia fears it will use nuclear weapons to punish Ukraine for its support.
How does Poland's government and society react?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
Now in Poland there is an additional set of territorial defense troops.
That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
It is noticeable to citizens that the state is preparing for such events.
Among these and recently adopted a new law on the defense of the homeland, where the budget is significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.
The requirements for the recruitment of military personnel have been changed, many points that are actually associated with a possible military threat.
I know you as a specialist analyst of the future.
Your predictions became a reality in Syria, you warned about the Russian attack.
What will you say from the analysis of the situation: when Ukraine's victory and whether the world will be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for the nuclear strike, I don't believe much.
But there is such a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative of NATO countries, and so should Poland.
It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of Volyn region.
I wouldn't want that, mind you, but it's a worst-case scenario.
The impact of a small power, but that all television channels showed this hrybok.
It was seen from Poland, the Baltic States.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are related to the exhaustion of the physical and financial Russian troops, the problems of Putin's environment, oligarchs, who are now suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.
We have the facts of the burning of hydroelectric power plants in Sakhalin, some evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.
Such problems of a regional nature will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would collapse into 19 small countries.
We also have tendencies of peaceful settlement of war.
Various EU countries, in particular Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine due to their needs for Russian energy resources.
It will be delayed to the maximum until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing the possible cessation of gas supply.
This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Because I'm an analyst, I predicted it.
I just shut off the gas in my house beforehand.
My family will not suffer the loss of this resource.
But there are a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will experience rising prices.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely the prices for all resources will start to rise.
Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.
In addition, we already have several companies that bring liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.
As for oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.
Now there will be a purchase of gas stations in Poland, in fact, Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe were to give up Russian energy, it would be a loss of the source of Russian funding for its troops.
Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish media
Volodymyr Zelensky gave an interview to the Polish media.
What does the Polish media say about this?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased very much.
And this growth is estimated to be unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about the real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in a zone of military action.
That is, the actions of the president are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.
They say that the Ukrainian authorities are aiming as much as possible to obtain military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.
In the media, these topics are discussed in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity that sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.
You don't hear that here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, the ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.
It does not fade and does not fall.
This is the most important thing, that is, there is no image loss.
In fact, the image of Ukraine is maintained, and this is very important.
Good morning to you.
Sorry to bother you again with your problems.
I'm very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
Yesterday they tried to come to something, but the attempt was in vain.
My mother-in-law's girlfriend joined the conflict and helped me find this apartment.
She said that she was not looking for her for us, and if something does not suit us, we have to leave and she will do so that it is the mother-in-law, not us, who remains here to live.
Unfortunately, none of them think for a child who is accustomed to this place, considers it his home, and in 3 months of change already 6 homes.
I'm very sorry, I couldn't have guessed that this situation would happen
I'm sorry to bother you again.
And with regard to the bed the situation looks strange.
We discussed this issue with my husband before I wrote to you that the bed is not necessary.
He was driving here to see me and the baby and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law herself decided that he would sleep with her in the room and spit she wanted in his opinion and desire.
I am very ashamed of you, your husband, Sharka and Jan, the hostess of the apartment.
You tried so hard for us
I get it.
I thought it was going on for a long time.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andrew's treatment, to do so at least until the end of the summer?
Perhaps you need a certificate for Andrew that he is sick.
In Ukraine with such a diagnosis would appoint a disability.
And since Inna does not go to kindergarten for the time being, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the house
Of course, then it would be good to go tomorrow with you.
I'll do a bar code to myself and Andrew
I worry that they will stop providing humanitarian aid for him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a long time.
Can you give me any advice?
I also wanted to ask, did you receive money for the medicines you bought for Andrew?
The grip for the handle falls out.
It is short, so you need to be very careful and not lose it.
Only 2 servings sold today.
The apricot is over.
She poured mangoes.
Mangoes don't go very well.
They wanted most of the apricots.
Now they take more vanilla because they don't like mangoes.
Norm, it's gone mango.
But it started to creak againüò≠
Actively started taking ice cream and it doesn't work üò≠

He freezes again, squeaks.
Hadnes is on 4.0.
As soon as people actively take it, it does not let ice cream at all.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
It's just that it's just the turn of ice cream, it begins to give out such nuances and people go on.
It freezes over .
If there is no ice cream, it will creak and rub the piston.
And vanilla can not be poured into mangoes.
Maybe Magdalena will come tomorrow at 8:00?
We need to wash the ice cream.
Today the ice cream is over, and tomorrow the taste is different.

Mykola Mikhnovskyi first read the text of independent Ukraine in 1990

Leonid Kravchuk First President of Independent Ukraine
I believe that there was a dictatorship because people just came out of Russia and still really could not understand them like to be an independent country or they want to be an autonomous Republic of Russia
when Ukraine was independent Kyiv was already but in the Soviet Union there was a city Kharkiv from 1912 to 1934
I can't say that there were any more interesting events but if at first there was democracy was much better and for sure now we were in the European Union
