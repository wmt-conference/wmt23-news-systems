An increase in cases of rabies in northeast Thailand.
On February 9, Dr. Tawichai of the Ninth Division of the Office of Disease Prevention and Control reported that the number of cases of rabies in northeast Thailand has increased in recent months to a total of 74 cases.
This year (October-September last year), 67 people and 7 people, respectively, have tested positive for rabies in the provinces of Srin and Brilam in the north-east of the country.
All of them have been vaccinated against rabies in the past.
The doctor urges people to get the rabies vaccination with their pets and to avoid touching the saliva of suspectedly infected animals.
Rabies is not only transmitted to dogs, but also cats and bats.
While almost 100% of the people infected die from the disease, death can be prevented by immunization before the disease develops.

The Park Chung farm, located in the mountainous area of Shinjuku, is largely a steeply sloping field with poor soils.
These farms had an unprecedented harvest last year.
The achievements of the Qingdao Central Zoo Feed and Aquatic Assurance Company are great.
The operation was started in 2011 with the mission to deliver fish feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
In addition to implementing the fishing program, in recent years it has supported farms in the city of Chongqing, including procurement of farm materials.
However, this time the company did not help the city of Qingdao, but the farm in the neighboring county of Mirror City.
And also, I decided to help "split" Park Chung, one of the toughest farms in the county.

FUJI abandoned to prevent accidents system development experimenting with its own vehicle and the Central Economic Journal of Aichi, Gifu and Mitsugu.
Fuji, which manufactures and sells robots and machine tools, has started the development of a system to prevent "abandonment" such as children being left behind in cars.
It's a way to put a human sensor in your car, it can detect people's movements and send notifications to your phone and chat.
Currently, the company is conducting demonstration tests with its own delivery vehicles.
We will protect the safety of children in the event of traumatic accidents of abandonment.
Currently, the company is carrying out demonstration tests in the two delivery vehicles of "teracoya THANK" (Teracoya Sank) after-school school for children in Hokkaido.
Human sensor is installed in three places on the roof of the car to detect human movement from the temperature difference between the person and the surroundings.
When the car's engine is turned off and the doors are closed, a warning notification will be automatically sent when it detects a human movement after a certain amount of time.
It can be used to link the condition of the engine and the door to information to prevent false detection as much as possible.
The warning is transmitted through the cloud.
Calls are sent to a pre-registered number, and appear in the chat room of a computer or smartphone
This allows the user to register multiple addresses so that there are no mistakes.
The proof experiments will continue until the end of February.
The head of the second division of the Innovation Promotion Department, Tsuyo Itoi, noted that "during the experiment, peripheral problems outside of the system have also been seen".
They were able to pick up different tasks related to the school bus, such as creating an environment for drivers to concentrate on driving.
So you can just be like, "If you want to expand the solution".
The development of this system was inspired by a series of bus abandonment accidents in the country.
We were getting suggestions from employees with young children to what we could do to keep them safe.
We decided to develop the know-how we have cultivated through our FA (factory automation) related business, IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors.
FUJI's anti-abandonment system is sold for its ease of use.
The sensors can be mounted on the ceiling with a pin.
Since they can be easily back-up to a delivery vehicle, the goal is to reduce the barriers to their implementation and adoption.
In the future, we will consider productization while also seeking cooperation with nurseries and kindergartens.
The construction of the Dunga-Osaka Line, which had been planned for the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year, has been postponed and it has begun to affect the urban development west of Dunga in Fukui prefecture.
In the city of Hachio, where the new station will be installed, the location of the station is not indicated in detail.
The development of a project is expected to take a long time, and an early announcement is required.
The new station in the city of Hokkaidō is planned to be the only new station to be built west of Tōhoku.
In 1911, the Railway Construction and Transportation Facility Maintenance Support Organization reported the radius of about 2.5 kilometers to the center of JR East station as the location of the station.
The detailed location of the station and the route were to be determined in the winter of 22
In the city of Chiyohama, the opening of the Dongga and the opening of Chiyohama ahead of the new high-speed line related businesses will be legalized in the 21st year.
At the beginning of fiscal year 22, the budget aims to further increase the number of businesses and to advance urban development, including the publication of the location of the new station.
However, the exact location of the new station is not known yet.
The city has a budget of 3 million yen in the current year to consider land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station and prepare the basic plan. However, it is expected that it will not be implemented.
The city planning centered on the new station "will take time to achieve the consent of the citizens" (the city official).
Although there are examples of the newly built suburban railway stations in the prefecture that are not adjacent to the existing JR station, it seems to take a considerable amount of time to put together the overall plan.
It is feared that the later the announcement, the shorter the preparation period until the opening, and the impact on the surrounding development.
Before the location of the new station, a vague feeling was in the extension to the west of Tunga.
Citizen organizations in the city of Tokyo on the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land Transport in October last year, calling for the withdrawal of the white paper on the extension.
The government of Ishikawa Prefecture has been given notice of the start of construction, voices calling for the reconsideration of the original Miko route, and moves to return the settled route setting back to the starting point. It has never been a difficult situation for the neighboring prefecture.
Although the reception of residents to the landing is relatively calm, there is concern that the location of the new station is not known, and the opening time remains unclear, which may affect the future of the train.
Mayor Matsuzaki Shizuji plans to continue his appeals to the country for the early opening of the full line, but the voice of the local population asking for the opening of the line one day early will be essential.
The indifference of the government to "Some day the new Shinkansen will pass to the west of Doha" does not move the government of the state and neighboring provinces.
I want you to keep raising your voice.
A chocolate auction for Valentine's Day resumed for the first time in three years = February 9, in Fuji, Fukui Prefecture.
As the price of chocolate shops rise due to higher raw materials and packaging ahead of Valentine's Day on February 14, the high price bracket has been sold out for "rewards" chocolate for oneself and for family and friends.
Retail stores and confectionery shops in Fukui prefecture try to attract customers with products that display the local colors, sense of high quality and passion for materials.
The Shibuku Fukaisou shop opened a special sale on the 6th floor of the event on January 25.
As of April 14, it sells about 40 brands and 450 varieties, including 10 sweets shops in the prefecture.
Sand products such as chocolate with fuji earth spirit or sand bars with raw chocolate in cookies are popular.
According to the store, the store prices of many products have increased by 10% compared to the previous year.
For this year's trend, "there are many products that are characterized by their adherence to material, high-end packaging, or consumer trends that tend to buy, eat and enjoy for themselves and their families".
Despite the price increase, sales in the high-end segment are good.
⇒ Prices increased by an average of 25 yen per unit
The company's executive said "Our goal is to create a marketplace where people can enjoy the event itself".
The shop has been selling sweets for the day since January 26, and has resumed its tastings for the first time in three years.
At the end of last year, the Western Candy Association, headquartered in Saikai-shi, Muruga-machi, Chiyoda-shinai, introduced the original "KISEKI" series, developed in collaboration with old-fashioned French chocolate makers, to the Valentine trade wars for the first time.
It is characterized by a strong adherence to cocoa beans, with its fruity taste with bitterness reduced. It is sold in 3 pieces for 1,000 yen, 9 pieces for 3,000 yen.
The purchasing director for the company, Takahiro Tsugumi, explains "While the culture of bridal chocolates is gradually fading, there is a demand to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine's Day. We increase the added value of the products and try to differentiate".

On the 9th, a 20-something female employee of the city of Fuji, visited Fuji Shops in Fuzhou, saying: "I love chocolate, and because I have found a job and can make money, I want to buy it as a reward to myself".
The 30-something company employee who bought the chocolates said: "It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolate, so I would like to give it to the family or those who are usually cared for once a year, but there may be fewer people to give it".

The site of the Bukehara castle, thought to have been built in preparation for the battle with the Hikosun temple
An area on the dry side of the city of Odaiba, Fukui prefecture, which was once a large hideout for oxen.
It is believed that the castle was built in the middle of the pottery hills in the district to prepare for the battle with the Higashishan temple, which was in conflict with the manor of Hokura during the Kamakura period.
He appears in the military history "Taikaga-ga"
There is no documentation about the castle, but it is recorded in the 11th volume of Taipei Chronicle, "The Over-the-Country-Battle-Battle".
He was an official of the Kankuro shokan, and was sent to the Odaichi as a district head.
In 1333, the six-border quest, created in Kyoto to control the imperial court and the West, was defeated by the warlord Fujiwara, and the Shōgaku shogunate was destroyed by Shinto Tsunehiko.
Upon hearing the news of the destruction of the Six Wave Project, the members of the family fled and only about 20 survived.
By breaking through the gap, the monks of the Hokusai Temple have invaded.
He threw his wife and two children into the river and then killed himself.
A castle where Shinigami, Hideyoshi, and the rest of the family were standing, unassailable.
The local community "Care for the Dry Side" released "The Dry Side History Stuff" in 2014.
He tells a comic about the sad story of Takehiro, so that even elementary school children can easily understand it.
Mr. Nobukawa Nojiyama, who was involved in the publication, said "I want the people in the area to get to know their local history, and to tell it to posterity".
"Funky Castle Tour" to learn about the castles in Fukui prefecture
The Castle of the Bull.
The site of the castle can be reached by a hiking trail arranged by the dry cleaning society.
It is about 200 meters from the summit.
The road leading to the pass may be impassable in winter, due to snowfalls.
To take care of the dry side.
About 220 households in the dry side district of Ono have joined.
In the past, the district has published "Trisets of the Dry Side", featuring ancient tombs, historical sites and sights in the district.
The railway station "Lot-Suki-Ri-Oura", currently under construction in the city of Chijisaka, Fukuoka Prefecture, will open on April 22.
With the opening of the Jiawara hot springs station on the Hokkaido Main Line in the spring of 2024, the city is projected to receive approximately 360,000 annual visitors as a new regional development and tourist destination in the northern area of the city.
The main dining and merchandising facility of the station is a steel and plain house built with a floor area of 975 square meters.
The total area of the station, including parking spaces and a children's park, is 8,137 square meters.
The facility also has rest areas and tourist information booths.
Electric bicycles can be rented, and a shower room.
The two car parks can accommodate a total of 66 small and large cars (including 3 for disabled).
The Mayor of the city, Mori Sashiochi, clarified this at a regular meeting held on February 8.
In the food corner, pafferies made of fruits from the hills north of Sakai, as well as fried gold-tied pies and the like are sold.
We work on the development of a menu consisting of local food, such as egg noodles made with Fukuchi chicken, autumn-winter-only dishes made with Northern Funa-outside Cucumber.
Around 60 businesses are currently members of the Direct Selling Council.
It also enhances the taste of processed products such as lunch and vegetables, and agricultural and horticultural items such as seedlings and plants.
In the souvenir corner, the museum exhibits and sells the work of Kinzen's resident composers, as well as candy, wine and traditional handicrafts.

The station is managed by the Awa Running Cooperative established by President Miyaki Shinji, who runs the theme park "Ride of the Rabbit" which can be touched by rabbits in Kagagahara, Izugawa Prefecture.
At the meeting, the mayor of Mori said that "we will restore and promote vitality and vitality throughout the entire city of Awara and connect it to improving the lives of local residents and revitalizing the community".
A cat-like delivery robot is introduced at a "Jingiskangbo-do" in front of the Fukuoka station.
A loveable expression and such are well received by family guests.
The food industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a shortage of labor, is moving to introduce a delivery robot that delivers food to the tables.
The saving of the store management, the "non-contact" reception of the new coronavirus infection, the lovely face of the robot and others are favored by the family customers.
Some restaurant owners and stakeholders have said, "Rural restaurants will be struggling to secure employees and part-time jobs, and the delivery robots will become more widespread".
It is called "Gin, gin, Ginggisken".
With a light music playing, a robot with a cat's face on the screen runs smoothly through the store, loaded with dishes.
You arrive at the table, and you say to your guests, "We have brought the meal you ordered".
The Iwama-Sakura Gingi-Kambo-Buta Shop on the second street of Gangi-Sakura in Fukui introduced a cat-like delivery robot in August 2022.[4]
You press the table number on the screen, and the food you ordered from a customer is sent to a robot waiting near the kitchen, which then automatically drives to the table and delivers it.
The system is built-in with AI voice functions, which responds to the touch of a customer and also has plenty of cat facial expressions on the screen.
The "Muddle Group", which runs the store, has introduced a delivery robot in two stores, including the store.
Director Minoru Saitō explains the reason for the introduction: "The shortage of human resources is the biggest", emphasizing that it is part of the increase of productivity through shortage and digital transformation.
Although the percentage of sales in the store's human costs is usually around 30%, but the introduction has been reduced to 21 to 22%.
Robot food can also be used to help customers clean up afterward, "but it also has the pleasure and publicity for family members and children", he adds.
The "Six Star Sam Fujii Store" of baked meat and hormone sauce, located in Arakuki-shi, Fukuoka City, Japan, also introduced a distribution robot in August 22, 2017.
The director of Son-san department store, Sun Yam Yong-fu, says: "It is difficult to recruit employees or part-time workers. I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the shortage of human resources".
The Fukui store operates by separating the employee distribution zone and the robot distribution area.
The lease price of the robot is equal to the wage of one part-time worker.
To save money, the store has been considering the addition of a robot and a tablet ordering system, as well as self-frege.
According to the Fukushima Labor Bureau, the effective employment rate for "receptionist services" such as food stores, in December 22, is 6.94 times higher than the average job vacancy rate for other occupations.
A representative of the Net System, which is the sales agency for delivery robots (Fukuji, Kagayuki Central 2nd Street), said "the shortage of food and drink staff in the prefecture is getting more serious due to the influence of coronavirus and there are many inquiries for the introduction of robots".
Samaki analyzed, "the suburban shops in the countryside will be more difficult to secure employees in the future, and I think that delivery robots will become popular".
The town of Wuling has produced an ending note, and distributed it to those who wish to read it.
When a "Nuko-yūmi handbook", including the necessary procedures, written inheritance lists, and family tree diagrams when a relative died, was published last year, many people came to receive it for themselves.
In various parts of the province, a class on how to write the endnote and lifespan organization are also held frequently. "Lifetime" seems to be fully established in the people of the province.
The ending note in the old town is 35 pages long.
The five chapters begin with a review of our personal history, current health, financial situation, future care, hope for end-of-life care, and demands regarding funerals and graves.
There's also a section about what you want to do with the rest of your life, and a section to send a message to someone you love.
It takes the bone to write 35 pages, but you don't have to fill them all.
What do you most want to leave behind for your family and people around you?
The important thing is to be clear about the goal.
The bookstore and other places sell a variety of notes tailored to the purpose, and it is good to write from where you can.
The term "employment for life" was coined in 2009.
Two years later, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that more people have seen the reality that "death comes suddenly", and more people are preparing for their ultimate or end time.
That was more than ten years ago.
The new coronavirus that has struck the world is still raging.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine and other events have seen prices rise, and electricity bills have jumped to unimaginable heights this winter.
Half the world's wages are not rising as they have become, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, the costs of funerals and care services, and the care of the tomb, which were once shared by brothers and relatives, are no longer uncommon in the present age.
There's also the dilemma of life-expectancy rising a good deal from long ago, but the older you get, the greater your risk of dementia and of needing care.
I would like to keep in mind that these are also increases in social anxiety against the background of a transient and non-contiguous lifetime.
However, we all want to avoid imposing an unnecessary burden on our partners and children.
"Final-days to be yourself" sounds like a popular keyword from endnotes, but don't be too aloof.
I do not want to keep writing, I want to consult with the families, and calmly prepare for that moment.

Students and teachers are not required to wear masks at graduation ceremonies on February 10, 2019
On February 10, the Ministry of Education and Science issued a policy that children and students wearing masks during graduation ceremonies should "not to wear masks".
The head of a large secondary school explains that "It is actually difficult to get wide distance between students and we are wondering how to respond. Some students feel anxious to remove the masks".
He said the issue of the wearing of masks at the graduation ceremony has been highlighted even among teachers.
On the other hand, one school principal said that "if the state decides, the form would be not worn; it would not be feasible, except with chanting".
The graduation ceremony will be an attempt to recognize the participation of students who were absent, resume the graduates' choir, and seek to ease the measures in some schools in the province.
The prefecture high school will be held in early March, and the public middle school in the middle of the same month.
Provincial and municipal education committees will wait for an official notification from the Ministry of Education and Culture to determine their response.
Also, some caution was heeded regarding the Ministry of Education's policy of not requiring the wearing of masks in all school activities starting this spring.
According to the headmaster, "when suddenly without a mask from one day to the next, even the children are puzzled. After deciding, "Wearing is free", it is only natural that more and more children take it off".
It's going to be x.
The Ministry of Education and Science decided on February 10, along with the new guidelines of government to use masks, to require the wearing of masks in school activities from April.
No masks are to be worn during choir, physical education, or group activities.
During the 2022 school year, we will seek infectious control measures in accordance with the current hygiene manual. The next attention points after April will be circulated to the educational board and the school site.
The basic principle for graduation ceremonies of junior high and high schools and universities is that, even during the 22nd year, graduates, faculty, and attending students do not wear masks while taking measures such as ventilation.
Hair at the hair salon in Takatsuka City, Fukui Prefecture, for cutting the candidates who asked for a pass with a knife (left)
Each year, the hairdressers' salon, Hair Atrium, of Shizukake in the city of Takayama, Fukui prefecture, cut the candidates using the examination season and the passing of the candidate.
The student said: "I feel confident", or, "I was calm and took the exam".
Yamada Kan, the acting director of the beauty salon, has seen and heard students open textbooks while waiting for the cut, or express anxiety for the examination during the cut.
So in 2014, I started the "If it helps a little bit" prayer contest.
⇒ Final day of the national public tenders
In the same year, the first day of work in the local office of the city of Yokohama, the beauty salon has been asked to perform qualification prayers.
80 people get cut every year.
High school, college exams, job and driver's license exams, etc.
I am giving you a pencil that I prayed for you to pass.
"To you who challenges me to take the high school exam".
A 21-year-old man who had received a "cut" and was accepted to the University of Tokyo in active duty said, "I was happy to have the feeling of support. I used the gold pencil I received in the exam and it inspired me".
A book, self-published by the NPO, "The Heartwarming Collecting and Editing Bureau", "Dear Prime Minister, "The Barrier of Life" From Tohru Jun".
He self-published his 10th book, "Dear Prime Minister, "The Wave Dam of Life".
It has been picked up by newspapers across the country, and it's gotten comments from a lot of readers.
The purpose of publishing this book was to share with you the facts that I have heard directly from the suicide attempts about the causes of suicide in Japan, about "social and structural" environmental issues, and to create a "comfortable society".
We have been patrolling the waters of Fukushima Prefecture - Tokyo's capital for 18 years and 10 months, to prevent suicide, to find and protect those who would commit suicide, and to rebuild them.
This book is a summary of the issues that have been heard from 784 people whom they have protected (up to now), and addresses the following seven points to the Prime Minister on the national measures required to prevent suicide:
(1) Suicide prevention is a life-saving activity.
(2) "A lot of human rights violations" are behind the suicide.
(3) Suicides are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) The administration treats and mistreats its citizens living outside its jurisdiction as "foreigners".
5) Drugging or suicide of persons with mental illness such as depression is treated as an "accident".
(6) The "duty to take precautions" in areas of high risk of suicide has been forgotten and commercialism has been pursued.
(7) The part of the doctrine of a newly-formed religious organization that cannot be scientifically proven is deceit, and the practice of threatening and offering gold objects, by telling the future is blackmail.
We should expose and eliminate these religious organizations that have been guilty of this "crime of fraud and extortion".
Therefore, the comments that came from people who had subscribed to this book, such as "I was inspired by the strong mentality of those who work on this project", "The image of this former police officer is a testimonial of the police", "Being so stranger to be able to help as much as your family is a living god", were written to us, and here are some comments.
I saw the pictures in the newspapers and said, "What do you think...?"
Now, we're hearing that suicides are rising among people trapped by the coronavirus.
It's really sad.
Everyone is what they are.
I want a society where people are able to live their lives with pleasure.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude for all the staff who are devoting their heart to those who have suffered so much that they want to die.
I think this is a physically and mentally abusive activity, but please continue to speak up.
Thank you.
There you go.
We hope that you, the readers, will be the gatekeepers of life in the region.

Kondo Kenji, who takes pictures of a capybara every week and posts them to social media, is an "Hapijan", an indoor facility in Fukui City, Fukui prefecture.
There is a man in the city who takes photos of a capybara every week at the "Hapijan" indoor facility at the Fukuyama Park in Fukuoka Prefecture, and shares them on Instagram.
In the posts are several colorful samenail images, such as moments of yawns, teeth clattering from a large mouth, and a frown while falling asleep.
She has more than 10,000 followers at home and abroad, and is helping spread the word about the capybaras.

He is a company employee who lives in the city, Mr. Yamada-kun.
It started broadcasting on the social media site in March 2021.
The capybara is the world's largest rat companion and is an expert swimmer with a drop of water between its fingers.
Hapijan has been raising three animals for the first 18 years of its operation, one male and two females, which can be observed and fed in close quarters.
Mr. Yamada learned of the capybara five or six years ago.
She said she was shocked after seeing a video of her touching the hot spring: "What is this animal?"
I was drawn to her human, loving expression and gentleness.
I heard that they were going to be breeding in Hapijan, and I was looking forward to seeing them up close.
I started taking pictures seriously about three years ago, when I bought a reflex camera.
He uses the image to capture the beautiful image of the capybara, and does not miss a shutter chance, such as shaking the body and cutting water like a drill.
She wrote about 830 posts on Instagram, enough to look back and say, "I took so many pictures!"
While going through the gate, did you remember Mr. Takeda, when the male and the female approached and shouted, "Kyuuro-kyuuro".
"Cute and happy", says Yoshida's love for Kapibara as well.
We also enjoy communicating with capibaras from all over the country through social networks, showing their best shots every month.
Akita, who was going to the zoo in the nearest prefecture to see the capybara, smiled: "I want to continue to photograph and broadcast the crowbars of my home mainly from now on".

The Berenyo Hotel subsidy and the shitty housing subsidy from the provincial and city government have already been fully refunded.
The prefecture and the city of Ibaraki announced on October 10, that Berino Hotel Ibaraki (the same city in Ibaraki) had been improperly utilizing its respective subsidy delivery business, to deduct the accommodation expenses of travelers, for about a year since October 2021.

The plant research leader introduction and collection materials from the early Ikebukuro and the Municipal Complex Cultural Heritage Center Project Exhibition 花巻  Iwanichi Online 岩手日日新聞社
The project exhibition "People who introduced the flowers of Tokugawa-cho-chō-shin - A History of Tokugawa-cho-chō Plant Research", which discusses the pioneers who laid the foundation of the study of plants at Tokugawa-cho-chō, known as the treasury of plants, is open until 12 at the city's Comprehensive Cultural and Cultural Center in Okinawa-cho, Okan, Osaka.
It also collects 124 precious specimens collected by predecessors and presents the footprints of those who were involved in the study of plants in Takayuki-ji Mountain.
Botanical research in Ukiyo-e begins with the Russian botanist Karl-Johan Maximovich (1827-91), who came to Japan at the end of the series, and the Japanese plant collector Susagawa Nagasaki (1842-1925), who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovich.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to move freely in the country because of the foreigners, asked Tosagawa to collect the material and continued his research for three years, based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sukawa continued to support Maximovich in his research after his return to Japan, and this led to the release of the "Himekozakura", the "Numbatui", and the "Miyamyamama-maki-shōmu", unique to the area.
Later, modern plant taxonomist Masashi Futoharu (1862-1957) published the collected materials of local researchers in 1903 based on the collected material of local researchers, such as "Nambutranoo", "Kobanotsu Meka, "Nambuinazna", and "Katouhakobé" which he named in 1938 after he had climbed and discovered the volcano at Takai Pike.
The exhibition materials show that many researchers have discovered some valuable highland plants.
Sugimura Matsuo Hoso (1874-1948), the director of the Hakuraku elementary school, who was a plant scientist, and Yutakawa Shiro (1914-1988), a member of the academic staff of the Osaka Municipal Museum of the Mountains and also participated in the publication of "The Plants of the Tokugawa Peak", were also introduced.
Researcher Yūga Junpei said, "There is a lot of research and people-to-people connections behind the names of each plant in Ukieki-fū mountain. We can follow the connections between researchers spread from the countryside to the entire country".
The exhibition is divided into four chapters. The first chapter focuses on the faith and history of Akashi-Ike-gun. The second chapter focuses on the features of Akashi-Ike-gun from the geological perspective, based on the research of Heinrich Edmund Nauman, a German geologist who laid the foundation of Japanese geology (1854-1927).

So, to attract people to the island, "Hawking Real Estate" opened Okano Nara branch to recruit people wanting to rent a house.
A number of speakers discussed the concept of "Saka real estate" in a talk session.
The 8th event of the Okinawa branch of the real estate web service "Sakamoto Real Estate", a well-known community space "entaku", was held to visualize the thoughts of people who may want to challenge hiring vacant houses, vacant stores, and other things and to recruit lenders.
Through a talk session, the management company gave an overview of the service.
The director of the Tsuginoba branch in Ritsuko Shire, Daikichi Kawashima said, "By doing this initiative in Okinawa, we can create a movement that will draw people to the entire island".
In contrast to the usual real estate procedure, it is a process whereby the information of the person who wants to borrow is disclosed and he is contacted by the lender, and if they come to an agreement, the arrangement is contracted with each other.
Operated by the On-Co Corporation (headquartered in Tsugawa Prefecture), the service started in June 2020 as a demonstration experiment to discover potential vacant houses and build relationships through vacant houses.
This is the seventh branch, and the first in Kyushu.
It is the first time in the country.
The event was attended by about twenty staffs of On-Co and Tsuginoba, as well as officials of Okoro, the two towns, and local residents.
The representative director of Daikyubo explained how the establishment of the branch office: "When the movement to attract people from outside the island became activated, I thought that if we could use the vacant houses and vacant shops, maybe the town and the island would become more enthusiastic".
We want to link up with the people who have a property on the island and who want to do something and to help one or more of them move forward in the effort.
"We need to take care of each and every house and have local people talking about what they want to do with the area, what kind of people they want to come and what criteria they choose", On-Co's Watari Yuechi representative pointed out of the concern for management.
"The deeper the people are connected, the more information they gain", he said, inviting the islanders to participate in the discussions and provide information.

The problem is one: if the wristband is not quite slender enough, the grip on the sleeve (just the two arms) is too tight, leading to a slight tingling pre-exposure, itching.
Two: the lower abdomen has stopped being used in the above two problems.
It's pretty tight on the ground, but you can sleep in it.
It goes to the right people.
I could handle 5'5", 50 pounds.
But the big, muscular skeleton was no match for me.
It's not a three-dimensional structure, so it doesn't have weird gaps or it doesn't go down as quickly.
I always felt like I had to lift her up.
You'd like to be a stick figure.
And in terms of thickness, it's a really comfortable thin.
The result was that I could make it look like a nice boots, and not like a henna or a chapped one.
This is lovely.
I was going through the upper body, I don't want to reveal too much skin, but I was looking for something other than a fitness swimsuit.

But, you see, it doesn't hurt to wear it, and it keeps you in line with the bust, so I hope it looks good when you move.

It is not.
I'm looking forward to going into the water. Thank you.
45 kg 156 cm M size is slightly larger.
The raincoat is made of thick clay and feels hot and steamy, but it has a good fabric, which allows you to use it for a long time.
It had two rain visors to keep my face from getting wet.
I was able to ride a bicycle without any trouble, even in a storm.
It was never broken after use.
I put in a compact bag, and I carry it with me.
Really, at this price, it was more than I expected.
I've got it.
It was installed in the CLA 180 shooting brake for the 2016 event.
If you can read YOU tube and the manual, it can be done by amateurs.
A little bit of caution, if you loosen the torque wrench too much, it will fall into the car.
I dropped one and disappeared.
When we plug a gray connector into a brown and red-green wiring, the ends of the radio pencils, etc., with a tapered type are not evenly applied, as in the photo, the plastic will be broken and it will not be able to be attached.
You call support, they mail you a new cable the next day, and they have been very supportive.
At the second challenge, I was able to do it with a wide pen in the same spot as shown in the manual.
This one was a little bit of a hassle for the wire when I put the last main unit back in the car.
The DVD, TV, and Navi are displayed even while driving.
I think this is a very cost-effective product because it costs over 80,000 yuan to buy a concession, or over 40,000 yen in a specialty store.
Less than the price.
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated, but the inside one, it's polyester, there's a section cut off inside the pillow, and it has all these little bumps and squiggles and it looks like they're already outdated, so it's less carpet overall, and I thought I'd try it, but maybe I can't, but I think that I'm going to try something that has a head-on-pillow component and it might not work or that doesn't, and I think that pillows and pillows should work better separately, so I bought it this time at a time sale for 3600 yen.
It doesn't matter.
The goods have arrived.
I'm happy to use it as soon as possible.
It's very easy to use and can be milked without any problems.
It's just that sometimes it's a little annoying, and the power button doesn't respond.
I don't mind it, because I use it without any problems.
It's not super quiet, and it might be a little annoying if you use it at night.
And also I was worried that the attached tube and the machine parts would be in the tube, but it was in a stuffy way.
You need a little trickery to make a bubble...
I'm not sure if my hair is just so uncoordinated, or if it's the performance of this shampoo, but with ordinary usage, I don't really make any bubbles at all.
Well, this is the solution I have found, which is to first, use a little less shampoo than usual and rub it all over your hair.
You wash your hair twice, and then you shampoo your hair with appropriate amount of shampoo and condition it.
So you have to go down to two washes -- (Laughter) So the shampoo itself has a much smaller volume, so the trick is to use as little shampoo as possible on the first wash.
I bought a much more expensive shampoo, but I was obviously feeling a better feel to my hair.
But, honestly, I'm not satisfied with the overall rating.
It's a pity the Qua-troth Botaniko Series was only taken care of by the Facepalm guys...
The evil of the little flask that has to be washed twice.
However, considering the smell of the smell, I will give it two stars.
It's hard to judge.
There is a negative, and it's difficult to evaluate.
After all, the cleaner will clean the surface of the blade.
I like to match the original blade with a good blade sharpener.
Positive: Remove the dirt from the blade, such as grease, soap bubbles, and so on.
If the taste is bad, it will last for a long time.
Negative: The life span of the SMouser is drastically reduced.
Titanium coats, ceramic coats, etc., which have a coating on the blade, make it easier for the coating to peel off.
(I think we can get most of the coating off after only a couple of shaves, and then, it's better to use this cleaner.)
A note on the pencil that says "Do not wipe the edge of the blade".
When the material can be replaced by anti-fall (vibration) rubber, which we put under furniture, etc., which is used for earthquake preparation, the cost and performance seem to be similar.
Here is the life of the compass, up to 20-30%.
It's difficult to determine when the blade of the chisel was discarded, but I think it was when the razor added damage to the blade and became tangled.
And, in that sense, I think it's a good product because it helps stop the dirt from breaking down.
(In fact, it does not have sharpening effect in the cleaning machine, but sometimes it feels like it is sharpening, that is, I feel like it is when a small razor is removed.)
She was on a TV commercial...
I had only painted one of the faces of a fairly elderly woman in a TV commercial, and I bought it.
When I use it, the texture is a little harder than the regular gel, and I use it after I have scrubbed it with a pre-irradiant.
You might feel uncomfortable at first, but after you apply it, it feels like a massage, and then it goes into the skin.
And it was almost impossible, but it felt like my skin was getting sucked into my hands.
The lift up was not the same as the TV.
I only felt the sensation once.
This is not enough for super dry skin, and I've used a certain moisturizer 72 before.
It's just like getting wet.
I was hoping that the edges of the pores would be covered, but they're not.
I wonder if a bottle would do the trick, or a recipe for it.
And it's been a lot of work putting it all together, but...
This is a summary of what some politicians have said over the last few years.
As I read, I somehow agree that what he said at that time was, uh...
However, considering the value of the readings, it's a delicate question whether fact-checking, as the authors call it, is necessary.
To be honest, it's not that fun to read.
I was thinking about it, and I felt that the biggest flaw in the book was in the methodology.
No one ultimately knows whether what we call "facts" here are eternally true or not.
I felt quite dubious about writing this to see if they were aware of the fragility of "fact check".
Now the perception of Japanese journalists of "facts" at this level, I feel a little dim.
Although it seems like this book is recommended to many, it might be for people who want to have a little bit of knowledge of what the book is about.
If you, like the reviewer, are interested in the kind of "fact checking" done by the current Japanese media, this would be a good read.
For those who didn't score higher on their test.
In my school, I didn't really like political economy in the printed form, and in this lecture format that I was being taught, and so, I eventually hated political economy.
To be honest, this reference book saved my life.
High three now, center this year.
I bought it in March, and I chose it as my partner for my one hour study trip to and from school.
The first impression is the easy one.
You're reaching the realm of the gods.
And at the end, when I was done, and I had a background check, my average was 40, and I was 70.
Even I was surprised at the stone.
It's about as long as a weird food.
I have a strong sense that what I have gained from this book is not just my knowledge and information about political economy, but also the power and motivation to do what I do, the motivation to study.
Thank you so much for the tour.
The guard.
We've had two attempted burglaries in our community eight years ago, and we have taken precautions.
This is a replacement from a camera I bought eight years ago.
I used to use the 30-meter infrared radiation.
And it says that the product can recognize faces at a distance of about 5 meters at night.
I agree with you.
I just arrived and I haven't set it up yet, but it's at the stage where I can compare and test the camera's accuracy.
And the quality is much better than the camera eight years ago.
We showed a 32-inch monitor in four parts. If you can maximize the screen size, it won't be a problem.
So far, no problems with the product.
And the way the level of facial recognition is being conditionally assessed, other than security, might cause some dissatisfaction, especially in night photography, which is, at this price, the highest of the best!
I'm a security officer, but I'm not asking for facial recognition.
I can't tell if it's a cover or a mask, especially at night.
A professional thief has knowledge of security cameras.
They can tell the difference between a high-performance camera and a tiny camera.
On the other hand, if you're not a professional.
However, because the current empty nest is ambitious and ingenious, I recommend that instead of relying on the camera alone, you combine it with other pieces of security gear.
So for example, we've got this white solar LED garden light that you can get from a home center for about $1,000.
And this is solar, so you don't have to pay for electricity. It's not lit up till morning in the winter, and it has three 100-volt human-sensing LED lights attached.
With this combination, we are able to detect the human shadow within a distance of 30 meters.
And if you're a security guard during the day, and you feel that a tiny camera may not be as intimidating, you need to be very clever about what you do.
I have a 24-hour security camera sticker.
This is the original from the security camera company that I used to work with.
It's more effective to have manufactured goods than to put things up for sale in the home center.
The place it's affixed is the entrance to the theft that cameras will not be able to cover.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
In addition, the narrative of the internet is difficult to understand, so we decided to negative.
If there are any problems after installation, we will report it.
The more I read, the more I empathize.
If you were born in Japan in 1982, your social situation may be slightly better than her, but due to the enactment of the Gender Employment Equality Act, the situation is still far from equal.
As I continued reading, the painful memories of having survived as a person in society amidst discrimination came back to me.
It portrays the suffering of all women in feudal society, not only in Korea and Japan, who want to live as human beings, but not as women.
Perhaps it is time for women to at least stop their emotional conflicts and stand shoulder to shoulder against this society.
And I think men are the worst.
The story of a woman who was sexually abused by her biological father as a child.
And, of course, as an adult, you continue to carry that trauma.
Every man who comes out is the worst.
The warm and family-loving husband of the protagonist is also, in a way, the lowest.
He is told: ↓ Ignoring the fact that the main character's sister is DVed by her husband, her sister-in-law finally finds the courage to bring her husband to the police, the husband of the main character is a police officer, and so on. The development of the plot will irritate the men.
The hero's old mother, who is pretending to be stupid, knows that her husband (the real hero's father) was killed by her daughter, but that she does not know (publicly the death of her real father is drug overdose).
In other words, after the death of the rapist father, his daughter was never allowed to go to counseling.
Do you want to know about your grandfather who was killed by the lead character's daughter?
Do you care about this old man who died so young?
There's too much drama.
A couple of years ago, in the summer when a heat wave hit France, it was reported that the number of elderly people who died and the number of deaths in hospitals, institutions, who contacted their children were so many that they said, "We're not available", and that the morgues in Paris were full.
These people are called "dry".
And at the end of the play, I looked at my husband and daughter and I felt like I was "dry".
The French movie is very different from the US movie or so, with a lot of the sordid scenes and some good extras, so there's a relatively high number of scenes that you want to cut, and you look at them in quick succession.
The boundaries of the professional.
If an elaborate calculation and an even then inconceivable unexpected accident had been involved with someone's life, he was prepared to risk his own life, even if he had some calculation in the first place.
The script embodies the drama of such a subtle mind, the struggle with her own conflicts that cannot be shown in public, and the extent to which she deceives others in order to pass her convictions.
On top of that, Jessica's performance is really amazing.
I don't care what I see.
This is a professional job.
And then it broke down.
So, I have used three of them so far, and the product has been broken in no time, for better or worse.
What inspired us to choose this product was our first in-built vaporizer with a 2.2 million pair. The battery died after 3 sessions at 200 degrees and 5 minutes.
The second USB port is bad.
It won't charge.
Now, this product was the solution to the problem before, but when we replace the battery 15 times (so as to prevent the USB terminal from breaking, we use the battery in the charger), the contact is bad and it is difficult to access.
When we open the lid, the power goes on.
I hope some of you have the experience of using Icos.
That's the symptom.
And the note says, the battery does not use batteries other than those in the enclosure.
The claws and the part of the handle are like the notch, so there's no bend.
So it took about 10 days to get it back.
I purchased the item at the same time as my return and without the Starley logo, so the comparison is here.
It looks the same, it's the same size.
Same with Chambers and Drew.
This is cleaner.
It might be newer than without the logo.
Vibe, this is the...
It's like a cell phone.
Without the logo, the vibration and the sound are great.
It's a cheap Chinese phone.
This product is Chinese, but...
The ingredients are slightly different.
This is the Liquid case.
Without the logo, it's like steel wool.
Something like that.
I would have preferred Starley, but if you break it fast, we lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I had no choice but to return it, so I had to process.
It's an ear rubber or an ear gum.
This rubber really doesn't hurt.
This is the best ear-pleasing mask of its kind I have ever used.
The flat rubber may be wrinkled and the scraping portion of the scraping is in the earlobe, which is sometimes more painful than the round rubber, but I think the material is not only soft to the touch, but the length is exactly wrinkle resistant.
It not only fits well in the face, but also allows a moderate amount of space between the nose and the lower edge of the nose. It makes the breathlessness difficult to feel in front of the mouth.
They say, "It's the size of your face. "
Now, I don't know if that works for all of you, but if you think other, smaller sizes are all unimportant, you might want to try it out.
We opened the box, and this box was wrapped in a tissue-like central slit vinyl, but when we took out the first one, the earmuffs on both sides of the box became stuck, and it wasn't easy to pull out, so I only had to take one of the stars.
The response is one star.
Even though the prices and the taste were quite good, despite the date it was ordered, we did not trust the response of the seller who ignored it.
I've bought a lot of drinks in addition to this product.
I always buy from Amazon, so I know the delivery guy, face-to-face.
We've tried to make as close to arrival date as possible to carry the heavy stuff to the top, but we failed.
Amazon is making it very difficult for shipping companies to do this, and so I wonder if there's one thing we can do on the user side to help.
I am disappointed in the arrogant response of the dealers.
But the price is cheap.
So, we're going to buy a car.
I have a lot of complaints and I think I won't be able to use it for long.
It's a good idea to consider the cost of disposing of that.
For reference, some municipalities have a center that will accept free or cheap coarse garbage if you bring it in.
My seat is tilted slightly to the left, so it's even tighter, and I feel very tired from sitting.
If you move a little, it makes a loud hissing noise.
It's noisy at night. I can't use it.
This is the biggest trouble that I have, and I don't feel like I can continue using this.
[assembly] The assembly manual only describes the rough drawings.
There is a lack of information needed to assemble it and there are many misspellings.
• The orientation of the seat and support anchorages during installation is not explained. Some people say in the review that it is tilted forward, but the orientation of the seat and the support anchorage during installation may be opposite.
When properly installed, the height adjustment lever is located on the right hand side, facing backward, and the dial in front of the rear spoiler alignment.
However, the height adjustment lever is more positive in nature and many people will misplace it.
A manual would have these basic precautions, but it would be done through trials and errors while looking at random pictures.
The description of the contents is wrong, and the list of contents at the beginning of the book is incorrect.
Many buyers seem to be looking for 12 8x20mm scissors that come with it.
8x20mm scissors are already inserted into the side of the chair, so be careful not to go looking for them in vain.
The precision of the machining is low, there are combinations that can be inserted and combinations that cannot be inserted even in the same screw hole and the same screw.
In some combinations, it is very difficult even to insert a screw into the screw hole.
So, we can imagine shipping it like this with a screw in it.
I didn't see the spinach in the instructions.
[Other] The black portion of the surface of the vinyl laser is coloured, almost white, and don't expect to be pretty like a trade photo.
An explanation of the defect in the instructions, and a supplemental explanation of the above payment method, etc., was sent to the email address registered with amazon on 2 or 3 days after the arrival of the products.
These things should be sent out immediately after the goods are shipped.
In two or three days from the arrival of the goods, many buyers have completed the assembly, so it's a completely meaningless act.
You know...
I am a huge fan of thermos and have been using thermos flooring for over 15 years, and this model is by far the most difficult to use of all the models that I have ever used.
The mouthpiece of one straw has become so hard that the slit has become so tightly connected to the body that you can't take the mouthpiece of the straw out of the body at all!
We would lose our nails trying to get it.
Only the end of the two-straw mouthpiece is thinner than before, and the straw brushes don't fit.
A mysterious valve at the end of the three straws is thicker than the straw brush and dramatically harder to wash.
This is a little bit of a shock because I've never had any issues with StrotoType.
It's really stressful not being able to take a drink out of your body.
The good news is, it retains excellent cooling capacity.
I remember picking it out of the bag and washing it the next day, I had still about 50% of the ice left that I had put in the day before.
I don't drink hot, so I'm always going to be a straight person.
Please try to improve the next model.
The first review (with a photo)
This is the first time I've ever seen a review.
This is the opinion of the amateur who has no knowledge, who has only bought a doll for the first time and put on a doll eye for the first time.
I am quite content with the light in the obitdoor, which is so lovely.
However, you cannot install the gate if the force is not put in a little harder.
I think this is different, but I put a pin in the hole of the doll's eye.
As for delivery, we had been waiting for three weeks, but it arrived faster than expected in eight days (Narita Airport is nearby).
But I was worried because the e-mail was never sent.
So, if you look at the Amazon shipping listing we saw earlier, it shows that it's still shipping.
And the whole idea is that there was no air in the eyes, the damage, and a lot of bits and pieces in a little sealed bag in the back of the envelope, and that's pretty reassuring.
So, if the phone number was printed on the envelope, then, could I get an email from abroad?
So this is going to be negative 1.
The goods are in the best possible condition, I think they will buy well for that price and in this quantity.
The Doll Eye is a 8-millimeter model of the iPhone.
It's a little bit small and has a small area to work on.
I ordered it after seeing the size, and it felt about twice as small as I imagined it would be.
It is larger than the A4 size, but because the exterior is a groove for parts, the working area is narrower than A4.
I was going to use it to fix electrical things or make a glimpse, but it's kind of hard to use unless you have a B4 size.
Other tasks, such as assembling and disassembling can be handled using a separate tray or mat.
So, the problem is you can't put tools, parts, and work, all in a space the size of a magazine.
And I've also thought about ordering another one to double the size, but I think that it's a little bit harder to keep using it because of the fact that there's so much electrical interference and all the bits that you've cut are going to get absorbed.
The fatal defect.
After trying to open the lid of the battery box, she used a rubber slip sheet to open the lid, but if she tried to fill it and close it, it would not close.
I'm out at this point.
Highly recommended!
Does the battery box cover close?
Adding to that, instead of a seal on the product, there was a small, fluffy satin wrap.
Is this a used item?
It's in English, written on a small piece of paper.
You can't read the diagram, and you don't know how to operate it.
Maybe the other finger...
I found a good product!
I bought it immediately.
I used to wear a lot of them to make my pink ring, and I was so... a little messy.
But I think it's good for the other fingers.
But I think he's a good idea trader.
That's the price.
You don't need to be looking for quality in this kind of product.
One flower mark was broken.
The size is just about the right size.
People with thick earlobes might be tough.
Maybe I should have bought a handle.
Whoa.
The design is great, but it's big in your hand, so why do you think it doesn't work better on your feet?
It's winter in the middle of the east...
As in other reviews, the electrical wiring is only 110 x 80 square feet and the arrangement is horizontal instead of vertical.
I bought it because I wanted to warm the whole canopy, but it was bigger and more expensive than the mat type, so I can not check it in the shop like a famous manufacturer, so I could not do.
It can only be used in combination with a water jug and a N worm.
By the way, the quality of the blankets is beyond question.
I'm really good at this.
It's small, and it's got plenty of air.
The batteries can be replaced with backup.
And if you put it on your desk and adjust the angle, then it'll look fine just like the picture.
If you're sitting on a turtle, it blows off with its own wind, but if you set up the hook, it's fine.
Noise, if we use it for outdoor/family situations, cannot be detected in "Mid", but in the office, it is imperative not to be "small".
After all, we need our share of the donation on the way out.
And for office use, "small" is too much air, too cold.
It's perfect for the scene where you run out sweating, running to your family, cooling off in a big hurry.
But when you throw it in the jar, it rarely comes around without the power button being pressed.
So you'd be able to do things like push a button a little bit or push it a little bit and then push it longer.
Because they're essential in times of deadly extreme heat, we can help you make something better.
Multi-purpose light speaker
I use it as the weakest of the warm colours and I use it in the bedroom.
It's better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
Lighting is a touch-based feature, you can adjust the brightness and color.
White collars can fit in any room, and the color lighting changes with the gradient.
And, also, if you touch the color that you like, it will stop with your favorite color, so you can light it up to your mood!
It's LED, so you can expect it to last a long time.
For the sound quality, I think this is just too good for my amateur ears.
And the great thing about these lights is that they're multi-functional, anyway.
It's got a big speaker at the top.
You can pair it to Bluetooth with your cell phone and the like and you can enjoy your music wirelessly.
If you pair it with your cell phone, you can also call hands-free.
It's also compatible with MicroSD and can be linked to your computer and play your music as an MP3 player.
Percussion and piano practice.
At the age of 66, he started the DTM for preventing gout.
I bought the audio interface and the original equipment.
I started out as a drummer, but I've become obsessed with playing the piano, and I'm very, very devoted to practicing every day.
So I downloaded the source, which I've included in the package, but the protection didn't work, so I started downloading the ASIO, but the free source sounded good, so I use it for my piano practice.
I'm glad I bought it.
I feel deceived by appearances.
Is that a special product?
It's going to be a long sentence.
After 4 or 5 years, the synthetic leather of the dashisha office chair (jumping armrest) deteriorated and became bulky, so he considered buying a chair with jump armrest made of non-synthetic leather.
I looked through the home centers and furniture stores, but nothing was available.
Fearing that I would not get the real thing, I made a compromise between the look and the price of the design and I bought the item on Amazon.
The box is surprisingly light and compact.
The reindeer have one spare.
Beware, the hexagonal brush and scissors attached to the brushes are lubricated with oil.
The first time, they did not realize that the oil had been applied to the hexagonal lens, but they became frightened, for the oil was on the whole body.
40 minutes to assemble.
Completion of the goods.
The upside-down armrests are not rigidly positioned on the left and right side of the armrest. The left armrest is heavy for up and down, and the right armrest is light. The use of the armrests is not good (there is no adjustment method).
The angular adjustment of the mobile headrests has weak grip and hang down quickly with the "kick" sound.
The seat is made of non-renewable high-density urethane form which makes it hard, uncomfortable to sit on.
Back-up competitive mesh is stiff compared to other mesh chairs, and is painful in the back.
The height from the seat to the ground was 530, not 550 (... seat height is important for height) and the caster supports are not made of steel, leaving the durability questionable.
I use a special cushion and the part of the mesh that will soon decay (wounds) so I use a towel.
At 186 cm and 80 kg, the only thing I feel good about is the fit in my back, but apart from that, I also feel it is a lowly, out of touch, and an unsatisfactory product.
After all, an office chair might be better bought sitting down to look at an artifact.
I got an Amazon greeting email from the manufacturer to ask them about armrests and headrests?
We're working on it.
Well, it looks something like this.
But I didn't expect a little too much of it, because I couldn't live in a comfortable environment, and I was going to be seeing a BS4K right-aligned, so I bought a cheaper 4K tuner from Pixel.
As an experiment, free right turn broadcasts were watched, starting with NHK BS4K, and can be enjoyed nicely on a Panasonic 4K TV bought at the same time.
(The image clicks sometimes) The update came as soon as the purchase, and the recording enabled, so I was looking at some of the pre-booked recordings, but would the 2.5-inch HDD also have an impact, where the image would stop playing and frame overflows would occur.
And there's also no really compliments for the user interface, and the message is "You can watch 4K broadcast".
By the way, during the recording, it can only be followed by the replay of the recorded program, and we accept this as a plus feature that you can record in 4K with the HDD.
Expect too much of your product and you may be disappointed, so don't expect too much.
I hope this will be improved with the update.
The heating system is fine.
I put two 500-millimeter PET bottles in, and it was warm for about two hours, and it felt very hot for two and a half hours.
We used to use it for the seat in the back seat of a compact car, but the fan sound is so annoying when you're idling, you don't feel it during the ride.
And I was concerned about the smell, which is like new or chemical, of the fans, and we had to open the windows and ventilate regularly.
Other reviewers wrote that the bar of the part that passed through the shoulder strap is not so bad that you have to break the bar with a minus driver or something.
It's really fragile.
Today, two months after using it, it suddenly broke.
I like the key sense and the size, but it doesn't make sense that it's broken.
And I'm on a computer all day working on video, and all of the volume is 100% on my own.
We can turn it off and it'll be back to 100% in an instant.
The earphones are so loud, you can't hear anything, and I can't use the computer at night.
The sound indicator seems to send a signal every few seconds, going on and off on the computer screen.
And also the keyboard interferes with the mouse, so if you don't turn off every keyboard, you can't use the mouse.
The enter key and the backspace key are no longer responding.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it costs 1000 yen, you can buy it to try it out.
If we're lucky, we should be good for six months.
Compared to other companies in the same price range, a one or three-year guarantee is a six-month guarantee.
The short warranty period means that they're fragile.
It's the best stuff, the worst packaging.
The products have different colors, and I love them.
If you're looking for a food-staker, I highly recommend it!
However, there was no delivery note and the big cardboard boxes had no delivery note, and the packaging was terrible.
The lid was uncovered when I opened the box.
I recommend the product, but it might be better to buy it somewhere else.
I'm worried about the intensity.
I bought the cover, but couldn't afford it because I had to replace it.
It plays a part in the stability of the lid, but it's a very expensive plastic, so if you don't open and close the lid and you're not careful, it will make a nasty sound like'm-h-m-h-m-h, [break].'
Since you have to choose what fits the thickness of the cover, you need to be careful when buying.
The meatballs are cute.
I had my dog, and I was looking for a backpack for a trip, and a grey backpack appealed to me and I offered to buy it.
It was made of wood, it was a folding box, and it was so light, and it didn't feel as heavy.
The fasteners move smoothly, and there's no snag.
It is easier to travel for a long time.
It's very compact, and it's easy to fold.
But you can fold it, you can see the meatball design, and if you put it there, it's pretty.
Light and comfortable!
They're so comfortable on the sleigh and the curl.
First of all, I bought it for its appearance and cheap price.
TSA lock has been my favorite for years, and there are a couple more of them, but they're useful.
And for those celebs who have lost their keys or have lost them, we recommend the number lock.
However, to be honest, I would say that the most important thing to me is that it's lightweight, but if you want to get strong and secure, the fastener is a piece of fabric that sticks around for weeks, so if you cut it with a knife, it breaks in an instant.
Also, because the fasteners are sweet to the touch, I want the work to overlap.
It is advisable to bring it on board if you are abroad.
Anyway, I went for a trip on the Shinkansen, but it was comfortable.
It's hard to pick a size...
We find it hard to buy shoes because of the wide width.
I am wearing a conveyor belt and a 24-centimeter waistband.
MRL996 is also 24 cm.
I thought it would be difficult at first, but I got used to it.
This time the ML574 was indeed a little difficult when my sister told me that it was 24.5 cm thick.
It was like a thumb.
That's why I bought 25 cm.
When I opened it, it was huge...
If you're wearing socks, they're a little loose.
I was hesitant to return it, but if it gets tough at 24.5 it will be a hassle. I will just put it in the 25 and wear it.
I bought Team Red, but it's so good in bright red!
There's a lot of black and white monotone clothing, so wear this, it'll make it bright!
165 cm, male in his 40s.
I ordered the appropriate size L, but if it looks similar to the following specs, I recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm. Weight: 60 kg. Waist: 81 cm. Weight and girth: 100 cm.
In the water, your waist is relaxed, and your rush guard goes up.
They're still in the water, fixing the raised portion.
If you're in a hot tub, you can see your stomach.
And then, you know, you go up and down, you're moving up and down, but then you're going up and down.
The raw material is strong, and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples coming through.
At this price, I am satisfied with this build, but I think it would fit better to buy a smaller one.
We got a gas leak, but...
Silver Colt 25 still had a gas leak, and after changing a valve, I still had problems with missing parts of the tank but after using [Base Bond Q] to seal the tank and make the repair glissi is fun. You want to buy this Colt 25, it is necessary to have a person who can disassemble or who can take digital camera, not being able to take apart it, not a lot of people who are unsure recommend it, but even if it is broken, it might be fun, I already bought a black Colt 25, disassemble tool is to take out the left side without touching the trigger with the thumb of the left hand and the parts do not fly and disassemble himself, and when assembling, when sprinkle and fine parts can be painted with glycosylglycol and fixed with the grid assembled and when disassembled, first to go through the grip, then remove the safety net and remove the safety so as not to break the body and the outer end of the diesel tank and then take a pen to the front so that the motor is not damaged.
188 yen, I thought, what quality?
They can use a quick turn and a torque.
It has to be light, small, and simple.
And there's no trouble putting the bits in, and I thought, well, this is an incredible, amazing $1,680.
And what about the durability?
It may not be used very often, but I think it should be in the toolbox.
I got this from a company I knew, 1/4 inch hexagonal shank magnetic quick release driver, rotor bit holder 60/100/150 mm.
I did not have any problems, or rather, it was pretty good for the price.
The controller will not work.
So the machine will not be able to operate on its own.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the device is immediately moved in the wrong direction and cannot be controlled.
It is better not to buy this product.
I have to warn you.
This is a terrible product.
And the cord, but I would recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It's reliable, it's been around for a long time, and it hasn't broken yet.
It can also be used for PC games.
(Laughter) I was very happy to receive a refund for my Amazon gift voucher, because I was able to get a return on damaged goods within a month.
Is this gonna increase my computing power?
I think the positive aspect of this is that you understand calculus.
We have to be a kid who can do math to some degree.
The problem is difficult to solve.
And also, when you give the tool to your friend -- you're supposed to move it up on the screen, but I've tried to do it myself, and it never works, and it never works.
For those who are familiar with DS it might be easy to get the game started?
I don't know, I never really got used to the images of the cartoon characters, you know, the DS, because some of the fun of the screen -- I'm not familiar with that.
They do it in a way that makes you think about time, like how many questions are right in a period of a few minutes.
Now, I know you like to rush your exams, but... why not be in a hurry and make the calculation?
And I don't like the sound of the gong at the end.
And even though we are working so hard, why can't we make it sound more comfortable?
Now I feel like 6200 yen is a waste of money.
That is half the price.
I'm sorry, but there are still two of them.
I like the stuff about Persona.
Persona 3 has reached the ED.
5 played all the way through.
Persona 4 has been reconstructed in Vita.
What he can do is the same as in Persona 4.
I don't have a story, and it's shorter than the first one.
It's a really cool song!
Just listening to it makes me feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were first in HD, so the first time I saw them I was impressed.
And so it's pretty nice. (Laughter) So because Persona 5 is nice and clean and it's fresh, I can say that Person 5 is a bit more like three.
As a voice geek, I felt three is more fun than five.
Person Three was in the blue, but the background was hard to see in the dark.
5 is the main bright color, red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if it is covered with background.
But since it has a lot of assistive features, I think even the most tone-deaf can play it.
If they turn on the challenge feature, this can be a very dangerous game.
The triple-pack has a santra, but not quite so well made, so it's a complete set of four, so if you like the songs of Persona, I recommend this one.
That's too bad.
I liked the color of the photo type, and I bought it, but the real one is bluish but it's closer to black or chocolate gray.
And it wasn't a double-back.
So you've been thinking about buying gold, but, for now, we're just holding off because it's cheap.
Follow-Up: After the review, I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange it with new products.
The process was very fast.
I think the response was very good despite the cheap goods.
I bought four stars, and then I bought gold.
I think the colors are beautiful, almost as in the picture.
But the buckle is not a double lock and it's obviously different from the picture.
That's the only regret.
The evening is very heavy.
I used the SIM-free iPhone 7s.
At the first setup, because I didn't know how to point out SIM after arriving in Korea, I asked the woman at the SK counter at the Kinpo airport to tell me ((Setup> Mobile Communications> Communication Option to ON data roaming)) and it worked.
So the narration that came with the products had very little to do with the...?
However, the radio waves around the airport in Kimpu are bad. I have been using 3G all the time.
It's 4G in the city.
Sometimes, the communication was very heavy in the evenings and evenings, but now we can think about how we were reaching hundreds and hundreds of megabytes a day.
It's better than I thought.
I had the Softbank Z4 for two years, I got it SIM-free on Ymobile, and the Z4 had run off, so I was looking for a used Xperia, and I found this phone. It works with a brand new cell phone.
So I used a mobile Suica, and I was worried about whether it would work, but there was no problem at all.
I've bought the size, the weight, and silver, and I think it looks like an iPhone 6?
In fact, it's not GAME, but it also has the same processing speed and it's a little bit faster than the Z4, so the review said fingerprint recognition is slightly slow. But, actually it's a little bit of a long process to get to it, so it's faster to get to it, and we're using it here.
I made the iPhone, and I thought it was great, and I made Android Version 9, and then I was able to make a satisfying purchase.
The thing is, I'll try it with a little bit smaller, with no strap holes, with strap holes, no testing with water-resistant cases, it's a little bit heavier, I have only been using it for a couple of months, but I'm happy with it.
