Diego Cocca becomes Mexico's new coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. Until a few days ago, the 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused trouble at the club.
Geesthacht: New bedding signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blooms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colours white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blooms" is the name of a campaign by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted since 2015. Goal: In the Geesthacht urban area, flowering hins are to be created over a wide area, on which insects can find food at any time. "If the weather is favourable, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the undertaking does not only remain an action by conservationists and the city's environmental service, but also draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed on the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. In this way, passers-by should be able to find out what is blooming here so beautifully. The hope is that amateur gardeners will replant at home in a targeted manner.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started
More recently, shrubs such as winter honeysuckle and winter viburnum are in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the tubs on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given further signs. "The winter honeysuckle is a very broad-bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," it reads under further information, for example on the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bedding plants that are now showing flowers. In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started. It blooms particularly profusely on the Richtweg near the incline, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of them when he looks down from the sky at Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m. sharp for a brisk tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich native (January 15, 1921) from the Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tapping is my life, I can't imagine without it".
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today you would say a musical performer, worked together with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I've spent my life dancing, acting and singing."
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something of a chick in the group of tap dancers. She says: "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dance was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, each of which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French Claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, big and small, old and young are welcome".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old told BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Exercise, healthy food and no alcohol".
Analogue in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitization progresses, the desire for analogue is growing again for some
The speed with which our everyday lives became digital left us little time to set up rules for dealing with them and to adapt our communication and working methods to them, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you were one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call your relatives for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you could go to a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic headphones and the click of the coins in the vending machine are unforgettable. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What's next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president's advisers.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was hostile to pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023 there will be a proper celebration again in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn't have to wait long.
Father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side is his wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children's hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
From the depths of the sea came to Franconia the Minister of Justice, Georg Eisenreich, and his wife Anja.
Completely out of touch: Minister for Science and the Arts, Markus Blume, is drawn into space.
Ilse Aigner, president of the state parliament, sought out none other than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the master builder alias Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff in carnival: Bavaria's Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann. At his side is his wife Gerswid.
On the roller: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the Regensburg district, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missing either.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party parliamentary group leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the pleasure of the SPD parliamentary group leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It became royal with FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the chairman of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a mime. At his side is his wife Andrea.
If politics doesn't work out anymore, he can at least do magic. Nuremberg's Lord Mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and his wife Anke as Hermione.
Brisk as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small swipe at the climate activists by the Franconian Tatort detective Sebastian Fleischer, played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was not to be missed. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 world championship titles and continues to catch up with his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV pundit, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even heavy fog did not prevent perennial winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay team had already successfully defended their title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the chase race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so he can compensate for shooting mistakes to a certain extent with frightening ease.
Meanwhile, nothing came together at Doll again. After the veteran had missed all chances of a medal at the start with a penalty lap in the mixed relay and there had only been sixth place, things didn't go any better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in prone shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
Six years ago, he surprisingly won in Hochfilzen by a razor-thin margin of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career successes for Doll, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Olympic eighth in Beijing pulled away without a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Championship debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will focus on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula replied with regard to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a run-off election at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Bolsonaro's supporters had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the U.S. Capitol a good two years ago, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly invaded parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not pay much attention to international relations. "His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and night," Lula said. "Sounds familiar," Biden replied – an obvious reference to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note about the press - the Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? It showed the members of the Red Army Faction cleared for denunciation and shooting.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which already existed before Corona, public sentiment was stirred up against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more after Raudis in the S-Bahn or onanists in the park, is publishing a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is badly informed, because there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, it's about it: Ms. Wagenknecht is in 1st to 5th place (!), followed by Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone around me anymore who reads this paper. If it does, it would be high time now. We have reached the well-known level where nothing is below that.
And now, at the latest, well dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And there is no need for differentiation here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. This was confirmed by Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It states: "I can confirm that my client, through his family lawyer, has filed an application with the competent court for the annulment of his civil partnership. I don't comment on details."
Glööckler and his partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, and there had been rumors of separation for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from their shared house in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
In the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved, a memorial center was established in 1999. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended France's values, Macron said. He also contributed to the german-French peace. Among other things, the survivor had campaigned for german-French youth encounters.
A curve for 14 houses: In Homeias, everyone knows everyone
LZ-Series North Lippe hamlets: It is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof in homias. Here the inhabitants will find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles a day roar along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even back again.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes to be "absolutely" necessary in the fight against the high inflation rate. "Inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can rise again slightly, and China's opening up can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told Welt am Sonntag.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and held out the prospect of a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16 March. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher lending rates can lead to investments being postponed and thus weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more severe than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we have to keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt must not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area in the medium term with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. Although the upward trend in prices weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent higher than in the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the greatest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's (SPD) proclamation of the "German pace" in infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And it may also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will emerge that does not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals that went into operation at the turn of the year - but also not as slowly as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new "Germany pace" on the occasion. In addition, the German government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it's very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, this should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will," said Hartung. Therefore, there must still be a process of negotiation as to what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, they tried the classic set of rules and did not succeed. "We should think again about whether the previous approach was the right one. Maybe we overdid it with the rules and made it too complicated for us."
In view of the many open tasks, such as the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns of break-up of Bayer Group
The chemical trade union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the company after an announced change of boss at Bayer. "From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three pillars, is exactly right for the challenges of the future," Francesco Grioli, member of the union's Board of Management and Bayer Supervisory Board, told the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription medicines, the Consumer Health business with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism."
The background to this is the change of management at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. At the beginning of June, the ex-head of pharmaceuticals of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over.
Baumann has been criticized for a long time. The acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto, completed in 2018 for 63 billion dollars, hangs on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into the house. Bayer's stock has been in decline for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to ratify the actions of the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Pressure had been exerted by long-term strategic investors. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital have also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split of the group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the value of the company," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post". On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are opposing a government project with the concentrated protest on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform on Saturday. For the fourth time, the trade unions are mobilising against the centre-right government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, more than a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants in protests were counted. A turbulent debate in parliament has been going on for a week about the controversial reform.
Many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid in long enough for a deduction-free pension by the time they reach retirement age. In many strenuous professions, people could hardly work longer, say the opponents of the reform. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved retirement and not completely wear out their health at work.
Macron: Imminent deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an imminent deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older and older, employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics cast doubt on the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government does not only want to work on the retirement age. The increase in the required payment period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was abandoned, and even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron had already tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protest and strikes were certain for all.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, which have announced support. But some of the MEPs - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote is likely to be Macron's concern about paralyzing strikes at the moment. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sun at high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that a lot of sunshine can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Admittedly, this high will shift a little to the east over the next week. However, it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give the people in the lowlands dreary high fog gray for days, while in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges there is pure sun".
Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it can still rain a little, according to the DWD. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up during the day and the sun appears more and more frequently. In the rest of the country, it remains very cloudy or overcast with high fog. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine around 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually getting stronger, nibbles on the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more during the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere it has to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum temperatures are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine around 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, only around 3 degrees are expected. In addition, weak winds blow from different directions.
On Tuesday there may again be only tough dissipation of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be cheerful after the fog has cleared. At high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps, the sun is expected to shine all day. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominator struggles: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia
The defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia was severely disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can," the Italian said on ZDF after she had threaded a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six races in this discipline so far this season. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline. She was absent from her home race in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was a matter of hundredths of a second," said Goggia after Switzerland's Jasmine Flury's surprising victory in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave it my all. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected and ultimately missed by all experts: "But they are not".
Girl missing in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for clues about their whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the population for help in the search for a missing child. 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school on February 10, 2023 at around 12:30 p.m. together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. It was there at the S-Bahn station that she was last seen. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of the German language and local area.

Zelensky and ministers against Russia's participation in the Olympics
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
At a joint conference call, it was agreed to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation took place on the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, wrote British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer on Twitter. "And I made Britain's position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus will not be allowed to be represented at the Olympics. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue."
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Zelensky said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag is ultimately soaked in blood and unbearable.
Ukraine threatens to boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelensky called on officials to stand up for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The occasion for the conference was the IOC's announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had also reaffirmed during the consultations that it would reject the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "From our point of view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to resume the Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong way to go," a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior said in response to a dpa request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events don't happen in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided that they are clearly committed to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently declared that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.
Chalk up where it happens
"Hey, butt!", whistling after the fool in a skimpy sexy costume and shouting lewd sayings: All this falls under the term "catcalling". The term refers to nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Lost half of the vehicles? : U.S. sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
Lost half of the vehicles? U.S. sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. We are talking about "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its main battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the main stockpile of tanks" of the Russian army has been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary for international security affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Speaking at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank, Wallander did not provide further details on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to U.S. estimates.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kyiv the delivery of Challenger 2 main battle tanks for March. In a coalition with other countries, Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, in all likelihood, their delivery will take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev held out the prospect of building and modernizing thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy was begging abroad for planes, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army. This means, for example, that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Fuss about filling posts in the army
Because the post, which will be held in the future by the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM) Christian Ortner, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy, Herwig Jedlaucnik, suspects corruption of posts and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the approach.
A call for tenders is not necessary because the appointment is made to a previously vacant position, the minister said. She did not want to comment on "speculation by a liberal staff representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious accusations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these have been dispelled.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision is based on the "appearance of postenschacher," says SPÖ defense spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees in front of costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs, including for security, are also difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total cost of the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The "Parade of Merry People" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades were cancelled at the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We are going through with our event," says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claussen. But here, too, the financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors were not found or the existing ones contributed even more, reserves would have to be touched - "that doesn't happen every year". The deficit currently: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: In the case of confectionery, there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther from the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. By luck in disguise, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. For the move, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. Twice as many personnel will be needed for security as in 2020.
If you stand by the side of the road during the Shrove Monday procession in the Rhineland, you could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have so much with them. Camel or not, the rush of visitors is likely to be large: "I think that if it doesn't rain from buckets that day, then we can definitely expect an increased crowd," says Cologne train conductor Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that there has been no regular Shrove Monday parade for two years. Of course, there is no substitute for the train."
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail. However, the train is generally "deficient", that is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Home-Distilled Vodka
It is not for nothing that Ukrainians are considered hard-drinking. There is domestic beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. Not a Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't see much difference in taste. The same goes for the vodka, which is widely used. They burn it here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. Exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics, no one knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a staggering 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that as a tourist you should be careful with it. But this is only true if it goes on mass sale. There will probably also be adulteration.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Eating and drinking
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer at the end of the day, you will find great restaurants in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glow for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees victory as favourite and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal ceremony at the World Cup sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the official gallery on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range were really falling. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, referring to the clouds of fog that kept moving into the stadium, which severely impaired the view of the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Nevertheless, Steinmeier enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "I have been fascinated by biathlon since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race," he revealed, and also praised Oberhof for its modernised sports facilities: "The refurbished arena is great and offers ideal conditions. That's what the athletes say - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the World Cup was awarded." In terms of sustainability, too, the site is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades".
In terms of sport, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again outpaced the competition. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
The local ski hunters were unable to intervene in the fight for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth as the best German after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two rays of hope behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed match on Wednesday, the Black Forest native left five discs this time and disappeared into the dressing room in 55th place, deeply disappointed and without comment.
In front of 14,300 spectators, Bö had started the race with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However, in his last two standing shots he had the luck of the capable; they each landed on the edge of the discs and fell anyway. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his brother, who is five years older: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's pursuit. In the women's race, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," said sporting director Felix Bitterling, taking his "locomotive" to task. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 p.m. and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych displeases "swarm of bees" on the square
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on referee's ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "punish unsportsmanlike conduct consistently". Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Germany's top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the way people interact on the pitch. "I think that there are new behaviors of the players who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," said the 47-year-old of the German Press Agency. "We discussed that during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it."
Most recently, two coaches had also been dismissed. Mainz coach Bo Svensson was shown the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow-red. "Coaching behaviour also falls into the realm of unsportsmanship. We have noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, that the behaviour towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsportsmanlike behaviour consistently," said Brych.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and referees. "Overall, the ratio is right. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned then has to live with this. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a rethinking process as a whole were to get underway, that such behavior is simply not appropriate," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible effects at another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviour," said Fröhlich. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined athlete Oftebro wins in Schonach
After a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country skiing race, the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro secured victory ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined athletes will not compete in the Black Forest with the best line-up. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek will not be there. They are training in Oberstdorf to prepare for the World Championships, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people have been slightly injured in an accident with four vehicles on the Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a statement from the police, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist bumped into a car from behind during a slight traffic jam and pushed it onto two other cars. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
Have brought the exhibition to life: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, 12 February, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage of the exhibition "Wallbound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarters of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In each of the three exhibition rooms, two large-format murals attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over, the works of art disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created especially for the Marl Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. On the basis of numerous pictorial examples, she presents the special features of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connections to this art genre in the Federal Republic of Germany, with a focus on NRW from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate in 2013 on mural painting of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art in architecture in North Rhine-Westphalia. After the lecture, the last curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants were issued against 33 people, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing prosecutors. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have facilitated the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7-magnitude quake shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another 7.6-magnitude quake at noon. More than 7500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
Second-to-last Prime Minister of the GDR, Hans Modrow, died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the Left faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Bundestag group chairman Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left Party politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," the Left Party faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is losing "an important personality," said parliamentary group chairman Dietmar Bartsch and former parliamentary group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the elections to the People's Chamber on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded by the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière as the last prime minister of the GDR until reunification.
The chairman of the parliamentary group of the Left Party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
"Until old age, he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be lacking."
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was precisely a special merit of his. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It goes on to say:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow was "quite critical" of the new state. German reunification had been accomplished too quickly, the GDR had gone down too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow had criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened during the night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kyiv will have to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile strikes is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants were damaged, the head of the energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant had to be shut down, and production at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants was curtailed.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24, war will have been raging for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. Meanwhile, the danger from Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kyiv, an air alert was sounded for the fifth time for the day late on Friday evening. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kiev region said. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for grid company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, during the election campaign to split them off, failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, it was agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate and transfer profits.
Restructuring backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are intended to help the federal government to accompany this process. The renovation backlog on the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very unpunctual. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this grievance with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone pinch me, please?"
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann-Wick at all. She had slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", her pulse had not come down as soon as she ran in. "A race like that," and that at the home World Championships, "you can't describe it in words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, coaches and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", that's what she had planned to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. She currently occupies fifth place in the overall World Cup. And even though the women's performance density is significantly higher at the top than that of the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, there were rather others on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the U.S. government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry calls for more orders from special funds
The first armaments projects have therefore already been cancelled, and the same threatens other projects, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. However, it is not yet possible to say which investments would be eliminated in concrete terms. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a question from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the declining investment sum is rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which was approved by the Bundestag in June 2022, must bear the interest burden on the loans itself. If these increase, less money will be available for the specific purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the current high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum is declining.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway exit in the direction of Heilbronn onto the motorway. At this time, a 21-year-old VW driver drove on the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, police said. When the BMW driver turned, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. An inspection of the traffic light system did not reveal any complaints. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be hospitalized. The two cars suffered property damage totalling around 20,000 euros.
Stuttgart's Schlossplatz commemorate the victims of the earthquake disaster
On Friday evening, many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. There is a great deal of sympathy - also in Stuttgart.
The catastrophic earthquake in Turkey and Syria is occupying the world's minds. On Friday evening, more than 200 people commemorated the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had responded to the call of the Ditib Mosque community in Feuerbach, young and old, women and men. They all listened earnestly and silently to the Imam's supplication. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this catastrophe. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asked for assistance and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands with the people of Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their condolences for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration. The supplications were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind over several days in Glockenstraße, which are to be brought by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating, you shall rest or take a thousand steps".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, during the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. After all, if you don't sit in the middle of a rocky desert thanks to your home office, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, you can now use your lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At least that's the impression you could get around Lake Egglburg, where not only dog owners cavort between 12 noon and 2 p.m.
One reason, of course, could also be that modern people can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of optimal time slot use. After all, why not learn news from the settlement from the neighbor who has not been seen for a long time on the occasion of a short march through nature? Or meet your girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? It would also be possible to combine work and private life in this way - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What you can also do excellently is the purchase of natural resources. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands on a table by the side of the road along with the cheese. Or potatoes and meat. It's just stupid if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and taken appropriate precautions. For example, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and regret in their voices. "It's a pity, unfortunately we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, as you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. Which you let the sympathetic chance acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! They do have a bag with them!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which was quickly thrown on before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always puts everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat and on this midday short trip you have not only been enriched by a saddle of lamb, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due on this day - after dinner. This time, in fact, for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and came off the road in a left-hand curve to the right for an unknown reason, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a delineator, crashed sideways into a tree and stopped a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The ambulance service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of unfitness to drive, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's Tax Records: Point for the Rule of Law
The U.S. Department of Justice has decided: the tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump in 2018, then still in office as President of the United States
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to hand over the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the ministry's decision said on Friday.
Contrary to political conventions in the United States, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He defended himself all the way to the Supreme Court against a surrender. A prosecutor's office in New York has since received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless it came to a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There, the circle of authorized users is somewhat larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information repeatedly leaks out of Parliament.
The leader of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as president," Pelosi said.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract with the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, today's people rush from appointment to appointment and sometimes just shove people and hamburgers in between. In her new program, Lucy van Kuhl shows that there is something exciting about the "in-between" state.
In a humorous and thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and crisp, pointed cabaret songs, she gets to the heart of a lot - and one or the other is also between the lines. It starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30 p.m. at the Kirchheim Club Bastion.
British felon caught after long escape in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. As the British Criminal Investigation Department NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police officers in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of criminals most wanted by the NCA.
According to the authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled in early 2018 before the start of a court case in which he was sentenced in absentia to eleven years in prison for attempted import of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Encounters at the church table
Bielefeld
What is served remains a secret in advance. After all, people should come to Vespers first and foremost to meet others, not because something specific is on the menu. It starts this Sunday, when St. Mary's Church in Neustadt becomes a dining hall for two weeks.
Cabaret - Tales from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statements, loves Viennese humour, takes up the cudgels for science in his cabaret programmes. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits in with this. It remains to be seen whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic scientific skepticism. In any case, his sense of humor fits very well with Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's more recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can do - and what it cannot. Of course, there is also Corona, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many put off: What is really important? All this with a huge wink, unagitated and very ironic. And so you are not only well entertained, but can also learn something new.
Please go to the typing... it doesn't take long, doesn't hurt and can save many people's lives.
My cell phone rings with an unknown number. I suppose. This woman is the honest finder of her wallet.
The Nordcon team continues: "In contrast to our old location, we have very few stairs left.
MP Pfeiffer describes climate protection as a substitute religion. That may even be true, because I love this planet and its civilization more than any abstract god
Ten firefighters and two police officers were injured in the explosion, some seriously.
I can dismiss it all as harmless quirkiness. You don't do that to children.
It's a good thing that city politicians have been aware of the advantages for decades and never question them.
Peace and security at the turn of the times? On Monday, May 15 at 6:00 p.m., the Church of Solidarity, the Peace Plenum and the Evangelical Church of Solidarity invite you to a meeting. Stadtakademie for a lecture and discussion event in the Ev. University on the topic of "Peace and Security at the Turn of the Times?"
I really don't understand why they don't do such events on Sundays. Or not in the city.
What doesn't the #Bahn actually do to scare away customers and mess up the image even further!?
It's brilliant how well #LuisaNeubauer gets to the heart of it. We need exactly such people. Thank you Luisa!
Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard gives details and prices of monetization <URL> #DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of all stripes are travelling to Germany together (!) for the first time.
I'm curious who I'll meet there and who I'll get to know there ;-)
Party colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer eleven, as well as the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, she is also a CDU minister.
So that's really nothing new, it's the same with every electronic ticket. Checkin/checkout is a different house number.
Certainly no reason to do something about the tax evasion of 150 billion euros per year in Germany alone.
Does anyone play #wortify and found the word with all the letters today? If so, please let me know, it's driving me crazy right now.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tanker. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which offer the player temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which become increasingly difficult to hit as the game progresses. In addition, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction sequence, the game initiation sequence, the game abl on, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test procedure. The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the controls and the computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by paying attention to the text displayed in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. A hint can be, for example: OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, a dot becomes visible that represents the enemy position.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is well targeted on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMIES IN THE FIRING RANGE is displayed in the upper left hint display at the same time.
Occasionally, UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are safe missiles that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated from both the player tank and the enemy tank. A kill by the player earns him 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket and 3,000 points for a super tank. A Super Tank drives and spins twice as fast as the Player Tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the stander the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting option can be found in the figure.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum number of points in the table of maximum results, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials in the table at the end of the game. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that when a self-test is triggered, the RESET button is pressed on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or an interruption of the mains voltage, the table with the highest results is deleted. When RESET is performed, the top ten (10) scores are obtained with their initials and re-enrolled on the screen to challenge more players. Any score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank icon, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically write in dashes. After that, the device switches back to the attraction gameplay. ASSEMBLY ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI shifter. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer parts of the housing, which made this unit more stable and ensures proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever to the center position. The micro shells are now fastened with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI's X/Y game circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector generator board and the auxiliary board. With the help of this switching technology, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and steady image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players to make gaming easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Equipment Inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should do some checking to round out the quality control. In order to be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not yet connect the device to the 220 V mains. A. Inspect the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the maintenance hatch of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose plugs to each other.
NOTE: Never forcibly make plug connections. The plugs are provided with a forced guide so that a correct connection is made. A connector twisted by 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the gaming PC board for proper and tight fit. (3) Pay attention to the production number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check that the stamped production numbers match those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, knob/Audio II PC board, and TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when calling your dealer for more service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange circled opening of the fairing. If the opening is not precisely centered, the cladding, which is attached to the housing with an adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the connector and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Verify the system configuration
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. You can use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool to get an overview of your system if you're not sure if your PC meets the requirements. To enter the DirectX diagnostic program, please follow these steps: Click on the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. In the text box, type "dxdiag". Now you will see the user interface of the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card. Among other things, you can check if the graphics and sound are working properly by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D, and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Tool. Before starting the game
It may happen that other programs take up the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious to be active, and many start automatically when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. That is why we recommend that you terminate such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, find the program's icon on the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable", "Close", or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also quit general background applications as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to quit all unnecessary background applications". Clean up the system
Before you install any software, it's important to make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: use ScanDisk, Disk Defragmenter, and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Then there is a good chance that current games will run largely smoothly on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help files to learn about the ScanDisk or Error Checking, Defragmentation, and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click on the "Start" button and select the "Help" option (or "Help and Support") to access Windows Help. 2. Now, click in the Search box and enter the appropriate keyword, such as "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Checking" (Win 2000/XP), "Disk Defragmenter" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive a guide explaining how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This is often a way to prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First of all, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
The desire to create video games was sparked in me by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a whole new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression that could push the world to its limits. For me, it was an opportunity to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games were exploiting only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too focused on "action" and forgot about a fundamental element of the human experience: sensations. Meanwhile, the technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that transmits feelings. Although this could of course have been done in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised and concrete answers are offered here. Fahrenheit is proof that you can create an interactive gaming experience that isn't just about fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but has far more challenging and in-depth content. It's proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you're more skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help change your mindset. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, forcing us to question many of the principles previously considered incontrovertible. I'd be lucky if Fahrenheit - much like books, movies, and songs that have left a lasting impression on you — doesn't leave you completely unscathed either. David Cage

SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Gameplay
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with minimum credit 2) for 2 players. It is necessary to try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPAXX. The course of the game is set in such a way that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. In the event of an alarm, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, as long as you try to draw your area, your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed because you will not be able to cross your own path or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will be applied and your mark will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls work flawlessly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted on the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches - located in the device - the self-test button and the LED's on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display selects the language (English, French, Spanish, german) with which the address programming and the game work. With the help of the "Sub-Test" switch, the languages can be set. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" button to switch to the next program display. Deployment programming. This indicator can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, it can be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that may be before the start of the game. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times, the factory or default setting can be reached, when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press "Up" switch". The values are reset, the pointer (so the lines appearing green) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs in order for his own initials (names) and the hit points to be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, - if there is a coin lock - the coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for one player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be placed so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin, the credits cannot become zero if more than 99 is added. A free spins mode can be chosen by setting "Maximum Credits" to O. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": the level of the % that must be reached in order to switch to the next pass.
"Time limit": release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": Degree of difficulty of the gameplay
"Tightening tone": at "0" no sound when stationary
with "1" tone also when stationary (animated tone) "Tabletop model": with "0" floor-standing unit
at "1" tabletop device
The credits per coin are set on the "slot programming" display. High-score program display (highest hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials will appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set the high score selected on the previous display (setting "back"). Pressing the "Up" button sets the initials QIX Standard. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The "Overall Evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total Credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts all over again. The total number can only appear on 0 if the battery or the W1 connector is removed, with the device turned off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Medium coins: (not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Loans paid: Number of credits given for coins inserted (revalued). Loans granted: Number of credits given by the device. % Free Spins: Credits granted (Credits paid + credits granted per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Minutes gained: Number of minutes, if the game is extended or won. % of free time: Minutes gained/minutes played per 100. Average playing time in seconds: Minutes played/Paid + Credits granted
High Score: The number at which a player had high enough hit rates to knock other players out of the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, a standard coin setting can be selected by the display or another setting can be programmed
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons selects the programming, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is applied. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that are not suitable. Once the setting has been made, any new size to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. In case of unintentional pressing, the default setting appears. The "Up" and "Down" switches can be used to increase or decrease the values. By pressing the "Test" button, the process is finished. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") says how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" Coin Units shows the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min. coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value "0" is not used. CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This condition probably indicates failure or failure of the battery.
TROUBLESHOOTING & SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED indicator). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" button the next program is displayed. If an endurance test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test begins in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is shut down. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" indicator appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the J 19 connector is disconnected, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is error-proof, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as a banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory, which is shared between two processors, by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the memory was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: fault in the U 3, U 4 or associated circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values are inscribed to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their former value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device with the above display stops, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the connected circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined sequences of numbers in the color RAM. These numbers are checked for correctness when they are read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by inscribing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy will cause the program to stop and the LEDs will indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnosis does not show a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next check is being started (data hardware). The connection to the data processor must exist and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any recognizable seam defects. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. Had oriented myself from the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it's supposed to sit so tight and I didn't want to fight my way into an S or M with my bust size.... In the end, it would have fit in terms of length and hips... in the rest I could swim. In addition, the lining material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere. It's just a shame. It will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will certainly be worn next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I mismeasured myself and the edition doesn't quite fit. But that's my mistake. Then I slightly changed something to make it fit. The overlay looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the whole surface. Worked without any problems. Nothing slips anymore. I would buy again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for less than 1 year
The product itself is okay, but not less than a year. Since the area to chew is much too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use him because of the size. Now, at 12 months, we have picked him out again and he can use it. Hasn't been able to bite anything with his already few existing teeth. And if he was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately goes back
I was probably blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews. First of all, I would like to say that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you take with you. Due to the fact that I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. At Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for less than 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that's just not true! I was really hoping that it would be so, but there is really no question of that. The upholstered walls are much thinner and don't offer as much protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more unstable. Overall, the feel of this backpack cannot be compared to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are also not exactly of high quality. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack would go back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to spend the money on a decent backpack. Quality apparently has its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me. And it's not that the decision was difficult for me. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked is the color inside. Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is definitely a great thing, but mine is going back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
So far, I had liked the electrics series by E. L. Todd best, but my opinion has been revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. The part is about Volt and Taylor's feelings all the time and I found it unnecessarily drawn-out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admitting everything to herself and then being like a little child in every argument and grimacing?! At the same time, there were also discrepancies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor would like him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and that he heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I was hoping that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more suspense back into the story.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn! First of all: The movie is not as bad as many write. Sure, of course the story is totally constructed, and always designed according to the same scheme. When you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and knows nothing to appreciate, and does not learn! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How many times have I just thought about the movie (even though I know it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, they often bring tears to your eyes. That's why Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is really well done. It's just a shame that people just can't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and us. Out of belongings and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings :None. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise there would have been 5 stars in it. Still, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is above all "French" - it is also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Taste like quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My waist circumference has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! After that, diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has been going on for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, with the larger one full 5 ? This is very, very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint in a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfied. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like it did on the first try. Worst of all, it still stinked weeks after using it. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't go away.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance had been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only through a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
Function not quite flawless !! After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following major flaws, which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems "connecting" to the mobile phone over time. This means that it is no longer charged even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. If you remove the phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but it creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the mobile phone in the case, the cover is now so worn that it comes off the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times. These are not many major flaws, but I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly in its function and that's why, for the cost of 30€, I'm very disappointed with the product, especially because I've only been using it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews come about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get from every optician in a slightly smaller form gift. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and not better. I expected a lot more from these scarves, it's also really very, very thin. Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it, I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side, the price for these cloths is far exaggerated, more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I fell shcon in the shower), reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come off. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is rendered as bass and is not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible well enough. My old speaker didn't reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were reproduced quite naturally in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. That's why I have to deduct one star. I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
In a few places the paint was chipped and if you just walked over it with your hand, the paint went off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would only replace the damaged parts but as if both chest of drawers was damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and transferred the money back to us. A PRAISE to Amazon
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't find fault with it, as I desperately needed this product. The included adhesive hardly holds, but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which does not harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. Some of the stencils are incompletely punched out. It's ok for one-time use and as a gag for a party, but for a wedding I would invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product.
I'm not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic clasp + beautiful look + stable when it is set up + shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors slam with magnets (maybe you can compensate for it with rubber knobs) - some unclean spots
- supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no others and have them since there was no trophy in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (wrapped it with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars,  Because you have to make everything fit in order to be really satisfied. Besides, I think it's a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me.... but
... there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have given 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't run through evenly (if at all!). Also the additional plastic waste (individually packed see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full marks soon.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud at that. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall by hand. I always woke up when I turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I found the colors and also the color change beautiful, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also liked the fact that it has a battery so that the clock and the alarm time do not have to be re-entered in the event of a power failure. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light great, workmanship insufficient
I have replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - get 4" is not a good deal. I'm sure Amazon would have arranged this quickly and accommodatingly, but I didn't find out until after the return period. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two star deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly illuminated. The light color tends to go in the direction of cool white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room, etc. For living spaces, I would personally go for warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also do this and I may also get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is a help, I would be happy to receive a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes, positively. I've been thinking for a long time whether I should order this set or not. ** The material is sturdy and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to be able to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **They also do not transmit the heat and can therefore be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swiping and they're gone. Finally I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-stock sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping simply great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, unpacked the faucet and checked all the parts. We found out that the part had already been installed. We have noticed considerable scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably already been delivered and returned. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; Never again do we order such goods via Amazon, but prefer to spend a little more in the hardware store, where we get decent goods. I just think it's sad that customers are being fooled like this!!
Product itself top, outdoor sensor unfortunately broken after only 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, and there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. At the same time, the thermometer still seems to be intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of the outside humidity are always displayed. This is a pity, because the device was attached to the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with a weak grass collector
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery is still driving through the republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with the triggering of a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and it results in a nice cutting pattern. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the big drawback is the catcher. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you put it down for a short time, it will of course be compressed and parts of the contents will fall out. What is worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator shows red even when the grass collector is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Emptying the basket of a large lawn when it is only half full cannot be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate construction of the grass collector makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to save the battery. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to take out the batteries and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm if the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I still haven't been able to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high and the screw falls out at the front right, because it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The poles that hold the trolley are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do, because it's impossible to print something out that way. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables, because otherwise you have to lay them again several times, which is very strenuous. I have already written to support but after a week of waiting I still haven't received an answer. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back. Was expecting a little more.
Robust and precise I am pleasantly surprised
Unfortunately, my old caliper gave up the ghost after many years, so I had to get a new one. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full marks for it and I think it lasts at least as long as the old caliper. There is a clear buy recommendation from me and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and didn't wear it for the time being because it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it has been constantly "aired". After returning it is no longer possible, I disposed of it. Discount from purchase
Ok for the price
The stars and balls on this necklace are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I think is quite nice. However, the chain is very simple overall, so I have already torn open the clasp twice. So far I have been able to repair it again and again, but I think that it won't last long. But for the low price you simply can't expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't open, amazing! I rubbed it with a little leather care, which makes it a little softer and more cuddly. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately junk! I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now for the function: Connects only after some gimmicks.... if you follow the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, because after only an hour the connection was gone, even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all, not useful for me! The thing went back! In any case, I would advise against a purchase, it will only bring trouble!
Damage in transit
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line as well as the drain would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will do its job a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots broken. The box was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled cardboard box. I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I urgently needed the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance.
Could have been thought through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer would be more pleasant than walking around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. In the beginning, everything went quite well. However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this can also be done with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. I didn't find a suitable flat-head screwdriver that wouldn't have ruined the whole screw immediately. Now to get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can put the screw on different sizes or lengths through the different parts, but once you have screwed the whole thing together, you need pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw in the thread broke off on the third time I mounted it and thus the entire thing became unusable. Conclusion: If at all, then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at this price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the stated dimensions
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all this in featherweight. Since I don't have a comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use. First of all, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can't really imagine packing everything there, e.g. for a three-week holiday. If necessary, the really large parts can be put directly into the case - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/bags. Not high-quality workmanship, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.
So-so
So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas too. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't. Battery? Bartered. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. There were two black cables. Battery life is sufficient for a very long time. Definitely perfectly adequate sound. I liked that the headphones don't hurt even after wearing them for a long time and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Buy recommendation in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions. Price-performance ratio is fully consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the lightning deal. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn't so deep, and the sleeves could use a little more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It doesn't get any worse than that. I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually works, Blu-rays are recognized as unreliably as possible. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which Rödel makes noises that have not been heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because it doesn't work anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But then you can't press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language or anything during the film. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port facing up is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a disdainful extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So it's not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters, which I had to send back, unfortunately could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and that of the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, it doesn't fit with the adapter. Well, it also holds so safely and has contact from there... All in all, a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and sturdily manufactured in an aluminum piece. Price performance fits.
Lots of power
Top device. Has been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet, but it performs well. I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool and am therefore always on level 2. Has also fallen several times on the tiled floor and has survived well. And I also like the simple design. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The workmanship of the brush head made a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but it does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are pleasantly surprised, in live mode the location is accurate to what feels like 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters, but this is not disturbing. I would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently it lasts about 1.5 hours. A solution that would last 7-14 days would be great. There is an XL version but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, so the battery wouldn't have to last that long and we also find it impractical to change it every day. You should deal with the dog, not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education class, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the lessons. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I owned before. At first glance, there seems to be no difference, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly made and the strap on the heel is quite loose and will most likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on the off chance. The mattress and a car air pump were included in the scope of delivery. About the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I've wiped it away and hope it doesn't reappear. When inflated, a lying test was carried out directly. It's easy to lie on and fits in perfectly with the festival. Of course, this mattress can't replace your own bed, but the one for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Previously, we took out the seats in the back. Thus, it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has various adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the connector was defective (something at the solder joint). Since my boyfriend is a skilled craftsman, he was able to repair it and reassembled, the good part worked excellently and pumped up the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and also lasts a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not reappear. After the test, I can definitely recommend them. If I have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the ridiculous processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors on it and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly, because they were already coming towards him. The parts often come out of a mess, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to attach the parts. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Most of all the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach.) In itself, I would not buy this calendar anymore and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers will rethink the way they have designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7 year old daughter flies with it. Indoors, it flies very well and the 5 min. flight time is usually quite sufficient. I didn't expect hair to get stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, please contact us.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. When I bought it, I didn't see that it was not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would still be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, the computer has been constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the runtime of the battery
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and optics great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. Operation worked well.... And yet I send them back. The big catch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, only on drm cabinet overnight and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already at the end of the day / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time. Therefore, not usable for me. What a pity.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, you should definitely get a case. Most recently, I liked cases in which you can also insert your credit card. This is what the case offers here. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid stands up a bit. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a sturdy impression and seems to be well made. She looks classy. In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only at the ports there are recesses. Otherwise, you can operate the on/off switch and volume control on the sides well through the case. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. It doesn't even work on the QI charging station made of leather from TORRO. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
high-quality cover with bulletproof glass foil
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some grip. It's not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone. Overall, a good buy.
