4.1 Overview
The characters included in this document are encoded in single-byte, double-byte or four-byte.
The single-byte part includes all 128 characters from 0x00 to 0x7F in GB/T 11383-1989.
4.3 Double-byte part
The double-byte part includes all graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, CJK Unified Ideographs in GB/T 13000 and some graphic characters.
The characters in the double-byte part are according to Appendix A.
The graphics, code positions and functions of ideographic description characters should comply with Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 unifies the encoding of Chinese characters used in China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and other countries and regions.
Chinese characters with unique abstract glyphs are assigned separate code positions; Chinese characters with the same abstract glyphs from different sources are assigned shared code positions.
Encoded Chinese characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-byte part
The four-byte part includes 66 CJK Unified Ideographs in GB/T 13000 that are not included in the above-mentioned double-byte characters (9FA6-9FEF, excluding 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB), CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F and characters of minority languages that have been encoded in GB/Work 13000.

5 Overall structure
In the main text, numbers prefixed with 0x are in hexadecimal, and those without 0x are in decimal.
In the appendix, all encodings are in hexadecimal, and all other numbers are in decimal.
The single-byte part uses the encoding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using the code positions 0x00~0x7F.
The double-byte part uses two eight-bit binary bit strings to represent a character, with the first byte code positions from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the second byte code positions are 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte part uses the unused 0x30 to 0x39 in GB/Work 11383-1989 as the suffix for expanding the double-byte encoding, with the encoding range from 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39.
The encoding range of the first byte of the four-byte character is 0x81 to 0xFE; the second byte is 0x30 to 0x39; the third byte is 0x81 to 0xFE; the fourth byte is 0x30 to 0x39. That is: 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; 0x81318230 to 0x81318239 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.

DESCRIPTION: C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The suffix of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default settings:
gcc considers preprocessed files (.i) to be c files and sets c-style links,
g++ considers preprocessed files (.i) to be c++ files and sets c++ style links.
The suffix of the source file indicates the type of language and subsequent operations:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i Preprocessed c file; compilation, assembly
.ii Preprocessed c++ file; compilation, assembly
.s Assembly language source program; assembly
Assembly language source program; preprocessing, assembly
.h Preprocessor file; usually does not appear on the command line. Other suffix files are passed to the linker. Usually includes:
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), linking is always the last step.
During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, unrecognizable file names (including specified .o H tag files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order of the command line.
Options must be given separately: de ' is completely different from `-d -r '.
Most ` -=E : and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno- name).
Only non-default option formats are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly specify the language of the following input file as language (instead of the default selection obtained from the file name suffix).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is encountered. The optional language
Turn off any explicit explanation of the language, so process the files after the file name suffix based on RE AS E `-x' option).
If you only operate part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking), you can use the `-x' option (or file name suffix Ah) to tell geo where to start, and use the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that some option combinations (such as `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces the source file name suffix with `.o' and `.ec' tag file name. You can use the -o option to choose another name. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option -S F What's the matter.
The target file is ready.
Stop after compilation, do not assemble.
Use pipes instead of temporary files between different stages of the compilation process, because those system assemblers cannot read data from pipes, GNU assemblers do not have this problem, assemblers can accept C "dialect": support ANSI standard C programs.
This will turn off some features in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as keywords such as unix and vax that indicate rare use of ANSI trigraph features, and despite the use of (note: all standard libraries are available in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, typical examples are almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding freestanding environment does not have standard libraries, the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website)
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', handle it in C style --- that is, do not specify the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameters are empty.
The section list is deleted from here in an attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual, we have deleted the details, so when the content is outdated, people will not HERI.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing assignment to this.
He and the `-Ethis-is-variable' option have the same effect.
-traditional-cpp tries to support some aspects of traditional Cc preprocessor.
Especially the content mentioned above about the preprocessor, but does not include other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of `$' characters in identifiers (only for C++).
You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of `$' symbols.
(GNU C++ allows `$' symbols by default on some target systems, but not all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from ant type to enumeration type (only for c++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code for template declarations (only for c++), by generating only one copy at the place where they are defined for each template function.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files using templates.
When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instances are of external type. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved through typedef, which refers to each required instance.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-external-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except constructors and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to be of different types.
The value of such an expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows assignment to this (only for c++).
After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into c++, the assignable `this' seems outdated.
Therefore, by default, assigning to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation valid through the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
Various machines have their own default char types. It could be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char when depending on the sign of the data.
But many programs have been written to use just char, and they expect it to be a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine for writing the program).
This option, and its opposite, make such programs work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If no `signed' or "unsigned' modifier is explicitly declared, these options are used to define signed bitfields or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bitfields are signed, because they inherit from basic integer types, such as int, which are signed. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in the writable data segment, without special treatment.
This is for compatibility with some old programs, they think changing string constants is a very bad idea, the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The Impact of COVID-19 on the Drug Market
Its impact may be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, this disease has overwhelmed healthcare services, bringing them to the brink of collapse, and the restrictive measures implemented by governments have caused serious disruption in the global economy.
The impact of this pandemic on the drug market is still unclear and difficult to predict, but it could be profound.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit the acquisition of precursors and basic chemicals.
Traffickers, unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but some lessons can still be learned from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances, and the pattern of use shifted towards injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments around the world cut budgets related to drugs.
If governments respond to the current economic recession in the same way, interventions to prevent drug use and related risky behaviors, as well as drug treatment services, may take a heavy hit.
In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may decrease, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Some countries have a large amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and these countries are expected to be most directly affected by drug trafficking activities.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger transport almost everywhere, activities supplying drugs through commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, trafficking activities using the dark web and cargo mail may increase.
In the long run, economic recession and related lockdown measures may disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment rates and lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable are more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug-related diseases, and turn to illegal activities related to drugs - whether production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation, provide services to vulnerable populations, and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.
As government response capabilities decrease, these changes may quickly take root and become the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market Growth
Population growth patterns partly explain market expansion
Drug use is increasing worldwide, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of the world's population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, it was estimated that there were 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
Over the past twenty years, the growth rate of drug use in developing countries has far outpaced that in developed countries.
This to some extent reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Teenagers and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while in developed countries it decreased by 10%.
Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug market
Whether in developed or developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.
Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas - currently more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where the trend towards urbanization is more pronounced.
Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest. Globally, drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs like cocaine are more firmly linked to wealthier regions of the world.
Similarly, within countries, drug prevalence rates are higher among the affluent social classes.
However, those with lower socioeconomic status have a higher rate of transition to drug-related diseases.
Data from a few countries suggest that harmful drug use patterns and diseases are associated with low income.
These patterns seem less common in wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have always been associated with an increase in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide to lose their jobs.
COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation, either because of reduced control by national authorities or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of economic crisis.
The COVID-19 related restrictions have led to a reduction in air and land transport, and sea trafficking may have increased as a result, with lower interception risks at sea and larger quantities than air or land smuggling.
There have been recent reports of cocaine shipments being sent directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity Enhanced
The occurrence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but new types of potentially harmful opiates are increasing, making the drug market increasingly complex.
In addition to plant substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.
Member countries have about 500 new active substances on their domestic markets each year.
Most of them are currently stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opiates.
Although the total number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
In the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, new psychoactive opiates accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this number had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive opiates are fentanyl analogs, whose efficacy and harm have been proven, causing overdose deaths in North America and other regions, but to a lesser extent.
In North America, some fentanyl is used as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and some is used to manufacture counterfeit medicinal opiates.
Some evidence suggests that there is also a phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive substance stimulants in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce stimulant effects.
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched in vulnerable groups
A single type of new psychoactive substance has almost never formed a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
22 countries have reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals forces drug manufacturers to innovate. Many chemicals used as precursors to synthesize amphetamines, methamphetamines, and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers are always looking for alternatives, not only substances with looser controls, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade control, the so-called "specially designed precursors".
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: according to reports, in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia prompted a rise in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation seems to have changed from 2008 to 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by the Russian Federation authorities has dropped by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opiate use has significantly decreased.
But the stimulant market seems to be thriving.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methoxymethcathinone and a-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now ubiquitous in the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities report that the number of secret processing points for the production of various illegal drugs has surged, more than doubling in two years, increasing to 152 processing points in 2018.
Methamphetamine market growth in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison, and other institutional staff had already revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to "phenethylamine" and tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that cannabis was harder to obtain than "phenethylamine" or methamphetamine.
Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered multiple methamphetamine processing points, and the Bureau of Narcotics has expressed concern about the large imports of pseudoephedrine preparations - methamphetamine processing points use these preparations as precursors.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production seems to have started in 2014.
Since then, the amount of methamphetamine seized has been steadily increasing.
But the amount seized in the first half of 2019 - 657 kilograms - was a sharp increase compared to the previous year.
Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan in other countries also indicate that the country's production is rapidly increasing.
Policy Changes and Trends
Most jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis is legalized have seen an increase in cannabis use.
Canada, Uruguay, and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis has not been legalized.
In Colorado and Washington, the first two states in the United States to pass legislation, adult non-medical use of cannabis has increased, especially in the past month and daily or almost daily use, which has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that since 2011, cannabis use in Uruguay has increased, with last month's use almost doubling.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is frequent and regular use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also shows that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is the reason behind the global plunge in cannabis seizures the legalization of cannabis?
In 2018, global cannabis seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a 84% decrease in North America over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world during the same period almost doubled. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect, but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances.
Countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use.
In some other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation.
Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets. Opioids for pain management and palliative care are mainly provided in high-income countries, with uneven distribution across regions.
In 2018, over 90% of all medically available opioids were in high-income countries.
About 50% in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but consumes less than 10% of medically available opioids.
Barriers to accessing opioids for medical use are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of drug addiction. In 2018, about 35.6 million people had drug addiction.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where individuals' adverse socioeconomic trajectories - not just their status at a given point in time - are associated with the risk of drug addiction.
Drug addiction can also exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, diverse sexual orientation groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug addiction, or encounter problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the loss of healthy life years due to disability and premature death, the harmful effects of drug use on a wider social impact have increased over the past 10 years.
From 2007 to 2018, the global Disability Adjusted Life Years attributed to drug use increased by 17%.
The increase in Disability Adjusted Life Years associated with liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, was particularly high - up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited global data suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
However, in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs.
Although drug use can lead to crime, in some cases, this link can be partly attributed to various mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is already a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can potentially be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the presence and degree of violence depend less on the amount of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.
Latest Trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, with opioids posing the greatest harm.
It is estimated that in 2018, 192 million people used marijuana, making it the most widely used drug globally.
In contrast, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the associated harms of opioid drugs are often overlooked due to fewer users.
Of the estimated 167,000 drug-related deaths in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug use, 50% were caused by these substances.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Tramadol; in North America, it is Fentanyl. These two regions have little in common in terms of economy, demographic data, or general drug use patterns, but both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada has also reported similar results, albeit with lower numbers.
Part of the reason for fentanyl-related overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of Tramadol has seen significant growth.
In this region, there are an increasing number of patients with Tramadol use disorders receiving treatment.
In 2017, the global seizure of Tramadol significantly increased, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.
However, in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate Tramadol, the global seizure volume dropped to 32 tons.
The crises in these two places are driven by simple manufacturing and low production costs, as well as a lack of international regulation for Tramadol and many fentanyl-like substances or their precursors.
The crises in these two places are exacerbated by the fact that these substances are supplied in both the legal and illegal markets, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.
Stimulant use is on the rise
The stimulant field is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are seeing increased use in their main markets.
In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, about 27 million people used amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, and sometimes both increase and decrease to meet the same market demand.
COVID-19 increases the risk for injecting drug users
It is estimated that in 2018, about 11.3 million people injected drugs, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.
Over 1 million injecting drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million have hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most injecting drug users with hepatitis C have not yet been treated.
The shortage of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently, more harmful methods of use may emerge.

EU Summit Argues Over Refugee Policy, EU Official: Bottlenecks at Every Step of the Reception Process - China News Network
EU Summit endlessly argues over refugee policy, EU official: there are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process
[Global Times special correspondent in Belgium, Niu Ruifei] According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, stated that EU leaders agreed to implement stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The report said that this move by the EU is a response to the growing concern about the problem of illegal immigration in Europe. Now, the core issue for the EU is that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported.
According to summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds" to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and its member states are endlessly arguing over issues such as the payment of fence costs.
Von der Leyen repeatedly stated that EU funds will not pay for related costs.
But some member states' diplomats said that if the EU could share part of the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
The European Euractiv website stated that EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process. Limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries. The EU's refugee reception system is in a near "permanent crisis".
According to estimates by the European Commission, the EU's Schengen countries received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.
At the same time, the EU recorded over 330,000 illegal entries last year.
Against this backdrop, the summit also reached an agreement on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants based on the court decision of another member state.
In addition, the report said that EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of safe countries", which will pave the way for the EU to formulate a common list.

"US Escalates 'Chip War', Severely Damaging Global Semiconductor Industry - China News Network
Recently, the US has shown signs of escalating its "chip war" against China - first, under pressure from the US, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then, foreign media reported that the US government is considering severing all ties between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order restricting US investment in sensitive Chinese tech industries... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US has been relentless in its efforts to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the US has never ceased its efforts to suppress China's "core" development, precisely suppressing the supply chain of China's semiconductor industry on one hand, and building a "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain alliance on the other, aiming to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it's wooing South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or establishing a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, China, or establishing a semiconductor industry chain "small circle" through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework", the US is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the US by introducing politicized, camp-based, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, thereby making up for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintaining its advantageous position in the global chip industry.
However, the US's high-profile "core tactics" against China are also "hurting the enemy a thousand, self-harming eight hundred".
Recently, the well-known US chip manufacturing equipment supplier Panlin Group announced that due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography machine giant, ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.
According to US media analysis, after the US government brutally suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have been deeply affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.
The so-called US suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has long been formed.
According to professional estimates, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross national borders more than 70 times, reaching 100 days in total.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially advanced process technology, and heavily relies on East Asia.
Even if the US strongly guides the advanced chip supply chain towards regional development dominated by the US "small circle", the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are hard to change.
The US's strong "reshaping" of the "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain has severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the US has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introduced the "Innovation and Competition Act", the "2022 US Competition Act", and the "Chip and Science Act", using technological hegemony to consolidate its own technological leading advantage; it has "carrot and stick" approach towards allies, enticing chip manufacturing companies such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the US, striving to ensure the US's global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the US has indeed caused trouble for China's chip industry and related industrial development, reaping real benefits.
But in the long run, the US's hysterical suppression has forced China's chip industry to continuously break through, causing it to lose the huge Chinese market, and will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of US tech companies, damaging the development of the global chip industry.

First Batch of Personal Pension Wealth Management Products on Sale, Minimum Holding Period Can Be Only 360 Days - China News Network
First batch of personal pension wealth management products on sale
Seven products from home institutions are available, with the shortest holding period being only 360 days
Personal pension wealth management products are finally online.
On February 10, China Wealth Management Network released the first batch of personal pension wealth management products, and seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, ABC Wealth Management, and China Post Wealth Management officially went on sale.
So far, the "shelf" of personal pension accounts has finally gathered four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
It is reported that the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all public net value open-ended products, including 5 new products and 2 existing products. Except for one mixed product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income products.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters saw that among the 5 new products, 4 are from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which are fixed income products, with the shortest holding periods of 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, respectively. The corresponding performance comparison benchmarks (annualized) are 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, 5.25% - 5.75%.
The remaining new product is "Postal Bank Wealth Addition·Hongjin with a minimum holding period of 1095 days No. 1", which is also a fixed income product, started fundraising on February 10, and ended fundraising on February 19, with a risk level of two.
Among the two existing products, one is ABC Wealth Management's "ABC Tongxin·Lingdong" 360-day technology innovation RMB wealth management product, which is of mixed nature and has a risk level of three.
The other existing product is "Postal Bank Wealth Addition·Hongjin with a minimum holding period of 365 days No. 1", a fixed income type, which started fundraising on December 30 last year, officially operated on January 4 this year, and the accumulated net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the State Council Office on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions", the funds in personal pension fund accounts can invest in financial products including bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and public funds.
The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the CBIRC formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
The "Measures" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products and other personal pension products through personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice, clarifying that the personal pension system was implemented in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Shijiazhuang, Xiong'an New Area, Shanxi Jincheng and other 36 pilot cities and regions.
By the end of 2022, the number of participants in personal pensions was 19.54 million, the number of payers was 6.13 million, and the total payment amount was 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only launched three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public funds.
Now, after the personal pension wealth management products are gathered, how should investors choose?
Experts from BOCOM Wealth Management Product Development Department said that compared with other personal pension products, the pilot stage pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products have three characteristics.
The first is stability, with a more robust risk management mechanism, more stable investment strategies and concepts, and the implementation of independent custody by non-parent third parties.
The second is long-term, the term of the pension wealth management products in the pilot stage is all 5 years and above, the next step is to issue personal pension wealth management products, the shortest holding period is in principle 1 year, encouraging holding for more than 3 years.
The third is inclusiveness, the product purchase threshold is low, the starting point is generally 1 yuan, some are as low as 0.01 yuan, and the rates of custody fees, management fees and other fees are more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long term, high interest rate, and high safety, and are suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risk and can accept stable returns; while personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not guarantee principal or income, have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are higher, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

Fitness Industry Should Overcome Trust Crisis - China News Network
Another large gym "explodes"?
Recently, the issue of member rights protection in Zhongjian Fitness, a well-known fitness organization, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the organization's bankruptcy and absconding caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the organization responded, promising to strive to protect the legal rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was calmed.
Some fitness organizations have operational problems in some of their stores, temporarily closed, consumers could have calmly waited for the problem to be solved, why was the first reaction of many members "something is wrong"?
Behind the storm of fitness club member rights protection is the deep-seated issue of industry trust crisis.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepayment model, and "earning money from users who don't come" is the underlying logic of their development.
By pre-selling membership cards to obtain cash flow, constantly opening new stores, it seems to be able to cycle, but in fact, it is robbing Peter to pay Paul, unable to form a stable profit model.
Negative industry information such as gym absconding is frequently reported, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the market perspective, gyms are certainly a good business with "money prospects".
Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always attracted capital attention.
Multiple data show that the heat in areas such as cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, and the market continues to recover.
Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the deepening of the concept of healthy living, there is much to be done in the development of the fitness industry.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some organizations are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, just out of the crisis, and blow the horn of opening up new territories, and invest all the financing funds in the construction of new stores.
Admittedly, affected by the epidemic in recent years, many organizations have withdrawn, the industry has reshuffled, and powerful companies choose to increase their acquisition efforts and re-layout selectively, which is not a new opportunity.
However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a stable and long-term path, the industry must change the traditional model and change the business strategy.
Only by being steady and steady, and re-establishing consumer trust and security, can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared with building new stores to seize the market, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to calm down and optimize services, and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, we must rely on services to retain users.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to "user orientation", to focus on user needs, and to focus on service quality upgrade.
Secondly, we must rely on digital transformation to enhance user experience.
For example, the currently popular Internet gym model, which allows users to pay per use and choose their own venue.
At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively used, and social needs can also be met, achieving a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without personal trainer sales, no huge annual cards, users' worries about fitness organizations "running away" have been reduced, and trust has also increased.
In addition, we must actively explore diversified formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from single service to scene consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entrance for consumption. Sports supplements and fitness equipment needed for fitness and other peripheral products may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

"Price Difference Compensation" Reappears in Nanjing Real Estate Market - China News Network
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangzi Evening News/Zi Niu News reporter discovered in an interview on the 10th that the "price guarantee agreement" that has not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A real estate project located in the Jiangbei New District claims "price difference compensation". If the discounts of other properties before the delivery are greater than the previous discounts, the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are not a few conditions for the "price guarantee agreement"
This real estate project located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. Mr. Sun, a house viewer, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the real estate project last weekend.
The picture he sent to the reporter shows that the developer of the project promises that for those who purchase properties between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the purchase and sale contract to the delivery of the corresponding property, if the discount of other properties in the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous purchase (limited to other unsold commercial properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type), the developer can change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the property consultant said that this is actually a "price guarantee agreement", the purpose is to let buyers feel at ease, not to worry about the developer's price reduction promotion, "Now I'm afraid that it will reduce the price after I buy it, I don't have time to make a fuss at the sales office, and it's really upsetting if I don't make a fuss."
Many homebuyers believe that although the "price guarantee agreement" is to give homebuyers a "reassurance pill", the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a just-needed house in Jiangbei, said that the price-guaranteed properties must first be of the same type, and must be in the same building and the same unit. The properties that buyers can compare are few, so the "threshold" is quite high.
Some homebuyers believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that additional concessions will be given during sales, and it is not easy for buyers to "defend their rights".
Whether to retain homebuyers remains to be seen
The reporter learned from Nanjing Online Real Estate that the project received sales permits for a total of 252 units in two buildings in November last year. The unit areas are 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average price of full decoration sales permits is 39843 yuan/square meter.
However, more than two months have passed, and the online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the project is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%. Among them, there are 128 units in Building 8, and the number of unsold units is 113. There are also 44 unsold units out of 124 in Building 7. The total number of transactions in the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.
Market insiders introduced that the "price guarantee agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate project on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched a "price guarantee plan" to attract homebuyers. The specific content was "The company solemnly promises that if the discount of the project expands within one year, the company will refund the difference to the old owners."
Subsequently, in April 2011, nine real estate projects in Nanjing also promised "price difference compensation" for some properties.
"The real estate market is warming up, and it needs a 'cardiotonic' at this time.
"Mr. Shen, a senior operator in the Nanjing real estate industry, said that the "price guarantee agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He believes that developers need more confidence than homebuyers today, and the launch of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually to boost their morale.
As for whether it can retain homebuyers, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds. It remains to be seen at present.
Multiple Data Decline, Taiwan's Economy Starts the Year Poorly - China News Network
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11th (Reporters Zhao Bo, Huang Yang) With "five consecutive months of decline" in export trade volume, the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for the manufacturing industry has been contracting for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has seen a "3" again... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts analyze that Taiwan's economic performance at the beginning of the year is not good, and the pressure to grow is not small.
According to the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year were 31.51 billion US dollars, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, and a negative growth for the fifth consecutive month.
The export volume of the 11 main export categories all declined compared to the same period last year.
Plastics, rubber and their products, and optical equipment had the deepest declines, with year-on-year decreases of 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decrease in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits decreased by 18.3% year-on-year, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, the head of the department's statistics department, said that this shows that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry is spreading, and the electronics industry is entering a correction period.
Statistics show that in January, Taiwan's imports and exports both fell, and the surplus was only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the global terminal demand is decreasing, the industry adjusts inventory to suppress the willingness of manufacturers to purchase materials, and the export slump is difficult to improve in the short term, and Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.
According to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for Taiwan's manufacturing industry in January this year was 40.4% after seasonal adjustment, a decrease of 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and a contraction for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, the PMI takes 50% as the line of prosperity and decline. An index greater than 50% represents economic expansion, and vice versa is contraction.
In the five components of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and employment contracted, supplier delivery times fell, and inventory contracted.
All six major industries reported PMI contraction, with the industries ranked by contraction speed being the power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), the electronics and optics industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotech medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw materials industry (42.4%), the transportation tools industry (42.6%) and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Taiwan authorities' "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics" announced that the annual growth rate of Taiwan's CPI in January this year was 3.04%, breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, a new high in 17 months.
Cao Zhihong, a special member of the Taiwan "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics", admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was indeed beyond expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI for January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year. Inflation pressure still exists and is still at a high point.
Looking at Taiwan's economy this year, according to reports from domestic media such as the "United Daily News" and "Yahoo Finance", experts are pessimistic.
Wu Dare, a professor of economics at Taiwan's "Central University", analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies, and the risk of debt default is rising.
At the same time, the reduction in orders leads to manufacturers reducing labor costs, affecting the labor market and family economy, and in turn impacting consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that this year's inflation situation in Europe and America has not been resolved, demand continues to shrink, and it is estimated that Taiwan's export decline will continue into the first half of the year.
Because Taiwan's economy relies on exports, it will be affected by the sluggish exports, and the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.
"An Important Engine for Global Recovery" - China News Network
"In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development."
Julio Rios, a well-known Chinese affairs expert in Spain and honorary advisor to the China Policy Watch Network, said in a recent interview with our reporter that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has calmly responded with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is steadfastly expanding its openness to the outside world, the endogenous power of economic development is constantly strengthening, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are developing in coordination.
Every year, the two sessions of the National People's Congress of China are held, where representatives and members discuss the major plans for national development and hot issues of people's livelihood, widely gathering consensus, rallying people's hearts, and gathering wisdom, adding strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and has now entered a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions, and looks forward to China's development bringing new opportunities to the world.
" Rios said that China is currently promoting technological innovation with all its strength, injecting new impetus into economic and social development, "Investment in funds, talent cultivation, policy incentives, this makes China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan".
In Rios' view, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has both played the strengths of the market economy and the advantages of the socialist system, taking proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic base point of expanding domestic demand, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting private, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing development, insisting on innovative development, promoting employment, improving the income and living standards of the Chinese people, satisfying the people's multi-level and diversified consumption needs... China fully, accurately, and comprehensively implements the new development concept, strives to promote high-quality development, builds a new development pattern, and will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal of the "Belt and Road" initiative.
"Stabilizing and recovering the economy after the epidemic is a common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
" Rios said, looking forward to the continued role of the "Belt and Road" cooperation in improving the infrastructure level of various countries and strengthening interconnectivity in various fields, and continuing to release greater potential.

Henan Province standardizes and integrates the price of oral implant medical services - China News Network
CCTV News: Dental implants are the ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the price of tens of thousands per tooth has always deterred many patients.
Since this year, with the accelerated implementation of centralized procurement of dental implants, various places have also put the price reduction of dental implants on the agenda.
Starting from February 10, the full-process price control target for a single conventional dental implant medical service in Henan Province is 4300 yuan, and the full-process cost of a single conventional implant is not higher than 97% of the price control target.
Dental implants refer to a method of repairing missing teeth based on the lower structure implanted in the bone tissue to support and fix the upper dental prosthesis.
Reporters learned from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University that, taking a single conventional implant as an example, the price from implantation to final repair is about 16,000 to 17,000 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that in my case, it would be about 8,000 yuan, less than 10,000 yuan, basically saving half.
On the basis of the current project, Henan Province has also integrated and determined 15 oral implant medical service price items such as "implant implantation fee (single)", and uniformly formulated the price and medical insurance payment category of provincial public medical institutions, and cancelled or adjusted 20 medical service price items such as dental implant surgery.
Li Yunjie, Director of the Medical Price and Tendering and Procurement Department of Zhengzhou Medical Security Bureau: The main beneficiaries are four parties, one is medical insurance, which reduces the expenditure of medical insurance; the hospital's occupancy is reduced, and patients will increase appropriately; for suppliers, they have gained a market; for our patients, they are the biggest beneficiaries, the cost of implanting a tooth may be halved or even more.

"New Variables" Emerge in China's E-commerce Industry, How to Achieve "Content is King" in Sales?
-China News Network
China News Network, February 11th, headline: "New Variables" Emerge in China's E-commerce Industry, How to Achieve "Content is King" in Sales?
China News Finance Reporter Xia Bin
"We entered the e-commerce industry late, but from the very beginning, we realized that to stand out from the thousands of shops, content is very important.
" said Fangfang, a "post-90s" girl from Guangdong, who now operates a nourishing food ingredient shop on Douyin, making a 30-year-old offline shop "bloom" online.
Imitating the tone of old Hong Kong films and pairing it with classic Cantonese songs, opening @Fangfang's Douyin account, the exquisite videos are refreshing.
At the recent Douyin E-commerce "Finding Companions·Quality Content Sharing Session", Fangfang, as a representative of quality creators, spoke at the event, sharing her daily creative experiences and insights.
She said at the scene: "The carefully polished videos have attracted a lot of attention from netizens. Many people are interested in the ingredients in my shop and want to cook with them, which has opened up the sales channel.
"
Fangfang has made more people fall in love with the "old Cantonese taste" through her soup-making videos. In one live broadcast, she sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing food ingredients, saving her family's nearly bankrupt old shop.
"No content, no e-commerce," as short videos and live-streaming e-commerce continue to develop, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early stages of live-streaming sales, live-streaming rooms often attracted users with low-price discounts, and price advantages seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, both phenomenon-level influencers like Liu Genghong and Dongfang Selection, and many experts and merchants unknown to the public in vertical niche fields, have continuously created high-quality content that fits their brand tone, enhancing long-term operational benefits.
Gao Yaxuan, the person in charge of Douyin E-commerce's star author operations, said that in the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Douyin E-commerce, their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and their total transaction volume has also doubled.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving and vigorous author ecosystem.
" Gao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecology Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of the "new variable" - high-quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data dimension, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the e-commerce industry content ecology health index ranking in the aforementioned report, Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com are in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, which integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (Professionally Generated Content) and UGC (User Generated Content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the scenarios for consumption and promotion, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, the stronger the commercial value, and the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption in the public and private sectors.
At the scene, Yu Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, analyzed and interpreted the report.
He stated that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumption accessibility" to the "consumption quality" stage, and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and focus of the new stage of e-commerce development, and paid knowledge, professional knowledge, KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC content have become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecology from the perspective of content structure improvement, to create positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve a dynamic balance with the health system index of the e-commerce content ecology.
The other is to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment from the perspective of the external ecology.
"The future e-commerce industry still needs more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to form predictions for future development stability; in addition, to provide merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, to achieve value synergy and co-creation of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and to create a healthy content ecology.

Xinhua News Agency commentator
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project, which requires overall planning, systematic planning, and overall advancement, and correctly handles a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, adhering to the correct path and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up to the outside world.
"At the opening ceremony of the seminar for the new members of the Central Committee, alternate members and provincial and ministerial leaders to study and implement Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 20th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, deeply and systematically clarified a series of major relationships that need to be handled well in practice, and provided us with a scientific methodology for vigorously promoting Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and relates to party governance, national governance, military governance, domestic and foreign affairs, and defense. It requires both systematic planning and the courage to reform and innovate, and continuously achieve overall advancement.
Top-level design requires a deep insight into the world's development trends, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the people, a deep exploration of the laws of economic and social development, so that the formulated plans and policy systems reflect the characteristics of the times, grasp the regularity, and are full of creativity, achieving a combination of long-term and short-term, top-down and bottom-up, and coordinated content.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory endeavor, and there are still many unknown areas. We need to boldly explore in practice, promote the development of the cause through reform and innovation, and we must not stick to the old ways and wait for opportunities.
The strategic issue is a fundamental issue for a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we need to enhance the foresight of the strategy, scientifically foresee the future and lead the future with the strategy; we need to enhance the overall nature of the strategy, focusing on solving major issues that affect the rise and fall of the party and the country's cause; we need to enhance the stability of the strategy, once the strategy is formed, we must persist in the long term, grasp it to the end, and do a good job.
We must scientifically grasp the dialectical unity of strategy and tactics, organically combine the principled nature of strategy and the flexibility of tactics, be flexible and adaptable, make decisions on the spot, and grasp the strategic initiative in adapting to local conditions and taking advantage of the situation.
The Chinese nation is a nation that adheres to the correct path and innovates.

(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Biden administration will blacklist six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in a spy balloon program this Friday (February 10).
The U.S. Department of Commerce stated that these five Chinese companies and one research institution are aiding the modernization of the Chinese military, especially in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist will find it difficult to obtain U.S. technology exports.
The list is known as the "Entity List", and companies on it will not be able to purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group's 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House indicated that it was considering taking broader measures to "expose and deal with" larger-scale surveillance activities threatening U.S. national security by China.
The balloon incident has further escalated tensions between China and the U.S., and U.S. Secretary of State Blinken has cancelled his trip to China.
On February 4, the U.S. shot down a balloon, and the Chinese government lodged a serious protest with the U.S. embassy in China, criticizing the U.S. for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and progress of stabilizing Sino-U.S. relations.
Based on the evidence from the existing wreckage and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon "has a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and is a supplier approved by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding an accidental incident where a Chinese unmanned civilian airship entered U.S. airspace due to force majeure.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, she added that the relevant resolution of the U.S. Congress is purely political manipulation and hype.
China strongly disapproves and firmly opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce in charge of export enforcement, stated: "Today's action shows that we have identified and stopped China's joint efforts to use spy balloons that have violated the airspace of the United States and more than 40 other countries.
"
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he was unaware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on this information.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese) Several days have passed since the earthquake in parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is fading. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday brought great relief to the rescuers.
According to the Associated Press, in the heavily affected town of Nurdai in Gaziantep province, this family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days.
Rescuers first pulled the mother and daughter from the rubble, then found the father, who insisted on rescuing his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in harsh cold weather conditions.
"What day is it today?
" - the boy who had been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the rescuer who brought him back to the surface.

Miraculous successful rescue cases brought a glimmer of hope to the originally hopeless rescue work, but at the same time, the number of casualties is also rising.
According to official statistics, Monday's earthquake has caused more than 20,000 deaths in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be over 3,500.
Although experts say that people can survive for more than a week after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors is becoming increasingly slim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life under the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of the rescue work has begun to shift towards helping those survivors who are in urgent need of assistance.

"Google AI Chatbot 'Answers Wrong Question', Parent Company's Stock Evaporates Hundreds of Billions of Dollars"
(Comprehensive news on the 11th)
Google's newly launched artificial intelligence chatbot Bard got off to a bad start, "answering the wrong question" in the promotional video, causing Google's parent company Alphabet's stock to plummet by 8.9% on Wednesday, breaking the $100 mark, and the market value evaporated $110 billion (about 476.5 billion ringgit), closing at $94.57 on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as competitive as Microsoft.
According to a Reuters report, Google earlier posted a promotional video of the AI chatbot Bard on social media, in which someone asked Bard, "What new discoveries about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year-old child?
" Bard mentioned in the answer that the telescope had taken the first photo of an exoplanet.
However, according to data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the first photo of an exoplanet was taken by the "Very Large Telescope" of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters reported with the headline "Alphabet's stock plummets after Bard's wrong answer".
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "highlighted the importance of rigorous testing processes", and would combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's responses "meet high standards in terms of quality, safety, and accurate information".
Singapore's tourism industry recovers strongly, with inbound tourists increasing 19 times compared to 2021
(Comprehensive news on the 11th) The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that it is expected that the number of international tourists visiting Singapore in 2023 will reach 12 to 14 million, bringing about 18 to 21 billion Singapore dollars in tourism revenue; the number of tourists and tourism revenue will recover to about 67% to 75% of the level before the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019; there is a high possibility of a full recovery of the tourism industry in 2024.
In 2022, Singapore's tourism market gradually restarted and recovered.
The latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that the number of inbound tourists in 2022 increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million, surpassing the earlier estimate of 4 to 6 million by the Tourism Board, and tourists have recovered to 33% of the level before the pandemic.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled 8.96 billion Singapore dollars, and it is expected that the total tourism revenue for 2022 will reach 13.8 to 14.3 billion Singapore dollars, an increase of 6 to 7 times from 1.89 billion Singapore dollars in 2021, and has recovered to about 50% to 52% of the level before the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced a grant of nearly 500 million Singapore dollars to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The Tourism Board recently announced that it plans to allocate 110 million Singapore dollars from this budget over the next two years to launch more business and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In order to make health and wellness one of the highlights of Singapore's tourism, the Singapore Tourism Board launched a call for proposals on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have put physical health at the top of their considerations.
Developing a health and wellness attraction in the Marina South area, which has the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism industry and economy, allowing tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
Chen Jianlong, Director of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in the next few years, health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
For this reason, the Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness projects to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with more than 130 various health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, Central Beach Market in Sentosa, the new "Exploring New Territories" exhibition hall at the ArtScience Museum, and the newly built open-air theater at the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Bird Park at Wildlife Reserves Singapore, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will establish industry standards for the sustainable development of the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) industry within 2023, and focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions, further optimizing the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Changi Airport has strongly recovered, with as many as 150,000 passengers received daily, about 1 million per week, which is about 75% of the level before the COVID-19 outbreak, and the number of aviation industry employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the level before the pandemic.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million tourists, which is 42% of the level before the COVID-19 outbreak, and 170,000 flights have taken off and landed, which is 53% of the level before the pandemic.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery of industries such as accommodation, transportation, catering, and shopping.
The Singapore government and the tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Ke Shudan, Assistant Director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that a survey by a Chinese travel platform shows that Singapore's safety index ranks among the top three in the world, which is also one of the reasons why Singapore is popular with Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 outbreak, about 3.6 million Chinese people traveled to Singapore for vacations each year.
With China relaxing its border policy, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists this year can recover to 30% to 60% of the level in 2019.
Ke Shudan pointed out that next, the Tourism Board will closely monitor signals from China for further relaxation of outbound travel policies to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking forward to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that as long as there is no significant economic downturn affecting public income, and no new large-scale fatal epidemic outbreaks, the recovery of the tourism industry will be faster than expected.
Kim Jong-un's intimate interaction with his daughter, wife left out in the cold
(Comprehensive news on the 11th) North Korea held the 75th anniversary parade of the Army Day on the evening of the 8th, and Kim Jong-un's daughter, Kim Ju-ae, not only attended, but also stood on the podium with her father.
North Korean official media released a video on the 9th, showing Kim Ju-ae snuggling next to her father, exchanging warm glances and whispers several times. She gently held her father's cheeks with both hands, even touching his chest, and the father-daughter interaction was broadcasted nationwide.
However, the first lady, Ri Sol-ju, could only step aside.
According to reports from South Korea's "Chosun News" and other media, Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju took their daughter Kim Ju-ae to attend the official group photo of the banquet on the 7th. Kim Ju-ae not only sat in the middle of her parents, but also stood on the podium with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary parade of the Army Day on the following evening.
North Korean official media "Korean Central Television" later released a video of the parade, revealing more scenes of deep father-daughter affection.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium, the smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered to each other. Kim Ju-ae once held her father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media footage also showed that when Kim Ju-ae and Kim Jong-un were sitting on the indoor sofa, she kept touching her father's face with her hand; when she walked hand in hand with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hand.
However, the first lady, Ri Sol-ju, could only walk behind or sit aside the whole time, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Ju-ae first appeared in public on November 18 last year during the test launch of the Mars 17 missile, her exposure rate has been increasing over the past three months, and this is already her fifth appearance at an official event.
When North Korean official media mentioned Kim Ju-ae, they used extremely high honorifics such as "the most beloved sibling" and "the noble sibling", and also broadcasted clips of Kim Ju-ae repeatedly shouting her allegiance to the Baekdu bloodline while overlooking the parade.
These signs have led outsiders to suspect whether Kim Ju-ae has been designated as the successor of the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un is pushing his middle school-aged daughter to the position of successor", but there are also views that such a judgment is still premature, and in the situation where Kim Jong-un has a son, all possibilities are still preserved.
Chongyang Q&A | How to view the US non-farm employment data for January exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, how do you view the US non-farm employment data for January exceeding expectations and future trends?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor announced the non-farm employment data for January 2023, with an increase of 517,000 non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly wages increased by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, slightly slowing down.
In terms of total volume, there are many one-time and technical factors disturbing this data, such as returning teachers from strikes, corrections to survey statistics, updates to seasonal adjustment factors, and subsequent corrections may be made (refer to the revision of non-farm additions in January 2022 from 504,000 to 364,000), non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data shows.
In terms of structure, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still there, but the proportion is low; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care have seen a significant rebound in new jobs, and the data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
Combining the similarly exceeding expectations of the service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor gap data rebounding, and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has undergone rapid repair after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that without a recession, it is difficult to improve the supply and demand tension in the US job market.
Currently, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old is already close to the pre-pandemic peak.
In addition, due to the strong excess savings and consumer credit of US residents, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the job market.
The continued tension in the supply and demand of the US job market will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.
Adding to the current near-end of interest rate hikes, inflation expectations are constantly repeating, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth.
Before the data was released, the US stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were too optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Federal Reserve is shortening the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market ignores the Federal Reserve's hawkish statements, not only expecting to stop raising interest rates in advance, but also expecting two rate cuts at the end of the year.
In the case of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Federal Reserve's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some damage to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the year-on-year M2 data turning negative and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-item leading indicators, the US CPI data has entered a rapid decline stage since October, and the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.
Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led China's first listed clothing company to transform - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zheng Yu Xin, February 11, the WeChat public account certified by Shanshan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") announced that Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and the chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died of a sudden heart disease on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. With his transfer, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Shares.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of Shanshan brand once reached 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Shares (600884.SH) was listed, becoming the first listed company in China's clothing industry.
Just when the clothing business was booming, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and it is not likely that Shanshan suits will always lead the trend and become the national dress of the Chinese people in the long term".
In 1999, Shanshan began to study corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what to transform, and specifically sought many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and theoretical seminars.
In the end, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that big health has a future".
After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, which was supporting Ansteel, was conducting a national 863 project. The research funding was not enough, so Shanshan and Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere", engage in the research, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and promote the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.
In 2001, Shanshan Shares realized the mass production of intermediate phase carbon microspheres, began to replace imports, and replaced Japan as the main supplier of intermediate phase carbon microspheres in China.
This is China's first lithium-ion battery negative electrode material production enterprise, realizing the localization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials.
With the rapid popularization of lithium batteries, Shanshan Shares' lithium battery business began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into the main business of Shanshan Shares. The revenue of the clothing business decreased year by year. Until 2013, the revenue of Shanshan Shares' lithium battery material business completely surpassed the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Shares successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company, Shangjin Optoelectronics. The technology content in this field is relatively high, and Shanshan's main competitors are all Fortune 500 companies, such as Samsung in South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical in Japan, and Nitto Denko in Japan.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, "The success rate of Chinese private enterprises acquiring some high-tech enterprises internationally is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, right? This is a behavior that is usually done", but Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day Shanshan successfully acquired, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shangjin Optoelectronics that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shangjin, decided to implement a one-enterprise-two-systems policy. Except for Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, Shanshan's people will not be sent to Shangjin. They will adopt an authorized operation method, and the original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management modes will remain unchanged.
ICC Xinling Information released negative electrode data for 2022, showing that Shanshan's negative electrode shipment volume broke through 200,000 tons in 2022, an increase of 100% year-on-year, with a market share of 16%, and the shipment volume of artificial graphite negative electrode materials topped the list.
In terms of polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the company's Shangjin Optoelectronics' global market share reached 29% in 2022, and it is expected that the market share will reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Shares' revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, and on February 10, the stock price of Shanshan Shares was 19.24 yuan/share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan Shares stated on the interactive platform that at the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity was about 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project was still climbing.
Wind shows that Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan Shares.
Tianyancha shows that Zheng Yonggang holds a total equity ratio of 40.1% in Shanshan Holdings Limited.
The general manager of Shanshan Shares is Li Zhihua, born in 1968, who has served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Shares Co., Ltd.
Shanshan Shares stated on the investor interaction platform on February 10 that there is no kinship between the senior management of the company and the actual controller of the company.
"Fund E-account" is here: CSRC authorizes development, all funds under investor's name can be consolidated and queried - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Chen Shan: Is it difficult to consolidate account information due to the complex channels of fund purchase?
Always forgetting your "small treasury"?
These problems of fund investors are about to be solved.
On February 10, the CSRC announced that the "Fund E-account" APP has been launched in various mobile app stores and is undergoing public beta testing.
According to the introduction, the "Fund E-account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" query service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve the industry service pain points such as forgetting accounts and cumbersome queries for the majority of small and medium investors.
According to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, managing about 26 trillion yuan in funds; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
The account systems of each share registration institution are independent of each other, lacking a unified industry query channel.
Some industry insiders said that by the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China, which means that half of the people in the country have invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to query purchase conditions through different sales institutions, but through the "Fund E-account", they can query the purchase conditions of all sales channels, and the situation of holding funds is clear at a glance.
What is the "Fund E-account" APP?
According to related documents, the "Fund E-account" APP is a public fund industry portal mobile application developed and built by China Settlement with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which can provide investors with a one-stop query of the off-market shareholding situation of all market public fund products.
Investors can conveniently and quickly grasp their own off-market shareholding situation of public fund products purchased through all market sales channels through the "Fund E-account", greatly improving the efficiency of queries.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through the "Fund E-account" includes: the fund account information opened at all public fund managers in the market, the trading account information opened at public fund sales institutions, and the off-market shareholding situation of products including publicly raised securities investment funds and collective asset management plans managed by securities companies with no limit on the number of investors.
Liu Yiqian, the business head of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told the Economic Observer Network reporter that investors can know all their off-market public fund holdings through the "Fund E-account" App, help them find "forgotten assets", and more importantly, it has realized the collection of all account information of comprehensive fund investment for customers, helping customers to grasp their own investment situation more timely, accurately and completely, so as to better optimize their own fund portfolio allocation and better plan their own financial arrangements.
How to register and use?
The reporter noticed that at present, the "Fund E-account" APP has been launched in Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo and other mobile app stores, but the APP is still in the public beta testing stage, registration requires an invitation code, investors can contact the fund manager of the fund they hold to obtain.
A customer service staff member of a medium and large public fund in Shanghai provided the Economic Observer Network reporter with a six-digit invitation code, and told the reporter, "During the APP beta testing stage, China Settlement provides each fund manager with a certain number of invitation codes. When investors call to get them, we will provide them.
After the beta testing is over, when user registration is opened, no invitation code is needed.
"
The reporter registered an account and completed the query according to the "Fund E-account" download and use instructions related documents displayed on the CSRC official website. The whole process took only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund query.
After the real-name authentication step, click the "Asset" fund binding button, all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are presented in the binding option list (accounts that can be bound), after the binding is completed, you can directly see the total assets of the invested funds and can start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E-account" only provides query services for investors and cannot carry out redemption transactions.

United States, Japan, and Philippines Reach Defense Consensus Against the CCP
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's infringement of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement stating that they will sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States, conduct substantive defense exchanges, and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishida hopes that this meeting will help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis.
In early January of this year, Marcos visited China and obtained an agreement worth 20 billion US dollars.
However, after this, not only did Sino-Philippine relations not improve, but they declined.
At the beginning of this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the US military to ensure the security of the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan and is also the closest point to China.
If a crisis occurs in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from its bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States, building a "CCP confrontation arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Liyan, visits China to convey Song Tao's message: Under the 1992 Consensus, the Green Camp is welcome to visit the mainland.
Taiwan's Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan has met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People's Republic of China, Song Tao, and the Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Wang Huning.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Kuomintang's official organization, the National Policy Foundation, praised Song Tao's message to Xia Liyan in an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, stating that as long as one recognizes the "1992 Consensus" and opposes Taiwan independence, China welcomes Green Camp members to visit the mainland.
The Kuomintang considers this a fresh development.
Xia Liyan's earlier meeting with Song Tao did not mention this statement in the news of the day.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has been clarifying its refusal to accept the "1992 Consensus" in recent days.
According to the Central News Agency today, Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan led a delegation to visit the mainland, meeting with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, the newly appointed Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, Song Tao, and the Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, Yin Li.
During the meeting between Xia Liyan and Song Tao, they discussed that the political foundation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the "1992 Consensus" and opposition to Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the National Policy Foundation of the Kuomintang, stated in the meeting that the Kuomintang's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this is different from the previous meetings he attended.
Recently, in video conferences with mainland academia and in this conference, there was no mention of Taiwan scholars discussing military unification and the "Anti-Secession Law". Instead, the focus was on resuming exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the cross-strait situation is tense, and mainland China hopes to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the people and the communists, the other party is still willing to work for the people of Taiwan, indicating that they do not want to ruin cross-strait relations.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao to "implement the demands raised by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen)". If they cannot be resolved as a whole, they should be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang members visiting the mainland raised the issue of Chinese military aircraft and warships harassing Taiwan daily, the agricultural and fishing issues in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the Central News Agency reporters asked such questions.
Trade unions mobilize again to protest against the government's pension reform plan
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions once again launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's pension reform draft, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in this social trend against the government's pension reform draft.
How many people respond to the rally call may affect the next steps of the union groups.
This is the fourth nationwide mobilization jointly launched by the eight major French trade unions in a month, and it is also the first time that this protest activity has been scheduled for Saturday.
Considering that for most French people, Saturday is a day off, they do not need to choose between participating in protest demonstrations or going on strike with pay cuts, so the union groups hope that today's rally can attract more people to participate.
The unions of the public transport system, the subway, and the public railway company did not call for a strike today, the public transport system should be able to operate normally, and citizens can take the bus to the rally site, and in areas where schools start winter vacation, people can start their vacation normally.
The union groups hope that more than one million people will participate in the rally today, while the police expect the national participation to be between 600,000 and 800,000, and the Paris city area may gather between 90,000 and 120,000 people.
Since the start of this protest against the government's pension reform plan, although polls show that most French people do not support the measure to postpone the statutory retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people who actually take to the streets to participate in the parade has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people nationwide.
And the crowd of demonstrators this Tuesday (February 7) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
The pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition, especially the radical left-led opposition groups, have submitted countless amendments, so the review process is very slow.
And the debate between the ruling and opposition parties is becoming increasingly fierce.
A member of the radical left-wing party, the Unbowed France Party, recently posted a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor on social media, which sparked protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly finally announced a ban on this member from participating in parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for this behavior.
Although this reform plan has sparked the largest social trend in France in more than 20 years, so far, although the government has made some adjustments to the draft, it has not made any major concessions.
The union is already preparing to take action again on Thursday, the 16th, and on March 7, when the reform draft is submitted to the Senate for discussion, the union also plans to organize a demonstration.
China encourages higher birth rates, urges donations of sperm in universities with high standards
On the 9th, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province, China, issued a call for donations from those with a college degree or above, or students, stating that successful donations 8 to 12 times could receive a subsidy of 4500 RMB.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message quickly became a hot topic on Weibo, and sparked similar initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing.
According to a report by the Liberty Times, China is encouraging college students to donate sperm.
Among all the universities, the threshold for sperm donation in Beijing is the highest. In addition to educational qualifications, they also require a height of 170 cm or above, a well-proportioned face, no obvious hair loss, and myopia not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province pointed out that sperm donors can receive a full set of men's health check-ups worth 1000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome tests, most people have never done it, which is of great significance for understanding their own fertility status."
The conditions for sperm donors include a height of 165 cm or above, a college degree or above or currently studying, no color blindness or weakness, and no genetic diseases or infectious diseases such as hepatitis B.
The report quoted China's Tianmu News as saying that the Human Sperm Bank of Shaanxi Province has printed promotional posters with the slogan "Paid sperm donation, unlimited glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to forward related messages, "let love pass on".
The price in Shaanxi Province is higher than in Yunnan, and qualified donors can receive 300 RMB in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of donations can receive a subsidy of 5000 RMB.
And currently, the highest known price is in Beijing, with the highest subsidy of 5150 RMB.
The last Communist Prime Minister of East Germany passed away today.
The successors of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement, "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
Thus, our party has lost an important leader.
"
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Modrow stated that he would help transform East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, due to protesters across East Germany demanding democracy and freedom, the Communist Party leaders were forced to step down.
After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for reforms in Eastern Europe under Soviet leadership.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free election of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as Prime Minister.
Although Modrow carried out reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that occurred in October 1990.
He was also criticized for trying to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was found guilty of election fraud in the municipal elections of May 1989, but was not imprisoned.
Some say these charges were politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modrow saw himself as a reformer and wanted to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said that East Germany's achievements should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the small German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland) and received training as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a youth fire brigade leader and became a member of the Nazi militia organization Volkssturm, which drafted men aged 16 to 60 for the final struggle of the war, as the conflict was nearing its end.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a staunch Communist.
In 1949, the year East Germany was established, he returned home to find a job as a mechanic, continued to study social sciences and economics, and earned a doctorate.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young people in East Germany joined, and he rose to become the chairman of the Dresden regional party through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution, hackers supporting the protest hacked the president's TV speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted the TV speech of President Ebrahim Raisi.
The president's live TV speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, and the screen showed the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers, their name is "Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)".
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic".
According to Reuters today, Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution, hackers interrupt national television reports.
Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Raisi's hardline government is facing the boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their resignation, but Raisi still calls on the "deceived youth" to repent, so they can get the pardon of Iran's supreme leader.
After 22-year-old Amini Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the country's moral police in September, nationwide protests are still sweeping Iran.
Iran's security forces have carried out deadly repression against protests, which is one of the strongest challenges faced by the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2500-year-old monarchy.
As part of the amnesty for the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities released Fahad Mesami, a jailed dissident who was on a hunger strike, and Fariba Adelkhah, an Iranian-French scholar, on Friday.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty order, which included some prisoners arrested in recent anti-government protests.
According to a report by the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report said that 70 government security personnel were also killed.
It is believed that as many as 19,763 protesters were arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for voting at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On Friday night of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration, and people shouted "Allahu Akbar!
(God is the greatest!)".
However, many people at the rally also shouted "Death to the dictator!
" and "Death to the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in all provinces.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebration, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment were displayed.
President Raisi's speech was often interrupted by the slogan "Death to America" - a signature slogan at the provincial rallies.
The crowd also shouted "Death to Israel".
Reuters said that Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, which is a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 for national security crimes.
They later put her under house arrest, but she returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah denied these charges.
A week before Mesami was released, supporters warned that he was at risk of death due to a hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of a headscarf.
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday, calling for her freedom to be restored, "including allowing her to return to France if she wishes.
"
Did the balloon incident further open America's eyes?
Strengthening restrictions on technology exports to China
According to the Wall Street Journal today, after the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials said that the aforementioned balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and will garner more political support for strengthening U.S. technology protection.
The United States claims that the balloon carried antennas and sensors used for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and now working at the New America Security Center in Washington.
"This undoubtedly adds fuel to the fire, supporting the views of the hardliners against China."
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking a wider range of actions to expose and respond to China's larger-scale surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security as well as our allies and partners.
"U.S. officials said they have informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the aforementioned balloon incident, and international coordination is crucial in dealing with the threat from China.
Emily Benso, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established U.S. House of Representatives' Special Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party may also pressure the U.S. to take stricter measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which could in turn force the White House to adopt tougher policies.
The Wall Street Journal reported that many advocates for stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also developing a foreign investment review plan to examine whether U.S. investments abroad pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to roll out the plan more quickly.
Relief efforts for the Turkey-Syria earthquake continue day and night
Since the strong earthquake in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working tirelessly in the ruins of thousands of destroyed buildings, rescuing survivors buried under the rubble.
In the cold temperatures, they often call for silence, as they strive to hear any signs of life from the piles of broken concrete.
According to Reuters today, two more women were rescued from the earthquake rubble after surviving for several days.
However, the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey is 20,665, and the death toll in Syria exceeds 3,500.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday, followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and close to the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years, and rescuers in Turkey rescued the two women from the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Another injured 55-year-old man was identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the cold temperatures, rescuers often call for silence, as they strive to hear any signs of life from the piles of broken concrete.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - they carefully reached into the rubble and rescued a 10-day-old newborn.
With his eyes wide open, baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warming blanket and taken to a field hospital.
Video images show that his mother was also taken away by paramedics, she was dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but conscious.
Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people were rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and a total of 31,000 rescuers were mobilized in the disaster area.
He said that about 80,000 people are being treated in hospitals, and 1.05 million people are homeless due to the earthquake, crowding into temporary shelters.
As many people lack food in the cold winter conditions, there is increasing public skepticism about the leaders' response to the disaster.
According to Syrian state media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly his first visit to the disaster area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said that due to the state of war making relief work complicated, its stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria are about to run out.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Adiyaman province in Turkey, admitting that the government's response did not meet the expected speed.
Opponents seized on this issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a vote on May 14, but it may be postponed due to the disaster.
Reuters said that anger over delays in providing aid and launching rescue operations could affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdogan's 20-year rule.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called a "negative campaign for political gain."
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition party in Turkey, criticized the government's response.
Critics said, "The earthquake was big, but what's worse than the earthquake is the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence.

Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi - Vietnam News Agency special correspondent reports that during his visit to the Sultanate of Brunei, on the morning of February 11, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, also known as "University of Brunei").
The University of Brunei is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, ranking third in the regional university rankings.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei officially established a cooperative relationship with Vietnam's FPT University, with the main area of cooperation being English training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese, and Korean, the University of Brunei has also included Vietnamese in its curriculum.
During the visit to the University of Brunei, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife interacted with students from the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is pleased that more and more foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, thereby actively contributing to the promotion of Vietnamese cultural characteristics and local customs to the world.

What exactly is the "object" shot down over Alaska?
It's confusing, with many speculations.
On Friday afternoon (February 10), the U.S. military once again used the most advanced stealth jet fighter F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska.
The location of the shootdown was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the U.S. military has shot down an airborne object.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed in the air near the coast of South Carolina after drifting over U.S. airspace for several days.
The Pentagon said that the second object shot down first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military while moving over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), its size is about the same as a small car, much smaller than the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.
The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no evidence to suggest that this object is controllable.
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said on Friday that although the exact appearance of this high-flying object is not clear, it "poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aircraft."
Kirby said that this object is different from the spy balloon found in the U.S., it does not have a "payload" hanging on it.
Kirby said, "We call it an 'object' is the best description we can make at the moment."
President Biden ordered the shootdown of this object after listening to the advice of the Pentagon, he was "very cautious" when he made this decision, Kirby added.
The U.S. official description of this object can be summarized as: about the size of a small car, no joystick, no hanging device, flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But this information still can't answer basic questions, such as what exactly is this object, which country does it belong to, and what mission is it carrying out.
Many online analyses and speculations currently believe that this might be another Chinese balloon.
It may come from China like the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon floating over Latin America, they are carrying out some kind of mission at different locations.
Some people have linked this "object" in Alaska with "Unidentified Flying Objects" (UFOs).
A report in Newsweek quoted a tweet from former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer on Friday saying, "I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."
"The irony of conflating alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar conflict," Meijer said.
Meijer tweeted this shortly after Kirby confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said that Meijer is not the only one who suspects that this object is a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month, calling on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on "unidentified flying objects."
The customer service attitude of Amazon is hard for me to believe.
I guess few people will read this, but I still want to say a little bit.
The clothing we bought at the time was a zip-up hoodie, but what was finally delivered to me was a short sleeve.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon's customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested an exchange, the customer service said they would solve it, and then I immediately saw the product name changed to short sleeve, and the link I originally bought was taken down.
Then the customer service notified me to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.
Is this Amazon's way of handling it?
It's really hard to believe. The wrong delivery of the clothes is not my problem. As a consumer, I demand to get the goods I should get. I didn't make any exaggerated demands, but Amazon changed the name and said there was no stock.
This is my first long review, I hope this is not my last one.
Incomprehensible sleeves
They say it's made of cowhide, and it is indeed quite hard, but if you look closely, there are many tiny cracks in certain areas, making it unclear whether it's real leather. Moreover, the sleeves of this garment are truly incomprehensible. Usually, the sleeves of a jacket are longer than the hem, but typically only by 1-2 centimeters. This garment, however, is a full 5 centimeters longer. When the arm naturally hangs down, it should be at the position of the tiger's mouth of the palm, but the sleeves of this garment cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and returning them is also easy.
But when will the money be refunded?
The clothes are well made, but because the size is too small, I had to return them. However, after returning the goods, it has been more than a week and I have not received a refund yet?
Moreover, the buyer has to contact Quanfeng Express, which is not very trustworthy. This is the worst shopping experience I've had since buying items from Amazon!
But the store is still good, actively cooperating to urge the courier to refund in time, but the work of this Quanfeng Express is really infuriating, dragging on for about half a month before refunding. This kind of partner is going to drag Amazon down, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!
More suitable for young people.
It's a 99-second kill.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the woolen pants are all good, soft/thin and moderate, without a kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the style is slim, more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist 2 feet 5, maximum stretch size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg wearing a bit tight on the waist.
It seems that there is no elastic band at the waist, it's quite difficult to add a loose waist.
Also, it's uncomfortable to wear close to the body.
Very good, the color is not very bright.
I just bought it and it went up by more than two hundred, what's going on.
This is the first time Amazon used the cooperative Tiantian rotten express, the first time the delivery was not at home, then I actively made two delivery appointments with the courier, that courier did not deliver, then directly returned the goods to me, this damn courier has no integrity at all, strongly suggest not to use that Tiantian rotten express again.
This time there is also a T-shirt that was returned to me, and the price has gone up by more than a hundred yuan if I take another shot.
Amazon's self-operated business should not have such products.
I bought the product when it was on special offer, the price was not low, and the reviews were also very good.
When I actually received the product, I was dumbfounded. The surface of the product was largely worn, and there were wear and tear in many other places. It was either a substandard product or a used one, I will upload pictures later.
I applied for a return, and the manufacturer's representative said it was caused by transportation after seeing the pictures. Isn't this nonsense?
How could the inside of the product be worn?
There are only two possibilities, either it's a substandard or used product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but considering my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I believe such products should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Customers choose Amazon's self-operated products because they trust them. Customer win, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone will work together to improve. Thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year, and two E2s have appeared, I don't know how to deal with it?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often showed red E2, which should be a problem with the transmitter module, right? This doesn't quite match what the Amazon website says about the transmitter module being able to work continuously for 7 years, right? I can't find after-sales service on the Amazon website, and now I don't know what to do?
It's okay.
The first purchase was faulty.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the body was also broken.
And it keeps going white screen.
It got better after it was replaced.
The exchange was quite fast, it's a bit blurry at night, the view angle is not very wide, but it's enough for ordinary home use.
The only drawback is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I have bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.
There will be stickers on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened, but not this time. When buying a mobile phone, there is a sticker-like stamp that can be stuck on the warranty card, but not this time.
I don't know if it's because the things are cheaper, there is none, it's very confusing.
Waiting for the supplier's response.
The packaging has no markings, I directly called the supplier and they said that the lack of markings indicates it's genuine. If in doubt, you can send scrap materials to Johnson & Johnson for inspection. They also left their license plate number and phone number, promising to send a text message to input my information into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card on their official website. But I haven't received a text message yet?
Received the engine oil in the morning, and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
I am quite confident in Amazon's self-operated products.
The mechanic who changed the oil said the oil is clear and indeed good quality.
Because it's my second purchase.
So I am quite confident.
The delivery was super fast, the packaging had no faults, and after using this oil, the engine noise noticeably decreased.
The cost performance is good, it's hard to find synthetic engine oil under 200.
Support Xingguan, support Shengpai, effective protection for the car.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (8c caterpillar shipped as 8cm caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admitting the mistake, but always shirking, always emphasizing that the goods are third-party and cannot constrain the third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
The size options on the page I originally purchased were 7c, 8, 9c. I felt this was a trap at the time. I called the Chinese customer service of Amazon Japan and was clearly told that 8 is 8c. But when the goods returned to China, I found out it was only 8cm. I think this is a trap deliberately set to pit Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales). Now this option is no longer available on the page.
Chinese customer service: We are very sorry for your loss. We give you two options:
1. You return the goods, and the buyer bears all shipping costs.
2. You don't return the goods, we compensate you 1000 yen.
(I calculated the account, the shoes are more than 4000 yen, counted as 200rmb, choose 1, I have no shoes, the loss is 200 yuan.
Choose 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2000 yen, the final loss is 150rmb) Customer service: We have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously, and sent an email the next day, saying that I do not accept the mediation of Chinese customer service, and that's it.
I proposed: When the purchase page is 7c, 8, 9c such confusing options, the Chinese customer service told me that the commonly used codes in Japan will not carry c like this, similar to 140, but have you guys gone to other caterpillar pages to see?
There are situations where American codes and Japanese codes are mixed.
Moreover, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, which is clearly the smallest size, what does it mean to put it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know that you want to ship back to the country, so we will not compensate for your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic. I am Japanese. I still need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service. Tourists to Japan don't have the time to make international long-distance calls. So the question is, who needs to call Amazon overseas purchase Chinese phone, nothing more than people like me who shop in Japan.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just to facilitate people like us who shop overseas?
I'm not very satisfied with this purchase.
This is the second time I've bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I once bought a box when the baby was 2 months old, choosing diapers made of imported European paper. The first purchase experience was quite satisfactory. The baby used only one diaper all night, which indeed could last for 12 hours without changing.
But this time I bought size L diapers, there are 2 packs separately packaged in a box. After opening, I felt that the paper was rather loose, which was significantly different from the imported Pampers. After using it for the baby, it was okay, there was no leakage or signs of rash.
But when it came to the second pack of diapers, as soon as I started using them, a rash appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs, which has not faded yet.
I suspect that the 2 packs in one box are not even of the same quality.
I probably won't continue to buy in the future!
Hope to pay attention to the protection of package transportation.
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen in my online shopping experience, there are no protective measures at all, no buffering foam, no package buffering layer materials, nothing.
Just a deformed box.
And the soft plastic box inside, the card box has been crushed and deformed.
I hope it's genuine and quality assured, I'm not so brave to buy things from Amazon in the future.
I'd rather pay half more domestically, for more assurance.
And the problem with product packaging, I saw comments in 2016, and now it's 2019, it's still the same.
This shows that Amazon doesn't pay attention to service feedback at all, it's far behind domestic Jingdong, Tmall and others.
Pretty, but a bit of a pity.
The color of the entire cup is one I really like, orange-red, even though I have a boy at home, I still think orange-red paired with yellow is very eye-catching.
It's a bit smaller than I imagined, but it was originally for taking out, so it's still acceptable.
I tried it at home last night, after opening the bottle cap, the distance between the straw and the cap is too close, because the position of the straw is vertically straight, so my son always has to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water, I wonder if this can be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups make the straw slanted for a reason, children's things, really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and Large Capacity
I like its lightness and large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit redundant to me, I'm not sure what to put in them.
After purchasing, I found a similar one from another brand on the overseas purchase section of Amazon, which costs less than two hundred yuan.
Fake goods, extremely fake.
Amazon sells fake goods, I'm really speechless.
Customer service said that because it's been used, it can't be returned. How would I know it's fake if I didn't use it?
Because of trust, I'm heartbroken. After all, it's a facial product. Just go to a physical store to buy it, even if it's a bit more expensive.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't look at the reviews. I have already reported it to the National Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's protect our rights together.
Broken?
Fake?
It's a tragedy anyway.
When I used the second piece, I chose the one for fine pores, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. But when I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it at all. The smell was very strong, indescribable, and it made me cough immediately. My eyes were also very painful and teary, so I immediately took it off and washed my face.
I didn't believe it and opened another one of the same kind, the smell was not so strong this time, and I'm applying it now.
In retrospect, it smells a bit like the poor quality perm solution in hair salons.
I really can't imagine, do I have to avoid Amazon's own skincare products from now on?
Unscrupulous merchants indeed.
When I made the purchase, the promotion on the page stated that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given for free with purchases over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when I received the goods. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them a screenshot of the promotion at that time. The problem is, who saves screenshots of the webpage when they make purchases? You need customers to provide evidence for the promotions you have run? Buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.
Post-use Feelings
This is my first time shopping on Amazon, and I have several impressions to share. Let's start with my feelings after using the product. Firstly, it is indeed painless and doesn't have any irritating smell. Overall, it's pretty good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, it can be wiped off easily, leaving only a small amount of hair residue on the surface, which is not noticeable unless you look closely. So overall, it's pretty good. As for the future, I need to continue observing and using it to know more.
Anyway, I think this product is really good.
Secondly, I placed the order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery service of Amazon is also very good.
Thirdly, don't believe in Amazon's Black Friday. I placed an order on Friday, and after waiting for 2 days, the price dropped by nearly 12 dollars, which means I bought it for more than 170 (including shipping fees), giving me a feeling that they raise prices during promotions.
Customer service mentioned price fluctuations, but I've been monitoring for more than 10 days and the price has been pretty stable.
Affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, granulated, will definitely repurchase!
The paste contains granules, the refreshing feeling is just right, teeth feel smooth after use, much better than a certain second-hand east, they claim to import things, but many things do not have Chinese labels, I don't know where they wholesale from.
From now on, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to the second-hand east again.
Here's a suggestion, sometimes I can't post reviews on Amazon's app, I hope some improvements can be made to the application, it will get better and better!
Excellence has been getting worse over the years, there is no service quality to speak of!
The rubbish Excellence does not consider customer needs when placing orders, especially delivery time from 19:00 to 22:00.
Because there is an elderly person at home who is inconvenient to move around after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages at night.
As a result, they directly delivered at 12 noon without prior notice.
If the delivery time is whenever your courier wants, why bother to set a time for customers to choose?
If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then simply stop doing e-commerce!
Let an old man with three wounds on his body get out of bed to receive the courier and also find change to pay!
There is clearly a contact number on the order!
No one has ever called to give an explanation from beginning to end!
The so-called customer service for complaints on the Excellence website is just a bunch of outsiders pretending, dealing with your complaints and then giving you a so-called reply.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I've encountered similar problems with incorrect delivery times before and tolerated it, but this time it's unbearable, it's too much!
The new book I bought was delivered with the cover and back cover reversed, such a clear quality issue and they just closed their eyes and sent the book to the customer?
Leaving a negative review will not get anyone to contact you.
Excellence has been getting worse over the years, there is no service quality to speak of!
I will not spend a penny on Excellence again.
The quality of the images is simply unacceptable.
For a book titled "Ancient Map Collection", the choice, layout, and printing of the images are simply unacceptable, with some images even pixelated to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is small-format illustrations, it should do justice to the grandeur of the medieval documents left by our ancestors in the catalog!
(And many of the images can be obtained from related industry resources in clear original files), what's the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using images at all?
! I regret such an academic spirit.
I will not comment on the text, each family has its own discernment.
Overall 2 stars.
I read this book when I was in my second year of high school, just out of boredom, thinking that I wouldn't get addicted to such a book, after all, web novels from Qidian were not usually my cup of tea.
Then... I fell into the pit.
Following the plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the early part when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even if there were intrigues between guilds, it was not heavy because it was often made light-hearted by Ye.
As for the competition part, it wrote about the slight sadness of the changing times and the alternation of old and new (maybe I'm sentimental).
Reading the whole book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The Full-Time series' depiction of characters and emotional lines is very impressive. Some characters are only occasionally mentioned, but they leave a deep impression. Characters like Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng, who are more focused on, have a lot of fans, and characters not at the center of the writing like Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu are also very likable. In a refreshing e-sports novel, it's surprising that there isn't a character that is extremely annoying. This is a success of Full-Time in character depiction.
In terms of emotional lines, Full-Time doesn't have the common problem in web novels of having a harem of millions of beauties or rotten girls. All the characters' emotions have one thing in common: they all like the game Glory and most of them want to win honorably.
There are small plots but no big conspiracies, everyone seems so pure and cute.
This might also be why there are no annoying characters in Full-Time.
The IP of Full-Time is very big, which is also due to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of web novels, Full-Time is a good book.
It really provides some passion and a little bit of touching.
In April this year, Full-Time is going to be animated.
I've actually wanted to buy the whole set for a long time, but due to my always thin wallet, I never had the heart to do it. When I wanted to buy it, I found that there were a lot of fakes on Taobao. Actually, Full-Time recently released another version, I quite like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked on Amazon and bought a set all at once.
Next, I'll briefly talk about the condition of the books.
● The fourth book is not shrink-wrapped, but the book is new.
● The seventeenth book is shrink-wrapped but has been opened, and the texture of the book is strange, it doesn't feel as hard as the others.
● The 23rd book is the same as the 17th, but it's harder than the 17th, but very old.
● A few books are from different publishers, like the 23rd and 17th are from the same publisher, which is different from the others.
● Overall, I'm quite satisfied, 24 books in a big box, very satisfying.
The Lonely Little Lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but there's actually a lot of text!
I read it three times before I finished reading this book to the little ones, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat fruit juice gummies.
When I saw the plot of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a bit uncomfortable, modern city people can't quite accept such an arrangement of being eaten by animals.
In the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society, lost himself, he is no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human.
In the end, only the little lion's back is left, I don't know where he went.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion still remains in the impression of the grown-up children, and is remembered inadvertently one day, perhaps it will touch or inspire her.
High cost-performance portfolio
1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I bought a lot of their books, because they are too powerful, whether it's the choice of topics or the production itself.
This work has been released in 3 versions. The largest version is the same as the complete works of Michelangelo, both are close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and it comes with a box set of two books.
I personally think it's acceptable. Firstly, the price is cheap, and the 700+ pages are divided into two books, which are also easy to flip through as paperback; secondly, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, the paintings are the main part, and the black and white manuscripts of Da Vinci make up the majority. For readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, this version has the highest cost-performance ratio for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.
2. The commentary on the painting part is great, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper), but I don't know if it's a printing or book size issue, some shadow parts are too deep, and the details are not clear, which is a bit regrettable.
3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscript content is much richer.
The former is already a genius, and the latter's wide range of interests and high achievements cannot be described as genius.
If you could only experience half of Da Vinci by looking at his paintings before, you would be completely speechless after reading his manuscripts.
Trash, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give bad reviews, but this is genuinely trash, a waste of money. Give me a reason!
1. The time is inaccurate, it suddenly becomes January 1st, the time resets.
2. Inferior quality strap, it's not even silicone, wearing it causes wrist allergies and blisters.
3. Often can't connect to the phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection does not display, the time is 0.
6. It's not waterproof.
7. Other.
The logistics are too slow.
It showed that it would arrive on October 16th, but I didn't receive it until the 21st, bad review!
The delivery is too poor, buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfied
At first, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was okay, there was an air bag inside, the camera's three codes matched, and it could be registered on the official website, the shutter count was 0, the rest can only be tested over time.
The delivery speed is quite fast, here I want to complain about the courier, he just left the valuable item at the door and left quickly, I had no chance to open the box and check it in front of him, I'm speechless about this.
The seller has considered the customer before shipping :)
The seller is quite responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, truly considering the customer.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The screen protector fits well and is useful when applied.
The battery cannot be fully charged.
The machine is indeed good, I want to ask why it can't be fully charged the first time it is charged, the charging indicator light is always red.
Currently, I can't find an official feedback channel on Amazon, so I can only provide feedback in the product reviews.
1. On March 29, I pre-ordered this book for 31 yuan, it showed that it would be pushed to the device on March 31, at this time the book could not be previewed on the official Amazon website (because it had not been released yet);
2. The book pushed to the device on March 31 was blank, only saying "please look forward to it", and the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan;
3. I have tried repeatedly in the past two days to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and sync again, but I can't get the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" with actual content, but I see that the book can now be previewed on the official Amazon website.
I have a few thoughts at the moment
1. The issue of price is not the most important thing, the key is how to replace the blank book on the Kindle with a book with actual content, instead of always downloading "please look forward to it"
2. I probably won't buy pre-ordered books in the future, after all, if it's postponed, downloading another book with empty content seems very complicated;
3. I hope Amazon can provide a normal channel to feedback such issues, so that there is a place to feedback when there are doubts about the download or use of e-books (work orders, online customer service are all acceptable, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does it)
I don't highly recommend reading it.
I read it a long time ago, and just happened to see it, so I'll write some impressions from memory.
This book is less a collection of short stories than a collection of fragments about love in life.
The tone of this book is extremely plain, as plain as plain water. The choice of words and sentence construction pursue simplicity to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street on a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally collected together, it is titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love".
I think, this collection of short stories, and its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the eternal love in urban legends, nor just the inseparable intimacy between you and me. Love is not only the above but should not be represented by the above. Love is also a plain life like water, a boring day after day, and there is also a sense of helplessness in life, the escape from reality, and the confusion about the future.
When you read this book, you may recall the quarreling couple beside you, the tasteless marriage of people you know, and the unsatisfactory feelings.
This is exactly why I don't recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are tasteless, unless your life is stormy or sweet as if living in a candy castle, otherwise your feeling when reading it is that it's not surprising and boring.
And from the depth of thought, the daily plot does not enlighten or expand one's thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short fragments do not discuss any issues, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much difference whether you read it or not.
The author's ideas are more expressed through techniques and genres rather than story plots, which is also a reason why the reading experience of this book is relatively poor.
Suitable for skimming, not for detailed reading.
The logic of this book is good, but the content is not rich enough.
It explains a lot about what and why of sales theories, but it is weak in how to do it, only pointing out the direction but not giving specific methods.
Also, this book feels like it's pieced together.
Examples include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and unknown people.
I don't know if the stories were compiled just for the sake of examples, but it would be more convincing if the author cited cases he personally experienced.
The terms for customers keep changing.
The title is "customer", but in the text it becomes "client".
There are also problems with typos, missing punctuation, and numbering errors in the e-book.
In conclusion, this book is a good choice for beginners in theory, but not very suitable for those who are already in sales and want to improve their sales level.
A Quick Guide to Understanding Internet Finance
This book is quite basic, it can be said to be an introductory course, it can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of Internet finance, but to understand in depth, you still need to follow the clues and dig deeper on your own.
Moreover, the book was written quite early, and it does not mention the content of Alipay and WeChat cultivating user habits through the subsidy war. I'm afraid the share of third-party payments today is not as small as mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people just bring a mobile phone when they go out to eat, and merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank turnover.
But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience, is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write high and mighty, but it's hard to write in a way that's easy to understand.
I admire you, and I want you to know it!
The first factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough attention and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, once a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for most people, it's hard to express their feelings verbally, even if they are filled with love, gratitude, and appreciation, they keep it silently in their hearts.
The author elaborates on five languages of appreciation in this book: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, tangible gifts, and physical touch.
I think what's important is not knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to use these five languages from the heart to appreciate and be grateful for the people around you, whether they are family, friends, or colleagues.
In fact, the closer the relationship, the more appreciation and gratitude are needed, which will make our lives better.
Learning to appreciate can also help companies retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful thoughts and perspectives from abroad.
Due to differences in cultural backgrounds between the East and the West, there may be more or less differences between languages. If there is a chance to see the original version of the author, I believe there will be more gains.
Thanks again to the author, translator, and editors for their hard work!
Suspected to be counterfeit goods, please Amazon strictly review.
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it's even worse than roadside stall products, there is no gram weight, no barcode, ten bags of packaging are also loose, completely not the characteristics of qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, I have already applied for a return; it is entirely a quality issue; it is suggested that the seller should keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought Heart to Heart again, supermarket 23 yuan/10 rolls, added a few comparison photos, further verified the counterfeit of this product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further unhappiness!
Once again, I hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strictly control the source of goods.
A mediocre product, not up to expectations.
Pros:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Pros 2: The motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are okay to use, but they do not meet my expectations.
Cons:
1. There is no charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. I guess for customers who buy a 300 yuan product, in the eyes of PANASONIC, it's a handout, with no respect.
2. There is a strong strange smell when charging, even if it's only charging for 10 minutes, you can smell a strong burning plastic smell.
After testing it in the office for 1 day, the whole room was filled with this plastic smell.
Compared to the PHILIPS product of the same price range that I used before, although it has an extra blade, the quality of this PANASONIC product really lets consumers down.
Small Package
Upon receiving the express delivery and seeing the words "E-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It's much smaller than what I bought from the supermarket, it should be size M. The packaging is not the same as the picture on the product description, probably the so-called new version.
Three stars because I blame myself for not paying attention to the product specifications. I have no objections if you sell the M size e-commerce version, but what do you mean by delivering the wrong version?
E-commerce is full of tricks, it's better to go to the supermarket when you have time.
That's it.
Don't like the taste
The child really doesn't like the taste of the toothpaste, always saying it's spicy. Perhaps a different word would be more appropriate, but for now, this is the only word in the child's vocabulary.
Bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving a bad review. Four stars then, but I won't buy it again.
Genuine product, well packaged.
The packaging is very complete, with an air bag added inside, not just a bare product as some online reviews mentioned.
The bottle's outer packaging also has a layer of plastic film as described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the day after the order was placed.
It's a genuine product, just out of stock, not sure when it will be restocked.
A frustrating shopping experience
I placed an order during Black Friday, but after waiting for a long time, I still didn't receive it. Upon inquiry, I found out that the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues around me and they all said they didn't sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, I found out that the package was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transfers, I finally retrieved the package. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was still intact. I don't know if it has been used or not. Anyway, it was quite frustrating.
Incorrect Illustration
I thought I would receive headphones like those in Figure 1, but instead I received headphones like those in Figure 2. It's one thing for the item to not match the picture, but what does it mean when the sound in the left and right earpieces is not the same?
Although the names are the same, I still hope everyone can be careful. In addition, I would like to ask the person in charge at Amazon to replace the correct illustration as soon as possible. Thank you very much.
The operating system is mediocre.
After using it for a while, overall the display is okay, I don't feel much difference, it's just that this system is frustrating to look at. The boot time is noticeably slow, and it's impossible to set it up well. The included software doesn't even need to be mentioned, and the response speed is even more average. Compared to my colleague's, it's not on the same level.
The reviews say it has a very user-friendly design, but I can't find where it's user-friendly. The design of the commonly used up, down, left, right, and back buttons on the remote control is really not commendable.
So, just treat it as a TV, and use it with additional things like a TV box.
The price drop is too drastic.
The price drop is so drastic, from over a hundred to now 99!
I have accumulated many unrated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the review content.
If I use this paragraph to review, it means that this product scores at least 85 points or above.
For inferior products, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers can refer to it when purchasing, and the merchant will also improve the product quality accordingly.
Good quality at a low price, this is enough if you're not a fanatic!
Such an affordable cable, but it should meet the HDMI certification standards. After personal comparison, it easily outperforms domestic Akihabara stuff (which is twice as expensive). The cable is thick and relatively soft, no noise in 7-meter transmission. From now on, I'll stick with Baseus for affordable cables!
The product is okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, I found that I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order. The webpage always showed an error link when contacting the online customer service, so I couldn't get in touch.
When the goods arrived, the delivery person called me. I said I didn't want it and wanted to cancel the order but couldn't. The delivery person took it back and said he would sign for me first and let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once signed for. I had no choice but to call Amazon's customer service, and they said the same thing, that signed items cannot be returned.
I have bought items that cannot be returned according to policy from JD.com and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., and the customer service always allowed me to return them. Even when the diapers from JD.com had a strong smell after opening, the customer service still allowed me to return them. But with Amazon, it's not possible.
Rules are dead, people are alive, how do your customer service handle this?
They told me either I accept it myself, or let the delivery person buy it. The delivery person already has a hard job, why should I make him pay for something he didn't buy?
Fine, I won't return it, I'll accept it myself, but I must give your service a score of 1.
I advise everyone not to waste money.
Firstly, I bought it with great expectations, thinking that the Le brand wouldn't be too bad. After receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay, and the size was decent. However, one box was mostly soft, which you can't tell from the outside, you have to feel it. When eaten, it had no taste at all, bland and flavorless. When bitten into, the fruit flesh was a dark yellow, indicating it was bad. They mixed good and bad ones for sale, and less than a third were edible. I advise everyone not to buy it. It's not cheap, and the quality is too poor!
Once bitten, twice shy, I will never buy fruit from e-commerce again!
Where is the product's anti-counterfeit label?
The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which should have been caused by a strong impact. Looking at the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is distressing, especially since it's food packaging and it's too simple. Moreover, it's an international purchase, and I didn't see any obvious anti-counterfeit labels. Opening the bottle was very easy, and the key point is that a layer of honey directly came out from inside the cap. There was almost no stickiness when opened, is this how all foreign products are?
As a person born in China, I'm a bit confused.
It should be genuine, right?
Also, when I placed the order, it indicated that it would arrive around the 20th, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe all of this is normal?
The pick-up service needs improvement.
I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that one was missed and promised to be sent later. The second appointment happened to be on a rest day. Both the website and WeChat did not indicate that appointments need to be made on working days, causing unnecessary panic. I suggest improvements for the future.
Good Shopping
Positive reviews for the products!
I still trust the products from Amazon's own operations. Now it's very convenient to shop overseas. The logistics time from buying abroad is only a few days longer than domestic. I have to say that Amazon's ability to clear customs from overseas to domestic is very strong, much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought on overseas shopping.
I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are produced domestically, but it's cheaper to buy them after going abroad and coming back. I hope for improvements.
Trash
Seeing such a package, I ask everyone: Don't you think it's garbage on the side of the road?
A fragile plastic package, sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag, is this responsible packaging?
I think such packaging is like trash, buying this product, the packaging is extremely simple, there are no measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after receiving it, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.
If I just encountered one like this, I would accept it, but I bought several like this, contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return it, but I had to pay for the shipping, and then the shipping cost would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I would like to ask, I pay for the shipping with cash, and you give me a gift card in return, are you asking me to buy your gift cards directly? And I have to mail the product to the warehouse in Germany myself, isn't this a hardship for buying a product!
And I keep telling customer service, whose responsibility is it for such a problem to occur, but the customer service doesn't say a word about their responsibility, they don't even dare to take half of the responsibility, what kind of guarantee does such after-sales service have? In one word: Accept defeat! But I guess my review won't be given a chance to be published by Amazon, it will be deleted directly!
Quality is very good, 5 stars, but the logistics are very poor.
1, The quality is very good, it's a steal, the price is moderate, and it's worth more than it costs.
2, It's sturdy, made with ample materials, the welding points are solid, the surface treatment is appropriate, and the color is very good.
3, The logistics are a major flaw, I placed the order on the 3rd, and it arrived on the 11th.
4, If Amazon hadn't marked the estimated arrival time as February 7th, I might have been very satisfied.
5, But marking an expected arrival time is like making a promise to the user, and when that promise can't be fulfilled, it's hard for the user to take.
6, If you're not sure you can keep a promise, please don't make one.
7, In fact, I care a lot about the promises made by the seller.
8, So, I gave a low score.
The gold thread will fade in color.
The effect is there, but whether it's noticeable depends on the individual, or it could be a psychological effect.
One not so good point is the gold thread, which was originally designed to look good, but in reality, this gold thread will fade in color. If you move it a few times in the car, there will be some gold dust on your hands and in the car.
I hope the product can be improved.
This kind of square one, doesn't have much decorative effect, so don't put gold thread on it. It's troublesome when it falls off and dirties the car.
The items are intact, the speed is acceptable, divided into 2 packages with different packaging.
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it's just that the 2 items were divided into 2 packages, and the packaging is not the same. One is obviously over-protected, with thick cardboard attached, sealed with a layer of plastic, and the outer packaging is also easy to unpack. The other one is like a domestic express box, with a few air cushions put in, which feels a bit perfunctory.
The Eran mattress is genuinely good.
The 34CM mattress is unusually thick, you can sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is very good, whether it's the front or the back, it's quite soft, sleeping is very comfortable, and you fall asleep quickly when lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were some stains in two places due to violent transportation by the courier. Eran's customer service was very responsible and efficiently contacted to resolve the issue.
It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly marks it as self-operated, but it is actually delivered by the supplier, after-sales service is provided by the supplier, and if there are any problems, you have to contact the supplier yourself.
Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, cannot be cancelled; want to return or exchange, applied successfully on Amazon, sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier for returns.
What the hell is this self-operated product?
The product is not delivered by Amazon, Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales, the customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier", and still claims it is self-operated, too shameless, blatantly shameless, blatantly defrauding consumers!
Frustrating Experience
Previously, I bought a filter cartridge from another online store, and the filtration effect was good. Even if I used it for a day or two after the 28-day period, there was no scale.
Since the quality of the items I've always bought from Amazon has been good, I thought I'd buy from here this time. This is my first time buying a filter cartridge on Amazon, and the experience is not very good. Not only did scale start to appear early, but there was also floating small black carbon powder in the filter cartridge all the way to the 28th day. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. Very frustrating~
It's not as good as I imagined.
Compared with the power strips I've used before, the external workmanship is average, I haven't opened it to see the inside, but I hope it's as the shopkeeper described. From the perspective of ease of use, whether each independent unit is powered lacks display.
The packaging is damaged, waiting for time to test the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, the inner packaging box seems to be new, but the instruction manual does not seem to be new. I will be renovating in September, stockpiling goods, I hope it won't be bad by then. Please Amazon explain why several customers mentioned the damaged packaging, yet you can handle it calmly, thank you!
Overall not bad, there are some minor issues.
This is my first time buying a water filter jug. After reading several review articles, I felt that LAICA's cost performance was higher so I chose this one. After receiving the goods, I installed the filter according to the instructions and tried it out. Overall, it's not bad, but it seems that when pouring water, the raw water will mix with the treated water from the spout of the jug (the raw water compartment is not very tightly sealed).
When using it, you must wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!
The picture is incomplete.
The picture does not capture the details of the side, the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is the first point; this bead is produced in Thailand, the place of origin is not marked, this is the second point; the texture is not marked, this is the third point; when I bought it in the UK, each item clearly had its own box, here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there are no product marks on the bead, how can I judge whether it is real or fake.
Be careful when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon's customer service is really terrible.
Two days ago, I placed an order, and today when I received it, I found that the price had dropped by 40 yuan. I spent a lot of time finding customer service, and they said they couldn't make up the difference, but I could repurchase and return the goods.
This kind of customer experience and service is a million times worse than certain treasure and certain east.
It's okay, for a beginner, it's worth getting.
The quality is passable, it can't compare with the top-notch Transformers, I've seen the price in the mall before, at least several hundred less to say, this is my first time playing with Transformers, it's okay.
The stuff is good.
The stuff is really good, it's a gift for my girlfriend. Just that I had some unpleasant experience when the courier arrived at noon when I was not in Canada. The logistics company directly put the mail in the storage box and did not send me a verification message for pickup, causing me to make two trips.
But the item is indeed good.
Worth buying.
The little monkey is cute, Amazon offers a great discount, Chow Sang Sang's official website ships directly. I placed an order the night before yesterday, and received it this afternoon, so fast.
The postal courier is also very responsible.
Awesome!
A Customer's Confession
1 Upon receiving such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, they will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then when you contact the customer service staff in the meantime, they will tell you that a specialist will handle this issue and inform you of the result.
You can never actively contact this specialist, you don't know her employee number, there is no direct contact number, you just can't reach her, only she can contact you.
3 The tragedy is that after nearly 3 days, this specialist contacted me, but I was away from my phone for a while and did not receive her call.
I waited for 2 hours but did not receive a call from the specialist. During this time, I actively contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email asking her to call me back.
4 Nearly 3 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon's handling result will be for the defective coffee machine I received!
5 There is no problem with the products of Amazon USA, overseas shopping is a good way to shop, but it is far inferior compared to the service of Amazon USA.
6 For me, all I can do is continue to wait...
Uneven Bottom
Because the reviews said it was very good, I had high expectations for this pot. When I received it, I really liked it because it was lightweight. However, I found a problem when I started to use it. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it bulges in the middle and sinks around the edges, causing the oil to run to the sides. The large fatty meat I specifically bought to season the pot produced a lot of oil, but it couldn't cover the central area and got burnt. I couldn't even season the pot properly, let alone cook normally with this design.
I don't know if I was just unlucky to get a pot with an uneven bottom. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I decisively returned it.
I cleaned the pot thoroughly before returning it, wasting half a day for nothing.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve.
This is a product with a very simple design style.
In the shape of a cube, the designer has processed the top into a slight curve.
The lines should have been very smooth.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel, and the back is the water box cover.
The curvature of the cover and the control panel are surprisingly inconsistent, resulting in a height difference of about 2mm after assembly.
Although it looks like a very small gap.
But it can be said that it has destroyed the entire design sense.
I feel a bit sorry for the product designer.
It seems that Midea's product manager does not yet have the ability to create such a standard product.
(As for the feedback from the after-sales lady, of course, I can't ask too much, but when I heard the after-sales say that all individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought has a problem, her indifference and heavy burden of truth made me understand that I can't ask too much from Midea) On July 7, 2019, the water pump failed and the water output was small. This is the second repair, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
It's a great deal after the discount, but Amazon's fake discounts are disappointing.
Purchased a week after the baby was born, the insulation is super strong.
The outside of the pot doesn't feel hot at all, so it's not only safe from burns but also effectively keeps the temperature from dissipating.
After a night in an air-conditioned room, it can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said there was a big discount of 320 for the anniversary event, but later found out that everyone had 249, 289, 299, and instantly felt deceived. However, after comparing with the supermarket, it's still much more cost-effective than various off-brands at the same price, and it can be carried with the car when going out in the future.
Vitamix 6300
I've been watching it for a long time, saw the 6300 on sale on Amazon US, same price on Amazon China's overseas purchase, so I quickly placed an order.
I placed the order on September 2nd, the estimated arrival was the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days early, the speed is really fast!
The packaging box is not big, it directly uses Vitamix's original packaging, Amazon is not afraid of it getting damaged across the ocean!
The machine looks quite new, the accessories are complete, but the cup shakes a lot when placed on the base, I'm afraid the cup will fly out when I turn on the machine!
I asked a friend who has a 5200, from his description it seems like his doesn't shake as much as mine.
The included recipe book is all in English, it's quite tiring to read, I couldn't find a Chinese version online, this is a problem!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer, I guess it will arrive in 3 days, I'll mess around with it then!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
It's not large at all!
The second Totes, 1. This one doesn't have an umbrella cover 2. The handle material is average 3. It clearly says Large, but it's actually a convenient umbrella for one person, it would be a squeeze for two people.
On the contrary, the one I bought from Amazon US before can be used by three people without any pressure.
I'm not feeling too good about this.
Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms with a little pressure, secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS surface of the box from getting scratched when laid flat, thirdly, inside the box is just a piece of cloth with the handle area protruding.. and so on, various dissatisfactions. Lastly, the zipper is a bit unsmooth.
PS: The wheels do feel quite good.
It's okay.
Pros: This backpack is quite delicate and looks durable.
Cons: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what's going on), a 15.6-inch laptop can't fit in (can it be a bit longer), this backpack's zipper can be locked, but they don't provide a lock for the buyer, it can't be said to be customer-first service.
Overall it's okay, I'm not sure if it's real leather.
Overall it feels okay, I'm not sure if it's real leather, so I can't blindly comment.
It can hold A4 size documents, I've put in 80 pages thick, but I guess it can't fit too thick and hard box-shaped objects (that can't be deformed).
The bag is soft, the inside pockets are also quite humanized, it's pretty good.
It's just that the one I got has a small sand hole at the bottom, I don't know if it's my bad luck or what?
I'm too lazy to bother with returns, I'll put up with it.
Overall, I give it four stars, it's worth it.
ForRoyal Sweeping the Globe Camera Strap SLR Strap
This strap is designed scientifically, hung over both shoulders, practical, and the chest area uses soft material to secure and protect the camera, unlike other quick shooters that use screws to secure the bottom and damage the camera, and it is also very convenient to take off for photography.
Terrible After-sales Service
I bought a piano a month and a half ago, it was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me the after-sales service number. Despite multiple communications, I still haven't received the part. What kind of efficiency is this!
I guess it would be even more troublesome to repair it in the future. For those who expect good after-sales service, you might as well take a detour, it's too much trouble!
There are minor defects, but the sound quality is good.
The head of the piano has a defect, missing a corner, it feels like a defective product, and there are no gifts included. However, for this price, it's already quite good, and the sound quality of the piano is also good.
Alright, the first batch of face sheets.
I've used it for a long time, except for the bass not coming out, overall it's not bad.
It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as I imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the item, all the lights were flashing, and it couldn't be used.
I requested a replacement, but it's been three days since the goods arrived in Shanghai, and they still haven't been delivered.
The delivery person doesn't answer the phone.
The courier company said that's the only contact method they have.
I can't find a place to complain on Amazon.
Without any request, a text message came saying that the delivery was delayed as per my request - this is inexplicable.
Then they mentioned some issue with the transit.
Anyway, it's a very poor shopping experience, I'm starting to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I guess I won't be able to get it today either.
The label's adhesiveness is too poor, it's not waterproof.
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and there is no film on the surface; moreover, the label's adhesiveness is very poor, it's completely unsuitable for cable labels, it falls off very easily. Friends who bought it for cable management need to be aware of this.
The pen is okay, but the packaging is too simple, just a cardboard box, without any protective measures, and the box for the pen is stuck with a large piece of transparent tape, the tape remains on the box when torn off.
Such treatment for a six hundred yuan item, a very disappointing shopping experience.
But the pen has no problem.
I hope there will be more improvements in packaging in the future!
The quality is unquestionable, if it comes to writing, 925-25 is better.
First, let's praise the daily express delivery, air freight, super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25, it's very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is unquestionable, the style is also very beautiful, the reason for giving four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjustment lead length is a bit shaky, personal opinion: 925-25 is more handy than 85.
Therefore, I became a die-hard fan of Amazon.
I bought it at a super discounted price, but it turns out my child doesn't like the reading pen.
I've opened it, tried to apply for a return, and they even picked it up from my home for free.
That's awesome.
I don't advocate for returns, but this kind of service is unique in China.
I hope it won't be abused.
From now on, I will buy all my books here.
The headphones are biased in sound, and there is noise.
These headphones are really trash, I don't know if it's my ears that have a problem, or these headphones are indeed not as good as before.
I bought a blue one on a certain easy purchase two years ago, the sound quality was not bad, there was no noise, the bass was also good, I used it for more than two years and it broke, so I plan to buy another one (urbeats), after all, it feels pretty good.
I saw a purple one that looked pretty good, but when I bought it and opened it today, I felt something was wrong, one side was louder than the other.
At first, I thought it was because of the sound effects of that song and didn't think much about it, but after listening for a long time, I realized that this problem is very serious, not only is the sound biased, the bass effect is not as good as my previous one, and there is some noise, is it only the purple one I bought that has this phenomenon? Or is the current headphone manufacturing process really not up to par?
A very poor review, very disappointed.
I must return the goods during the day tomorrow.
PS The appearance is not bad.
This AV amplifier is complex to set up, roughly made, and generates a lot of heat.
The sound quality will be evaluated after some time of use!
I just got the German version of the DN1080 on August 14th. The exterior workmanship is so poor.
1. The front panel and knobs are all made of plastic.
2. The audio input jacks on the back panel and the speaker output terminals are so poor, any 1000-2000 CD amplifier integrated machine you pick at random would be much better than this one.
3. The top cover is quite thin, and the area around my transformer is even dented. I had to open the box and manually fix it, the top cover and the front panel are loosely connected.
4. The whole machine is heavy on the transformer side, which makes it awkward to move.
It feels like an entry-level machine from SONY, with that kind of workmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony would be much better off outsourcing to China than to Malaysia.
5. The machine generates a lot of heat, after watching a movie in two-channel stereo for about two hours, the top cover feels about 40-50℃ to the touch. I'm not sure if it's because the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switch power supplies are more commonly used, this stupidly large transformer probably weighs about 4KG.
Sony should use active cooling silent fans inside the machine, after opening the box, I only saw large aluminum heat sinks on the tubes.

Never been disassembled.
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what's inside.
But then I thought, if I'm disappointed after opening it, it would be a waste of money; if I'm satisfied after opening it, it would be hard to put it back together, and I wouldn't feel good using it.
Forget it, let's assume Sony uses good battery cells.
As for the detailed explanation of the battery life, most people would feel uneasy looking at it.
I'm fine, having worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I'm also half a battery engineer, I can handle it.
Overjoyed
I was really unsure before buying, but as soon as I opened it and saw the packaging, it felt right!
Finally, when I touched the headphone wire, it felt incredibly flexible, the quality was too good, I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was astonished, the sound quality was actually 3D surround!
I asked in a physical communication store, similar ones are around 30, but definitely not from the Pisen brand, they are off-brands, so although this Pisen is 27, it's absolutely worth owning in terms of cost performance!
The Worst Online Shopping Experience
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but I still hadn't received the goods by October 12.
When I checked the Amazon order status, the seller did not provide a tracking number, so I couldn't find where the order was.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide a tracking number, but I didn't get a reply for two days.
Out of desperation, I called Amazon customer service, who gave me the seller's phone number. After calling the store a few times, I finally got through and was told that the package was lost, but they could immediately send me another one.
Although I was very angry, I urgently needed the computer, so I didn't say much to the seller, as long as they sent it to me immediately.
However, when I called the next day to ask if it had been shipped,
the seller said it hadn't and that it could only be shipped in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller assured me that it would be shipped after five or six o'clock. But when I called at seven o'clock in the evening, no one answered the phone.
The next morning, I called again to ask if the goods had been shipped out
and if they could give me the order number.
The seller said it hadn't been shipped and suggested that if I was in a hurry, I should order from another store, but if I could wait, it would be shipped in the afternoon.
I had no choice but to wait a long time if I ordered from another store.
So I could only ask the seller to hurry up and ship the goods.
Finally, after countless phone follow-ups, I received the computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know because it was purchased for someone else. I'll add more comments later.
I just bought it half a year ago and haven't used it much, but now it's already having contact issues. Can I ask for it to be repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I didn't use it much after buying it.
I only packed it for use a few times when I was on a business trip.
Recently, I found that it doesn't charge when connected to the power source. I need to manually adjust the connection between the charger and the wire a few times before it can charge.
I suspect that the interface is having contact issues. I wonder if it can still be repaired now?
Strongly suggest Amazon stop using EMS!
Five stars for the product, one star for logistics, averaging three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon would use EMS, which is widely recognized as unreliable in the industry. After all, a computer is a valuable item!
After purchasing, the order showed an estimated delivery date of the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
From Xiamen to Fuzhou, why does it take four to five days!
On the morning of the 22nd, I checked the logistics and it finally arrived in Fuzhou. I was ready to happily receive the goods, but in the evening, without receiving any calls or text messages, I checked the logistics and it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I personally signed for it!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I seriously doubted my life!
In the end, I had to run to the collection point to bring the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier mixed up the two order numbers, but it's okay since the package wasn't lost.
I strongly suggest that Amazon stop using EMS. If Amazon uses EMS for delivery in the future, I will definitely not buy again.
The goods are not bad.
First of all, I found out that the price dropped just a few days after I bought it, which is disappointing. The product itself is quite good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen has a bit of light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not good (I suggest you spend some money to add a solid state drive). Yesterday I took it to the after-sales service for a hardware check, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Win8.1 is not very user-friendly, I suggest upgrading to 10. The seller shipped quickly and answered all inquiries quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer, which is good, but it's a pity that there were no gifts.
(By the way, if you want to buy a keyboard film, don't go to a shop called E Cool Digital Center on a certain treasure. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and they don't return or exchange defective products. The boss also swears a lot, I want to expose this specifically.)
The product is very good, but the platform bureaucracy remains.
The quality of the hard drive is excellent, and the cost performance is absolutely high. It's cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you're not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I definitely recommend purchasing it.
However, I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains the same as when I swore never to use it a few years ago. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information is always that it will be delivered a few weeks later, you can never complain, it's just so bureaucratic!
I received the goods a few days ago, but the logistics information still says you will receive the goods in about 10 days!
Logistics is not worry-free.
The delivery came in this condition, not only was the packaging crushed, the packaging of the electrical appliance was also open, I don't even know if there was a switch of goods.
FYI
Haven't tried it yet, always trust Philips, hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
I looked it up online, it might be a common problem of water ingress, and there is no warranty.
Frustrating!
Now I'm using it wrapped in cling film, I wonder how long it can last?
Bought something that has been opened by others.
The tax of over a hundred for a machine worth over three hundred is indeed high, but seeing it now at over six hundred makes me feel much more balanced.
When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened. I quickly took a picture, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening it, the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I hurriedly let my husband try it before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no power at all, luckily there was no stubble inside the blade, otherwise how would I return it from so far away!
Whether it's good to use or if there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown. As the previous reviews said, the items sent out when out of stock are indeed unreliable!
The experience is above average.
It's almost top-of-the-line electric, with many different tooth cleaning modes, but few people would change modes every day.
I've been using it for half a year without any problems, brushing every day, and charging about once a week.
Brush head accessories are just as cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, other than changing colors and such, it seems the compatibility issue is due to the overseas version?
Hope to learn from the greats.
The cost-performance ratio is very high.
I have used it 3-4 times already.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It's very easy to use, and also convenient to clean.
3. You can completely DIY your haircut, which saves money.
In conclusion, this was a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeits.
I bought two packs last time, and they turned out to be two different versions. Originally, the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but one of the packs was not, it had white words. As a result, my cat had diarrhea after eating it.
I can't determine whether the source of goods from Amazon is fake, or if the goods were switched by the staff during delivery.
I will buy it again, and if it is still counterfeit, I will hold your relevant personnel accountable.
It's a horizontal bar!
The picture on Amazon shows a slash, but what they sent me is a horizontal bar, isn't this deceiving?
The effect is okay.
The cat likes to eat, this is the key point.
It indeed works.
Tight, narrow, binding feet, rubbing the top of the foot.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, but it's a pity that this model is too bad.
Addendum: Today I compared it with the previous UN series shoe pads (I threw away the shoes but kept the pads), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it's just falsely soft.
2. My foot arch is not high, the part that rubs is about 3 centimeters forward from the highest point of the foot arch.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks overseas, only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the Clarks from my favorites.
I'll try Rockport next, if it doesn't work, I'll have to go to the ECCO physical store.
The quality control is poor, substituting inferior for good.
Firstly, it's worth acknowledging that Prime Overseas Purchase Ups is very efficient, I placed the order on the 31st and received it on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a little bit larger, with a foot length of 25 and a width of 10.5, I ordered 7.5W, it's a bit loose when worn, but I usually like to wear it a bit loose, it's just right with a pair of insoles.
Secondly, the quality control of these shoes is really disappointing, one shoe sole is damaged, the other shoe has various scratches and a pinhole, the glue strip at the connection between the shoe upper and the shoe sole is misplaced, it's obviously substituting inferior for good!
A bit regretful!
I bought it for 280 yuan during a promotion, which is quite a bargain for Asics at this price, of course, there are lower prices in the reviews.
Now let's talk about the shoes, pros: the shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well, they won't be loose.
They look great but the cons are also obvious: I usually wear size 40 shoes, this time I bought size 40.5, there's about a thumb's width of space in the front of the shoe, but this doesn't affect anything.
The shoes are quite "narrow", even though there's space in the front, they feel tight.
Another point, the shoes might not be very breathable, my feet feel hot wearing them now.
Pressing on the instep
First of all, the shoes are very well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, I have bought several pairs of Aibu from Amazon, and I have never had a problem with them not fitting, but this pair I referred to the comments, bought a larger size uk7, after putting them on because they are one size larger the length is obviously too long, but because the insole is too thick, it still presses hard on the instep, plus the walking shoes are very hard, making them very uncomfortable to wear.
If your feet are not particularly thin, I do not recommend buying this model.
If you must buy, changing the insole can solve the problem, but the original insole looks very high-end, it's a pity not to use it.
A perfect shopping experience!
Very satisfied, very fond of it, Amazon overseas purchases are undoubtedly genuine, the quality is also very good, good value for money, rest assured to buy, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and amiable, handling problems patiently and efficiently, perfectly solving worries, the accompanying express delivery to the door is very convenient and secure, the delivery master always thinks for the customers, always reminds to pick up from the express cabinet in time, thank Amazon for providing such a comfortable shopping experience to customers.
In short, our whole family likes shopping at Amazon overseas!
Absolutely negative review!
I'm speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Although it's been a long time, I still need to vent.
I bought it in a winter flash sale for less than 200, and it sat unused at home for several months.
When I wanted to use it in the spring, I found that it couldn't connect with the wristband no matter what. Both device manuals indicated they supported each other. Later, I found that the problem should be with the heart rate band, because it still couldn't connect with other devices.
I called Amazon, they told me to contact the agency. The agency asked me to send the device to Shanghai for inspection at my own expense.
Nearly half a month later, the item was returned to me in its original packaging, even the courier box was the one I used to send it!
There was no reply, receipt, or inspection report!
At least tell me whether it's good or bad!
When I called to ask, they said that if it was sent back like this, it means the device has no problem, it's good.
But why can't I still connect it? The agency's answer: that's not their problem anymore.
I'm just unlucky, I don't want to be bothered by you for a 200 yuan item.
The goods are seriously mismatched.
The goods are extremely mismatched.
The material of the headband is very good.
It's much better than Nike.
The breathability is also very good.
It's just that cap in front.
It's very thin.
Is it meant to be funny?!
It doesn't block the sunlight at all.
The reason for not returning it is because it functions well as a headband.
Although it doesn't block the sun when worn upwards.
But it's different from other headband styles.
I'll keep it for use.
The product quality is good, Amazon lacks a spirit of contract, the delivery person is very good.
I request delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon's rules do not allow delivery on Saturdays and Sundays.
It made me drive 200 kilometers from out of town to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person is very proactive and enthusiastic.
Give a thumbs up!
I tried the product briefly, it's not bad.
But I have never bought a similar product before, so I can't compare prices!
Size Logistics
The workmanship is okay, it's just that the logistics are too slow. The previous shoes were all DHL, this time Apex really... I've bought a lot of UA in China, the prices are not low, it feels like it's higher grade than NIKE ADIDAS?
Actually, they're all the same, so I shop overseas.
Size: I am 176CM tall, 68KG, my shoulders are wide and I usually wear 180, I bought M, the hem is slightly long, the rest fits well. I see some recommend size S, is their figure so slender? Or do they prefer tight-fitting? I think hoodies should be a bit loose.
The size is just right.
Chest circumference 99, height 184, weight 84 kilograms, before buying I consulted customer service and was told I should buy XXL, then I read the reviews and decisively bought L, after receiving it I found the size is just right, I almost got tricked.
The price on Singles Day is much more expensive than on Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The issue with Z's affordable goods is very troublesome!
I placed an order on the 18th, but didn't receive the goods until the 25th, it's like a snail's pace from Guangzhou to Beijing!
I bought Z's affordable goods, the description mentioned scratches, but after receiving the goods, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
My child didn't want to return the goods, thinking the problem wasn't big, but for such small parts, my child's grandfather couldn't find them in several nearby hardware stores!
In the end, the grandfather glued them on!
It seems that I can't buy Z's affordable goods in the future!
The quality of the toy processing is not good.
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, it's very hard to screw in the bolts, which shows the poor processing quality. I don't know how long it can be played with. Since it's something promised to the child, I won't return it.
Other reviews say that the installation is not strenuous, is it just the one I bought that has a problem?
Very average.
Is it because I'm unlucky?
The packaging is so old; the workmanship is very average; there is only one type of music and it's only 8 seconds long and then it repeats constantly; the action is just shaking its head and moving forward, with no variation.
It's not worth this price.
I need it urgently, so I won't return it.
The quality of the toy is good, but I have some complaints about the packaging.
I received the express delivery yesterday. It was purchased from Amazon and marked as shipped by EMS, but in the end, it was delivered by Tmall's express delivery. How many detours did it take? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?
Speaking of the packaging, it was just wrapped in a few layers of cling film, without any bubble wrap inside. When I opened it, all the parts were just lying in the empty box. Thankfully, the quality of the toy is good and there were no broken parts. However, it's much smaller than I imagined. Since it's not battery-operated, it often derails when pushed by hand. I feel that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, the design is unreasonable.
Good quality, fun.
Very fun, the components are highly precise, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is almost the same as Lego, the price is very favorable during activities.
The assembly process is quite interesting, I assemble, my 5-year-old son plays, it's pretty good.
He plays with continuous laughter~ Probably will continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The machine is new, overseas shopping is good.
I checked on Christmas, the one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the delivery is a bit slower now.
The machine is still good, all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then if you connect to the Poke Ball, you will get a Mew.
It's not bad to play, higher portability than PS4.
I have already bought Zelda, waiting for the game, try again.
Manufacturing junk, selling junk, resulting in junk service. I bought six watches to give to my children, one of which has an incomplete digital display. The time on all six watches is inconsistent, differing by several hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watches were checked for the correct time when they were stored. They replied "yes". If so, why is there such a big difference in time? It's clear that the watches are not accurate, simply put, they are inferior products. It's not that I'm being harsh, but look, they are selling products with obvious quality issues (incomplete digital display), aren't these junk?
I contacted the seller, and the seller gave a bunch of reasons, even complaining that I shouldn't have bought their products in the first place. With such products, such sellers, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future?
In short, I suggest not buying anything from this seller, because what you get is just junk.
Amazon Shipping Issue
Upon inspection after receiving the goods, it was found that:
1. The watch packaging is severely worn out.
2. The watch manual has serious usage creases.
3. The watch doesn't work, the desk lamp can't be charged either, and the time can't be adjusted.
4. Contacted Amazon customer service separately, can only ship to the United States at my own expense, and then reimburse the postage.
5. The reason for the 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.
I can only say it's passable.
The time is not very accurate, it's about one second faster every day, and it's already more than two minutes faster after only a few months of use.
I used to have a Citizen watch, and I feel it wouldn't be off by a few seconds even after one or two years.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the timer function is somewhat useless, basically not used, and occasionally it will accidentally enter the timer mode.
Solar Powered Sports Watch
Advantages: Solar charging eliminates the worry of battery replacement, features world time, multiple alarms, and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror surface is prone to scratches and dust ingress.
Cost-effectiveness: The general price in China ranges from 220-300, while overseas purchases cost around 180 (delivery time is about one week).
A very satisfying watch.
It's definitely genuine, I had it verified at the counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the craftsmanship is fine, the materials used are substantial, and it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It's incomparable to those so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred. This one is truly worth its price.
The watch keeps time very accurately, the error is completely within an acceptable range. There is a jewelry appraisal certificate in the watch's packaging, the 12 o'clock position on the dial is a real diamond. This is very suitable for me to wear, and it also looks good as a gift.
The Bentley watch is indeed good.
The worst shopping experience in history
On the evening of September 23, my wife's phone broke, and on a whim, I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock but not self-operated and there was no price increase (I was secretly pleased). Because it was not self-operated, the delivery was slow, and the system showed that the latest delivery would be on September 27.
My wife was very uncomfortable without a phone, so early the next morning at 6 o'clock, she asked me to think of a solution. I checked JD.com and saw that the 256G was in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.
After buying the new one, I thought about cancelling the Amazon order immediately.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to receive the courier in the early morning. I called customer service at 7 o'clock to request to cancel the order, and the customer service replied that it had been cancelled and to wait for a text message notification.
Well, I waited patiently. At noon, I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there and had not been shipped. I immediately contacted customer service to cancel the order quickly, and the customer service replied that the operation was OK.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again and clearly told them that this was my third call, please cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship!
At my request, the customer service contacted the seller on the spot and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would wait until they were familiar with the system to cancel the order.
But they clearly told me that the seller already knew and would definitely not ship, so I could rest assured.
When I checked the order on Monday, it had actually been shipped. I was speechless.
Since I couldn't contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.
The subsequent handling was simply speechless, basically, I had to say a step, and then the customer service would follow up.
The order is still in the state of parcel rejection and is preparing to deliver again!
Can't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
The seller's company has received the money anyway, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.
In summary, I will definitely not prepay for large items in the future, this is too troublesome.
It looks very nice.
I've had my eye on this camera for a long time, but for reasons other than the price, I didn't buy it. This time, because of free shipping, the price was also acceptable so I bought it.
After buying it, there were no other problems, but when connecting the software, I couldn't connect at all. My home uses a TP router. After searching online, I found that many people have this problem. I spent more than two hours changing various router settings. In the end, I used 360WIFI as a medium to fix it. During this time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions to this problem, they just told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another point worth noting is that I saw user comments online saying that the smallest storage card this camera supports is 8G. It can't recognize storage with smaller capacity, so please pay attention to this.
It feels okay to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, the machine has a certain degree of heat. If it's always on, this level of heat is a bit hard to accept.
In summary, this product has many shortcomings, so please be careful when buying.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because this was bought with my first love in life. We were together for almost 3 years, and then she left me last year, up until now.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because this was bought with my first love in life. I don't know to what extent it's being used now, maybe it's been thrown away!
We were together for almost 3 years, and then she left me last year. Every time I think of her now, I feel so heartbroken that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life, she left me with a lifetime of shadows and heartache, and I still haven't been able to move on.
When I bought this phone, I thought about the feelings we had at the time, we could share weal and woe together, but now I can't bear to look back. Maybe that's life, there are some people you don't want to meet in your lifetime, some things you don't want to know in your lifetime, but what can you do?
How many times when I see this Samsung phone, I think of her, and the pain comes flooding in. I've never been willing to use a phone that costs more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate. No matter how good you are to someone, when the day comes that they change their heart, all the vows of love will vanish into thin air.
Quality Goods Among Domestic Brands
Huawei is a quality product among domestic goods.
The low-key boss and company win customers by relying on technology and quality, which is completely different from the current business atmosphere of improving visibility through advertising operations!
Companies without strength can't do this at all, and they dare not do it!
It is for this reason that I chose Huawei.
I've been using it for more than half a year, and it feels very good, very nice.
The reason why I didn't give full marks is because there was a time when it was not positioning while using its offline navigation. I didn't find out the reason in the end, but it's very good at other times.
Moreover, after you input the destination online, it automatically designs the route after searching. After leaving the wifi and setting off, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical. You don't need to use data, it directly communicates with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, which is very good!
Sony is great.
This low-end model from Sony still has a full sense of design, and it's cheap, with a large screen, excellent battery life, and is very suitable for the elderly to use.
Although a lot of time has passed, this machine still has no problems.
However, because my Z2 has been demoted, this phone has also completed its mission.
