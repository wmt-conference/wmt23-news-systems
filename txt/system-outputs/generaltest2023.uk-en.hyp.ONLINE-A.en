And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
‚ÄîLetter from the Occupancy.
Kherson.
"Natasha, we are holding on with all our might.
It feels like they're afraid.
They are very afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat several times that they are great, that they are strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and in my head it spins - how afraid are you, s@ki, if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat this greatness.
As you yourself are not sure of yourself.
It's like sexual intercourse with an impotent person who needs to repeat endlessly that he is strong, that he succeeds, try very long and stubbornly for him and at the same time think when this painful bullying will finally end.
We repeat this in order to save us all.
Because it is very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless body with a machine gun.
Because then, when this evil spirits are expelled from our land, we will need to put the city in order.
Whoever we talk to now, everyone has the same words.
Words that the smell of rot in the city.
We will probably need a lot of detergent just to wash sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time, because everything these inhumans touched has the smell of rot.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were big.
Three healthy men stripped her naked and left her outside, forbidding anyone to approach her to help.
For three hours she stood naked in the street and only spoke loudly:
"Don't come near me, my dear.
Don't put yourself in danger.
Please!
We will still have a lot to do with you...
Then!
And further.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It's even hard for me to imagine that they don't steal.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting from children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because leaflets are constantly put up in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
And when they are close, Kherson residents will deal with dishonesty with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they are in a hurry.
And we will wait.
Let's wait.
We grit our teeth, clench our fists until numb in our fingers and wait.
Because we have something to wait for.
To be once and for all.
And none of this evil spirits remained.
And then we will wash the city.
Long.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
The author of the written for obvious reasons is not indicated.
And I need communication. Absolutely something I'm sour. I know that few people want to communicate with acidic people, but still I do not lose hope
How satisfied are you with your accommodation?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same profession as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar questions are now reflected by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs within the framework of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The conclusions will help to better know their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
Everyone who provided a functional e-mail when requesting humanitarian assistance receives an invitation to research (from the invitation address@click4survey.cz).
The questionnaire is filled in by each only once!
Filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
PRODUCTION TECHNICIAN
,PRODUCTION MECHANIC
We manufacture electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics or modern medicines ‚Äì none of this would have happened without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues in our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities to both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I would like to say a few words about this.
There is a great desire to gather with residents to discuss important, exciting issues, but the gathering is prohibited by law, because there is a war in the country.
I would be grateful for good advice and any help in my desire to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are a force.
Together we will overcome all adversity.
Together we will win.
So get in touch.
I will listen to everyone.
I will be infinitely glad and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the conditions for the payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all arriving Ukrainian refugees are eligible for first aid in the amount of 5,000 CZK without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
In order to receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation ‚Äì to be considered unemployed, not to have property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The first benefit payment will cease to be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily multiple meals and hygiene supplies, he will not be able to claim a payment of 5,000 CZK.
The authorities will begin to believe that basic assistance was provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and there is no need to pay money.
This event is designed to solve the problem of Roma refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for financial assistance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The right to cash payments of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth benefits will still be available only to those refugees who prove an immediate need (lack of work, etc.).
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå As in the first paragraph, only those Ukrainians who were not provided with free housing, daily multiple meals and hygiene utensils will be able to receive financial assistance;
üìå the applicant must actually reside in the territory of the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of "tourism for help", when a refugee lives in one country, and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days only for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address in the application form does not coincide with the address indicated in the database of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she really lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the payment of benefits will be refused.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent on the payment of humanitarian aid 2.626 billion. CZK.
And today I was engaged all day trenching defensive structures, yes, and the whole city is trenching, something not very happy forecasts for the near future.
Honestly, I am tired, it is very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, for this we need someone to organize equipment and people, and I am the village headman, then these are my duties
All utilities are involved, and we also appeal to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We must unite, otherwise we will not defeat the catsaps
A lot of propaganda for people to despair and weaken resistance
Honestly, I haven't picked up a shovel today, I hope I don't have to
The children stuck girls' stickers on my phone case so that I would not forget that I was feminine
What happens if the bill passes?
‚òòÔ∏è A Government Commission will be formed consisting of representatives of the Office of the President, some ministries and business associations that will accelerate the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
‚òòÔ∏è The NSSMC and other executive authorities will review all business permits in most areas by the end of the year.
And they will suggest which of the permits or procedures need to be removed.
‚òòÔ∏è The Cabinet of Ministers will remove all "unnecessary" permits and procedures in an expedited mode.
Without any public discussion, behind the scenes!
‚òòÔ∏è It will not matter whether the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers contradict current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of economic activities that may harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
‚òòÔ∏è Business regulation by the state will be based on the principle "one new permit ‚Äì minus two old ones".
Whether or not it makes any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
‚òòÔ∏è Behind the scenes, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents on permits or procedures in the field of environment.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, and more will be at risk!
‚òòÔ∏è Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We will not even know how and who changes the bylaws, until the final decisions are made.
‚òòÔ∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the possibility of influence are business associations.
Bill No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Tight deadlines for reviewing permits, non-transparent procedure, lack of any decision-making criteria ‚Äì this is a movement somewhere to the east, not to the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the appeal
They told her ‚Äì babo, the Russians approached the village; Grab your cat and climb into the bus.
She refused ‚Äì sho me, an old mare... Save children and girls, I'm going to fight here... Baba goes down to the cellar, owls cucumbers, rolls back a tub of rubbish, a bunch of troughs; There are doors ‚Äì iron owls and silver locks.
And behind the door, someone rattles with chains.
I didn't think, says Baba, that I would live.
Seventy-odd years ‚Äì and again twigs.
Go ‚Äì just not through the gardens, for I will curse, You will bring us closer "Putin kaput".
The cat is hissing, glass cracks in the windows.
Tanks rumble and rush between houses.
Russians enter the village.
Out of the cellar comes a dog with three heads.
Hello, go to the post office and confirm your identity through the "check-in", then upon confirmation you will be given a code, and this code must again be indicated in registration on the Internet and you are ready.
There must be a bank card registered to the person who wants to receive financial assistance, the other is not suitable.
I did the same: an acquaintance told me that some key was needed, but when she survived, she waited for the government, where she was told why she came, since she was already registered.
She also showed in this application that some kind of key was needed, but in fact it was already registering without that
Help me, the application was issued online on May 5, but something is not fashionable to understand whether to go to the labor government or wait
It is written that you will receive money on the card after processing your application, but writes that the identity is not confirmed, through the bank system gives an error
Good afternoon, dear Mrs. Angelina!
I want to express my point of view regarding the use of "in" / "on" in relation to the word "Ukraine".
The use of the term has become a serious political issue in recent decades.
Today's war of Russia against Ukraine was prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy
Thank you for interesting exercises and tasks, for a clear explanation of grammar, pleasant communication.
We are especially grateful for the technical support of training, first of all, for the textbook, which allowed us to understand what was sometimes not learned at the lecture.
These three months laid the foundation of our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish the whole creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions, he popularizes world classics in Ukrainian, among them "Lolita" (V. Nabokov), "Perfumer" (P. Suskind), "Sin" M. Kotsyubynsky, "Letter from a Stranger" and "Wild" by S. Zweig, etc. (etc.).
The works that he incenses are not easy to understand, need to invest soul and heart.
The author deliberately leads viewers to deep feelings and tears.
In his opinion, tears are purification, this is the path to the recovery of modern man.
It has a number of awards.
In 2005, he received the title of "People's Artist of Ukraine", Laureate of the National Prize of Ukraine. Taras Shevchenko (2007), but most of all Mr. Mykhailo appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate.
Connoisseurs of Mr. Mykhailo's talent hope that at the end of the war they will hear him play the saxophone again, see his unsurpassed ability of transformation, will be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art
Minerals of Ukraine
By origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Therefore, their placement is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
The fuel minerals mined in our country include: coal and lignite, oil, natural gas, peat, oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully meets its own needs for coal and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we have a rational economy, an acute shortage can arise in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissya.
Since the mid-1990s. It was used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, farming, glass, porcelain, faience, food industries.
Various chemicals are also obtained from peat, in particular acetone, phenols, paraffin, fodder, yeast.
Considerable deposits of shale oil are in Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions.
The geography of distribution of fuel resources is associated with the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, therefore they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as in the marginal foothill troughs.
Coal.
94.3% of our country's coal deposits are coal.
Ukrainian coal is of high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine, there are deposits of the best grade of coal ‚Äî anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of coal is coking.
After special processing, it is used in the smelting of iron and steel.
According to proven reserves of coal, Ukraine ranks VIII in the world and I place in Europe, and in terms of production ‚Äî respectively XI and III place.
Proven coal reserves in Ukraine are about 50 billion tons.
The forecast reserves are about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write "messages" on shells that are dropped on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
Thus, Ukrainian the band Kalush Orchestra called from the stage of Eurovision to save the military blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol ‚Äì and the very next day the Russians wrote on the shells "Kalush, as you asked! #–Ω–∞ Azovstal".
The missiles that the Russian military used to shell the train station in Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022, read "For the Children."
Then 61 people died from shells with a cynical inscription, including 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared in the First World War.
In World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to enemies.
Then it helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on the shells by the Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they do not like Ukraine's political course.
Russia needs to be stopped so that such "messages" do not fly to any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing greeted us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
"We carry insulin, it needs a temperature regime ‚Äì it cannot heat up.
Is it possible to pass control in an expedited mode?"
The border guard allowed us to stand at the beginning of the queue, even the trucks gave way affably.
Lviv
The city of Lion lives.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body ‚Äì an endless stream of people.
People from all regions of the country have found shelter and a sense of security here.
Someone goes further to Europe, someone returns home, someone stays.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the dictated windows of cathedrals.
It envelops monuments and sculptures in white canvases.
But the war cannot be heard on Rynok Square, where thousands of voices are heard at the same time, it cannot be heard in cafes and bars where people continue to live.
Yes, life subsides earlier ‚Äì at 11 pm life hides from curfew.
But it is: when we were sitting in a caf√© at 9 pm and announced the alarm, we could only hear it from a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpin
We paved the way to Kyiv through two of the many martyr cities ‚Äì through Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities where the air smells of hope.
Despite the pain, people return and rebuild their lives.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Shell remnants or machine gun bursts?..)
On the crushed balcony, Ukrainian banner was stretched.
There are holes near the front door, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And at that front door, three are rummaging.
They clean, repair, build a wall and with it a new life.
And two blocks below a mother walks in the park with a child.
I can't help but ask myself: "Did their dad survive the shooting of men in Bucha?
Will he walk with them again?"
On the outskirts of Irpin there is a cemetery of cars.
These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and which were ruthlessly shot by the Russian occupiers.
This cemetery has already become the object of a kind of "patriotic tourism".
If you go deep and stand surrounded by autoskeletons, you can feel a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow air, it seems that it can be cut with a knife.
And it's been weeks since the death of passengers...
If you look through the holes in the hulls of cars, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.
And in one of the cars there is an abandoned bicycle, in the other ‚Äì a warm children's jumpsuit.
Somewhere the booklet with instructions for using the airbag was unburned.
Remnants of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
We drive on, look back at the city one last time ‚Äì and come across the same bridge under which frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, but it was on these broken stones that Ukrainian military carried a baby in white.
This kid in a white jumpsuit probably survived.
But is there a chance that a child who wore clothes abandoned in one of the cars is also alive?
On a ragged bridge sits a man, a camera over his shoulder.
Just sitting and looking at the abyss between Kyiv and Bucha.
He does not take pictures, but only looks.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge, and thinks: how is it?
"Happy holiday!" the man exclaims to us happily. ‚Äì "Happy City Day!"
On May 29, the military Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Mykolaiv
Hero city, outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A front-line city that the occupiers still cannot capture.
And we believe that they will not capture it ‚Äì the city is fighting and living.
At the corner of streets, at every second intersection, there are neatly stacked tires and Bandera lanes.
Evening Mykolaiv is now incredibly quiet ‚Äì the noise against which the city lived has subsided.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And at night it is extremely dark.
Light masking for safety.
People live "by candlelight", more precisely, with flashlights of mobile phones.
At home, we only turn on the lights in the kitchen ‚Äì quickly and when necessary.
My grandmother hung the windows with heavy blankets through which light does not penetrate.
There is a hunting rifle next to my sister's child's bed.
"At hand since the 24th," says the father.
With air raid alarms and sounds of explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in the frontline city, it is very difficult to live in a mode of constant alarms.
When then to live?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers from the city, shots from "peonies" reach the Zhovtnevyi district, covering Kulbakyne.
Several times flies close to my family.
To the next block, across the street from us.
The grandmother's neighbors took out the windows, the children took them to their place, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of the Ingul and Central districts.
Life goes on.
A siren is howling on the central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple is sitting on a bench, talking about something, calmly discussing it.
A cyclist passes by them.
We review with dad ‚Äì what will we do?
"Well... Shall we have coffee?"
So we sit on Soborna Street (former Soviet, by the way) in the public garden near the monument to St. Nicholas.
What else to do?
To be honest, when the siren takes you by surprise on the street, there is often nowhere to hide, no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every citizen of Mykolaiv.
On the lawn at the entrance lies a huge trident ‚Äì once decorated by the Regional State Administration.
Now on the place where the trident flaunted, there is an empty "nothing".
As well as on the site of the office of the head of the Regional State Administration and a dozen offices around.
The rocket landed clearly on Kim's desk.
The war takes on a completely different shape when it is not in the news, but under your feet.
I walk along the corridors of the Regional State Administration, and with each step I hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor ‚Äì someone filed requests and applications, but now it does not matter.
On the table of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag.
There is a flower on the bedside table.
They took her home, transplanted her, even if she lived.
We met a guard who was at the post on March 29.
Survived.
"They shook it, they sewed it up," he points to his head. "Already at work."
Only journalists can get into the Regional State Administration.
Together with us are a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, live inclusions, interviews.
According to official data ‚Äì 36 dead.
This is "September 11 in Mykolaiv", "a monument to the Russian world", comments the press attach√© of the regional head.
The Mykolaiv Regional State Administration is just one of the wounds on Mykolaiv's body.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even when Denmark helps to restore the Regional State Administration, Mykolaiv residents will always see a terrible emptiness in it.
Russia has started a new "gas war".
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in Russia's war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, Russia has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transmission system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, in May ‚Äì to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream pipeline.
Official Berlin expects Russia to cut off natural gas supplies by this route as early as July.
Russia used such blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians within two days.
Gas has always been for Russia not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political issues.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the priority is the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West.
Financing of the Russian economy is donations for the Third World War.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent from Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and trying to quickly diversify gas and oil supplies.
But in order to become energy independent of Russian energy, the EU needs time.
Meanwhile, Putin's regime is intimidating Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and lack of heating in homes.
European countries, especially dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may experience its shortage.
But this crisis will stimulate a more economical attitude to natural resources and increase energy efficiency.
Europe will benefit when it abandons Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as geopolitical weapons.
The temporary discomfort is worth enduring so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia is burning crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary shells that destroy ripe crops of grain and oilseeds.
In doing so, Russia is causing the spread of world hunger.
Because of Russia's war, the number of people in the world suffering from food insecurity could rise by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, Russians are stealing already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroying agricultural infrastructure, blocking sea exports.
The destruction of Ukraine's agrarian potential is another manifestation of Russia's military aggression.
In this way, Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world economy.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital Transformation is launching an innovative hotline format - the virtual center Diia.Business.
Internally displaced persons from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registering their own stay, registering a business, finding employment and receiving assistance.
Therefore, the virtual center Diia.Business is being launched in order to provide all the necessary answers remotely until Ukrainians can return home.
It is scary how to be afraid of every important day, and more than ever you know a day or minute what may come
Good afternoon, Anna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician back and ask when the next time you can come for vaccination for Darusia.
It was supposed to be tomorrow, I can't come, because I need to replace the battery in the car, it will be by the end of the week.
A neighbor brought a cable and we charged it from Marina's car.
But on the panel of the car writes, you need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia has to bring it from Ukraine, and here it will be replaced for me
Tomorrow I will try to start the car, if it works, we will go by ourselves, I will leave my grandmother in the car and will not turn off the engine.
If I do not start, then I will write to you and you will come for us
I am very uncomfortable bothering you, distracting you from work.
Okay, we'll go with you at 11:45 a.m. so as not to risk it.
"The war is not over yet, and the fate of our new neighbors is also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escaping to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure journey they embark on together to put them in hastily loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all adults who still do not quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
Stories of children for whom the only memory of home is a toy that they could cling to during many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, the organizers emphasize.
At the end of each trip ‚Äì a return to a safe home.
But this trip is different, scarier.
This trip did not end even after more than eight months.
Homecoming is expected.
The theme of war is omnipresent, so our walk may seem superfluous.
On the contrary, in the face of growing antipathies and hostilities in society, which are fueled and exploited by the populists, we want to point out that involuntary travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in a poetic form and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
Now they are part of it."
Despite such a painful theme, the parade still managed to make it bright and encouraging.
Masters and craftswomen had a hand in this, who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, rags, houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade ran from Campa to Wenceslas, and at each stop there was a huge performance, the dramaturgy of which was developed by Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to preserve the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what they are facing Ukrainians now," says the playwright. - Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects normal life, which is interrupted by an air attack.
Glowing birds are the first to come to the rescue - they close their wings first of all, children.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of wings protecting becomes even more actual.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song spreads in a column.
And all creatures came back to life: sunflowers, rags, toys, and even houses.
Such symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who helped and are helping Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we will be able to overcome this difficult path and security will reign in our homes."
The wife sends her husband to the market for snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, a man meets friends and gets into a binge for three days, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
Thinks to tell his wife why he's been gone for so long.
He rings the doorbell, pours the snails on the floor, the wife opens it, he, driving them with his hands, says:
‚Äî Well, here we come!
We go in, we go in, we go in...
Our editorial office talked to Ukrainian refugee Marina, who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.
"Now I am trying to realize myself as an artist," said the Ukrainian.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, worries about relatives.
In a conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, there is confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she found herself with her children.
But the woman believes in herself and tries to adapt to life in Prague, without leaving the thought of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Maryna is from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children ‚Äì a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect in the State Nikopol Institution.
"I am an architect of buildings and structures by education, graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with honors.
Before that, I studied at an art school, graduated from the lyceum with a degree in graphic artist," said Marina.
And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Maryna left Ukraine with her children without hesitation.
Prague became a refuge for women.
"Of course, a new city, big, crowded... A new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs say to me.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
In addition, I do not hesitate to seek help from the Czechs and have never felt any aggression from them.
I thank them for this," Maryna shared.
According to her, in solving issues related to finding housing, obtaining visas and insurance, applying for benefits, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the kindergarten
Having received a tolerated stay visa, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
"Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they shrug their shoulders...", she said.
"They didn't take us to kindergarten because there are no places.
They say that it is necessary to look for adaptation groups for children, and nobody knows exactly where they are.
I met a girl who speaks good Czech.
She wanted to help me find a place in the kindergarten for children, calling a number of different authorities, but...", continues Marina.
"In general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and naughty.
I can't say that children bother me, but if they went to kindergarten, I could safely attend Czech language courses.
Once I went with the little ones to Czech classes, so they played a little, and then began to behave restlessly.
I, like a normal mother, was distracted, could not study normally... If there were language courses for adults with children or with young children, someone was during training... But my daughter is so attached to me," the woman sighs.
"Of course, together with our children, we go to various free events created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which we are very grateful to the Czech Republic," Maryna added.
When children sleep, Maryna is engaged in self-education, learns Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
Once Marina was looking through vacancies on the Internet and saw an ad: "Within the framework of the initiative of the Association "Spolek Zaedno" with the support of the EC Representative Office in the Czech Republic "12 stars for Ukraine", we are organizing a one-day art workshop at the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.
All that is required of participants is creative imagination..."
Marina could not help but take this opportunity.
"I plucked up the courage and applied for participation.
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we painted all day.
Before that, I had not slept, I was worried.
Besides, I didn't pick up a brush for six years," the Ukrainian said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, among which 12 paintings are works by Ukrainian artists.
"The subject of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use the Ukrainian theme in our works ‚Äì we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.
Therefore, blue and yellow colors prevail in the collection of paintings," added Marina.
The event was attended by 30 applicants, of whom only 12 were chosen.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings will be held in Prague with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic.
"That's how life happens.
All your once acquired knowledge and skills can be useful, and even support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," said Marina.
"And now I'm trying to realize myself as an artist.
Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
But we need to do something...", the woman said.
Maryna thanks the Czech Republic for hospitality and hospitality, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.
Active hostilities continue in southern Ukraine.
Residents of temporarily occupied and frontline settlements continue to leave for safer territories.
On September 1, the academic year began in Ukraine.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will need a lot of time to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia started.
However, Ukrainians do not wait for better times, but have already begun to clear their cities and villages from Russian garbage, rebuilding infrastructure.
The Kyiv region took the blow in the first days of a full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital in a few days and capture it.
These towns and villages survived active hostilities, atrocities of the Russian army, and sometimes occupation.
In early April, the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksandr Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after the active hostilities and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public space.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia began a new stage of this war ‚Äì informational.
Russia is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce international support for Ukraine.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine fight the aggressor, and thus become accomplices in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report that the Ukrainian military are setting up positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure.
At the same time, she ignored the fact that we are talking only about objects from where the civilian population has been completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to information attacks of the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia attacked Ukraine, seizes its territories, kills and tortures civilians, destroys cities and villages.
Russia is guilty of the war, it has no right to any actions on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and dislodge the enemy from the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine withstand Russia on all fronts!
I'm sure every person in the world has ever dreamed of their perfect home.
Believe me or not, I'm no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.

The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with bedside tables and chests of drawers.
There will be many interesting books in bookcases in the office.
The living room will become the most visited place in the house, where the whole family could get together, share news or just have fun.
That's why there would be a large sofa with small cushions, several armchairs, a chest of drawers, a huge TV, and a long built-in aquarium.
Also, my ideal home would have an attic where we can make a home theater or entertainment room.
Behind my house would be a pool with a few hammocks.
We would also have a sports center where we could do exercises every day to keep fit or simply practice different team sports such as volleyball, basketball, football, etc.
My ideal home would be big and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I would love living in it.
But that's just my dream... I have to implement it.
Hello,and how many people should there be,so that I know,what room to cook?Or is she alone?

My whole body is sick, I don't feel anything good at all, that although I can walk with me, there has never been such a thing

How football teams from Ukraine and Russia fought in Turkey

FC Minaj claims that this is a fresh photo from the last training session after a fight with the Russians
In Turkish Antalya at the training camp there was a conflict between the players of the Ukrainian football club "Mynay" from the Premier League and the Russian "Shinnik".
The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams accidentally settled.
Initially, Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict that took place on February 13.
The fight was then confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC Minaj, the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
Allegedly, one of them was drunk and clinging to a hotel employee, and Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight did take place, but already on the floor where the Russians stayed, and in equal warehouses.
The number of victims on the part of "Shinnik" only confirms the fact that the Russians are also "abandoning" their own," the statement said.
The club claims that after the end of the fight, the Russians continued the fight among themselves, the local police had to intervene.
"Before the start of the training camp, the main requirement of FC Minaj to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to settle Shinnik," the statement said.
Football journalist Roman Bebekh, who was one of the first on Twitter to report on the situation, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player defending an employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that they provoked a conflict Ukrainians.
In particular, the Baza Telegram channel writes that representatives of "Minai" approached the players of Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and demanded to sing Ukrainian anthem.
Ukrainians denied this.
"The numerical advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our boyfriend.
Yaroslavl residents stood up for him and defended him.
There were five or six of us, there are much more Ukrainians," a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, among the injuries - a dissection of the lip, a broken toe on the toe and a suspicion of bruised ribs," Kommersant writes.
"I don't understand where the hotel could have come from Ukrainians, because when we booked a hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine," Shinnik CEO Sergey Kulakov said indignantly in a comment to journalists.
Kulakov later told Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but stressed that they were not being evicted, they decided to leave on their own.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what does medicine for diabetics have to do with it
7 minute(s) ago
Gaining popularity injections help to lose up to 15% of weight, but have many side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell weight loss injections Wegovy, which are used by some famous people, in particular, Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in type II diabetes.
Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience on social networks, admitted to its use.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other drugs for the treatment of type II diabetes can actually contribute to weight loss.
Acting on specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, a person is less likely to feel hunger, saturate faster and consume fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick solution and not a miracle cure that helps you lose weight without any effort.
Treatment takes place under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and physical activity.
Like any medication, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or indigestion, bloating and gas.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to loss of fat on the face, and in some people, to recession of the cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
This effect doctors called "face Ozempik", from the name of another drug for the treatment of diabetes, which is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors advise taking Wegovy no more than two years.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine regained some lost positions

In some sectors of the front, the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to restore previously lost positions and gain a foothold there.
This was stated by Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi during a conversation with Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhnyi, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk sector, where Russians carry out up to 50 attacks daily.
Fierce fighting continues in the area of Vuhledar and Mariinka, where, according to Zaluzhnyi, the Ukrainian Armed Forces are reliably holding the defense.
"Despite the constant pressure of the enemy, we continue to control Bakhmut and take measures to stabilize the front line around this city," Zaluzhnyi said.
In a conversation with General Milli, Zaluzhnyi shared his concern over Russia's use of sea surface drones, which poses a threat to civilian shipping in the Black Sea.
After capturing Soledar, Russian troops continue to tighten the ring around Bakhmut.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut for his troops was "developing successfully."
On February 11, the evening summary of the General Staff stated that Russia was strengthening its grouping of troops in the Liman and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and the night of February 11, Russians attacked Ukraine's critical infrastructure in several regions.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from six o'clock on Friday evening until midnight, Ukrainian air defenses destroyed two dozen "shaheds" that the Russians launched from the east coast of the Sea of Azov.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile strike on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

EU to tighten sanctions on Russia on anniversary of invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
On the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, the European Union will impose new sanctions on the Russian Federation.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (Olaf Scholz), speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of an emergency EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU would support Ukraine "for as long as it takes."
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kyiv with the greatest financial support.
"In the supply of weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone else in continental Europe," he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized "public bidding under the motto: battle tanks, submarines, aircraft - who will demand even more."
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda will benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Metsola calls for fighter jets and long-range weapons to be given to Kyiv - DW - 09.02.2023
President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola during a meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke, called for providing Ukraine with aircraft and long-range weapons.
"EU member states should quickly consider, as a next step, the provision of long-range systems and fighter jets you need to protect freedom, which many take for granted," Metsola said.
According to her, the response should be proportionate to the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union," she said, addressing Zelensky.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
Zelensky, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on the way to EU membership.
"We are approaching the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
The winning Ukraine is a member of the winning European Union," Zelensky said in his speech to European parliamentarians.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself from "the most anti-European force of the modern world."
"They are trying to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life with an all-out war.
But for what?
In order to destroy the European way of life as such after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of all 27 elements of the European way of life, 27 EU countries.
We will not allow this," the President of Ukraine stressed.
Zelensky will ask to speed up the supply of weapons
The day before, DW reported that Zelensky arrived in Brussels to receive the support of the European Council and speed up the provision of critical weapons to Ukraine.
According to a source from Zelensky's advanced diplomatic team, during Zelensky's visit to the United States at the end of December last year, Kyiv received "an agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support, which Congress voted for."
"Therefore, the President of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally goes to other capitals," the source said.
At the same time, the diplomat noted that, "of course, such decisions are not a matter for the European Council, but for decisions of member states."
Zelensky is expected to voice Ukraine's needs for weapons during the European Council summit and speak personally with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member states.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine needs, first of all, long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia launches major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the west of the region has increased markedly over the past week, analysts said in a report on February 8.
It also notes that geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvorichne northwest of Svatove.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not allow Russia to achieve significant success
According to experts, the involvement of significant units of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces have so far prevented Russian troops from making significant gains.
The ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet reached full pace, the Russian command has not yet commissioned parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after deployment in Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in the Luhansk region now have the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces are setting the conditions of battle, ending the period of the Ukrainian initiative since August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final culmination on the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions," the report says.
Analysts predict that this culmination could likely create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces to use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning report, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Russian troops, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive operations in five directions: Kupiansk, Liman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivske in the areas of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Mariinka and Vuhledar.

SpaceX has limited the ability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones through Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
Adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak on Thursday, February 9, called on the American company SpaceX to determine whether it supports Kyiv in the war unleashed by Russia.
Thus, he reacted to the information that Elon Musk's company limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
"Companies have to decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to free life and Ukraine - and then they do not figure out how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its 'right' to kill, seize territories," Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink doesn't have to be a weapon
On the eve of the chief operating officer of SpaceX Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which Ukrainian army actively uses in countering Russian aggression, "was never intended for use in the form of weapons."
"However, Ukrainians use it in an unforeseen way, which is not part of any agreement.
We know that the military uses it for communication, and that's okay.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes," the director was quoted as saying by Reuters.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX may "limit their ability to do this."
"There is something we can do and have already done," she added.
What measures the company has taken, it refused to specify.
SpaceX "bargained" with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX gave Kiev free Starlink systems to provide the population with Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over the issue.
At the time, it estimated the required funding by the end of 2022 at $120 million and over the next 12 months at about $400 million.
The issue of securing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, and in the European Union, but soon the owner of the company Musk said that SpaceX withdrew its request to the US defense department to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine reached an agreement with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky believes that relations between Berlin and Kyiv against the background of Russian aggression are developing "in waves" - they have "ups and downs".
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
"By nature, I am a fast man.
Others act more slowly, which may also be due to their bureaucracy," Zelensky said, adding that in the conditions of war, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every second.
Revitalization with air defense
The President of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage the "conservative attitude" of Germany had changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally received support from Steinmeier [German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier], with whom I had difficulties before, especially because of the so-called Steinmeier formula," Zelensky said.
He stressed that "good work" had been done to change the relationship.
"We received air defense systems IRIS-T, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives," the President of Ukraine said.
According to Zelensky, Berlin managed to increase the pace of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T systems to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate over the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kiev has returned relations with Germany "to a difficult phase," the Ukrainian president said.
He called the discussions on the matter "emotional and complex."
"I have to force him [Scholz] help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this assistance is needed not by us, but by Europeans," Zelensky explained.
Categorical about fighters
After allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kiev with battle tanks, discussions began on the transfer of fighter jets, which Ukraine insists on.
Here Scholz took a categorical position: Germany will in no case transfer combat aircraft.
At the same time, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv "as long as it is necessary."
He made the corresponding statements after meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of European Union leaders on Thursday.

a new PM has already been nominated - DW - 10.02.2023
The Moldovan government, together with Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilitsa, resigned.
This decision was made after consultations with President Maia Sandu, Gavrilitsa reported on Friday, February 10.
"After a year and a half in government, it is time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, fight against corruption and integration into the European Union," she said.
According to her, during the work of the government "faced energy blackmail."
"They thought we would surrender and act like previous governments that betrayed national interests, but that was not the case. We worked in a continuous crisis mode," Havrylytsia said.
She did not specify the reasons for the decision to resign, citing only a lack of "support and trust at home."
Sandu thanked the prime minister "for her tremendous sacrifice and efforts," also noting that Havrylytsia headed the government during the crisis.
"Despite unprecedented challenges, the country was governed responsibly, with great attention and dedicated work.
We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and bankruptcy," the Moldovan president said.
Moldovan PM on Russian war: The main risk is energy security
The new prime minister may be the secretary of the Security Council
According to the law, the cabinet of ministers will continue to perform duties until the new government takes the oath.
To replace Gavrilitsa, Sandu has already proposed her security adviser, the current secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and former Minister of the Interior of the country Dorin Rechan.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, in which the Action and Solidarity party has a majority.
Havrylytsia was her representative, so voting for Rechan should not be a problematic issue, notes the AFP news agency.
Rechan has already stated that he plans to continue to seek Moldova's membership in the European Union.
According to him, the priorities of the new government will be "order and discipline, the breath of new life in the economy, as well as peace and stability," writes Reuters.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.
The country has twice experienced a complete blackout across the country as a result of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly limited gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to cut them off completely.
Chisinau called the decline in supplies a political decision unrelated to payment issues.

What are dangerous aftershocks?
Despite the fact that due to sub-zero temperatures in the region there is less and less hope for the rescue of people, rescue work continues.
So, 102 hours after the earthquake in southern Turkey, a family of six people was freed from the rubble, according to the state news agency Anadolu.
A total of 166,000 Turkish and foreign rescuers, policemen, doctors and volunteers are involved in rescue operations.
Of these, more than eight thousand rescuers are from 61 countries.
A total of 97 countries have sent aid to Turkey, Turkey's foreign ministry said.

In Turkey, in the region affected by tremors, almost 171 thousand tents were pitched.
According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets were transferred to the crash site.
In Syria, however, representatives of the NGO White Helmets, which are carrying out a rescue mission in rebel-held regions, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a White Helmet spokesman said that only two small international teams of volunteers who did not have rescue equipment had arrived in the region to assist.
In addition, according to him, the region does not receive any humanitarian aid from the UN.
Meanwhile, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports from rebel-held northern Syria said one shipment of U.N. aid had arrived in the region the day before, but lacked shelter tents or rubble clearing equipment.
About three thousand volunteers of the "White Helmets" are involved in rescue operations in northern Syria.
According to them, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people were found, more than 3.3 thousand people are considered dead.
More than 10 thousand were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
Early in the morning of February 6, a powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.8 occurred in southeastern Turkey, as well as in northern Syria.
This earthquake was the most powerful in almost a century of observations.
The last time Turkey experienced tremors of such strength was in 1939, when about 33,000 people died.
Within less than 12 hours, southeastern Turkey was rocked by a second powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.5, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

Cyprus undergoes decisive round of presidential election - DW - 12.02.2023
In the Republic of Cyprus on Sunday, February 12, is the second, decisive round of presidential elections.
It included former Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulidis and former Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations Andreas Mavroyanis.
Conservative politician Christodoulidis received 32 percent of the vote in the first round, his rival in the second round Mavroyanis, who is supported by left-wing forces, scored 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling party "Democratic Rally" (DISY) Averof Neofitou.
The DISY party, after the defeat of its candidate in the first round, could not decide who to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, the AFP agency notes.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal vote.
He forms and heads the government of the country.
The winner of the current elections will hold the post of head of state for five years and will become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was split in two in 1974 as a result of a putsch supported by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the northern sector of the island, occupied by the Turks, proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Ankara.
The last negotiations on the attempt to reunite Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots take part in the elections - about 560 thousand people.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote for them.

Energoatom reported a new threat to ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
President of NNEGC Energoatom Petro Kotin called the decrease in water in the Kakhovka reservoir by Russians a new threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP).
"There are a lot of threats at ZNPP.
The decrease in water in the Kakhovka reservoir is a new added threat," Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the level of the reservoir is 13.8 meters at a normal level of 16 meters, "so that the station receives recharge for its generators, for turbine condensers and for security systems."
"In recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and is slightly rising, because it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m," Interfax-Ukraine quoted Kotin as saying.
He explained that the Russians, who control the locks at the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, began to discharge less water, while the inflow at the top of the Dnieper increased.
The President of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at ZNPP is sufficiently filled and so far there is enough water, but if the level of the reservoir drops to a critical point, this, according to him, "will be a big problem for ZNPP."
Kotin stressed that the level of 12 meters will be critical, emergency - 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will not allow a critical situation.

The Russian and Ukrainian sides blame each other for this, there is no independent data on who is shelling the ZNPP.
Israel to step up campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to intensify its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, said on Sunday, February 12, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"The government is meeting today to prepare for an even broader counteraction to those who commit terrorism," Netanyahu was quoted as saying by Reuters.
The announcement followed a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
Police shot and killed a man at the scene and arrested and questioned family members of the Palestinian.
Israeli law enforcement officers welded doors and windows in the house of the family of a Palestinian.
The next step after sealing may be the demolition of the attacker's house, writes AP.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was killed by a gunshot during a standoff with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinians fired a rocket towards the Israeli border on Saturday evening.
The Israeli army said the missile was intercepted, dpa reports.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for weeks.
The Israeli army conducts near-daily raids in the West Bank, leading to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported dead during them or in their own attacks.
In addition, Palestinian attacks in 2023 have killed nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman.
According to human rights activists, about 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022, making this year the deadliest in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, last year 30 people were killed in attacks by Palestinians on Israelis, writes AP.
Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, dpa notes.

Greek Foreign Minister visits Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - long-term opponents, writes on Sunday, February 12, dpa.
On the same day, the Foreign Ministers of the two states Nikos Dendias and Mevl√ºt Cavusoglu held an unexpected meeting, at which, as recorded by the cameras of Greek television, they even embraced.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
Cavusoglu thanked Dendias for making Greece one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the disaster.
He added that both states would try to start a dialogue again and resolve their problems.
"Greece's assistance to the Turkish people does not end there," the Greek Foreign Minister stressed.
According to him, Athens "will do everything" - bilaterally, as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit a disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams are operating in the Antakya and Hatay regions.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
Political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope for several days that the assistance provided by Athens to Ankara could be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO Allies had already shown solidarity with each other during the strong earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This assistance, known as "earthquake diplomacy," then helped to achieve some d√©tente.
Conflict over islands
Athens and Ankara have been sparring for sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean for decades.
Ankara questions Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes,, Samos and Kos.
Greece allegedly violates international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous amphibious assault craft on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
Read also: Greece and Turkey on the verge of armed conflict?
Turkey almost daily backs up its claims by flying fighters over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Warming Ankara with Armenia
Against the background of the tragedy caused by earthquakes, there is also a warming of Turkey's relations with Armenia.
Ankara has opened a crossing closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia passed for victims of the disaster.
In addition, Armenia reported sending two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake that occurred on February 6 and killed more than 33,000 people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are strained for historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War.
As the successor to the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits that it exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide was condemned, in particular, by the United States, Germany and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the background of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation has only become more complicated.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers began in Brussels, during which a meeting in the so-called Ramstein format is also held on February 14.
The agenda of the event is to further increase support for Ukraine in the war and increase the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting that NATO must provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war."
"We do not see any signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensive actions and new attacks," he was quoted as saying by Reuters.
"This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics," Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations on the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.

During the meeting, ministers are expected to endorse long-term methodological recommendations for the Alliance's defence planning.
"Allies will discuss investing in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure," Stoltenberg was quoted as saying by Interfax-Ukraine.
What to expect from the ninth Ramstein
On the same day, the U.S.-led Contact Group meets at NATO Headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, attended by Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.
The head of the Ukrainian defense department will also join a special session of the meeting of NATO defense ministers.
"More than 50 countries participating in the Contact Group are united with you in this struggle for Ukraine's sovereignty and self-defense," Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of the meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership previously expressed hope that at the next meeting of "Ramstein" partners could decide on the provision of Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that as a result of this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of the provision of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants ban on tour of Russian artists in EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine collects data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations financed from the Russian state budget to include them in a new package of EU sanctions.
This was announced in an interview with DW by Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Halyna Hryhorenko.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
According to Hryhorenko, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policies and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum says very clearly that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation," says Grigorenko.
In her opinion, dialogue through culture with Russia is impossible now.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
Thus, recently the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DPR" in the Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour
However, according to Grigorenko, this is not enough and those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin's policy still manage to tour in Europe.
"To cancel officially such tours, you need to have names on the European sanctions lists," Hryhorenko says, adding: "We are working to ensure that Russian cultural figures who promote Russian narratives outside Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible on the territory of the EU to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts."
According to Hryhorenko, this issue in Ukraine is dealt with by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group under the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As previously reported, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen at a joint press conference with President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9 noted that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at a summit in Kyiv.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of cultural and media figures of the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 names.

The United States is ready to sell Poland HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment for $ 10 billion
The US State Department has approved the possible sale of military equipment and services to Poland worth about $ 10 billion.
This was reported by the correspondent of the Voice of America Jeff Seldin with reference to the Pentagon Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
First of all, we are talking about launchers of the M142 HIMARS high-mobility artillery missile system with ammunition, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such an acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe," the agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the acquired equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and deter regional threats."
In general, Poland has requested the purchase of the following equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of HIMARS boot device module;
- 45 Army M57 Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of GMLRS guided multiple launch rocket system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
The agreement also includes missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and equipment of personnel, support for system integration, engineering and logistics services of the US government and contractors, training, sensors, other related elements of logistics and software.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is in addition to launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw has also requested rocket launchers from South Korea.
NATO Secretary General called on the United States to be prepared for Russia's long war in Ukraine
The possibility of sending Ukraine fighter jets for protection in the war against Russia is not off the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"The first step in providing advanced aircraft is to have soldiers or aviators who are able to use them.
This is a process that takes some time.
We started this process today," Sunak said of the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
"Nothing has been removed from the agenda, and our leadership on this issue is something we should all be proud of."
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks would arrive in Ukraine as early as "next month" and said Ukraine "should never again remain vulnerable to attack" and called for "arming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term".
According to him, Britain has agreed to expand its training program, which has trained 10,000 troops over the past six months, and promised, according to CNN, "to speed up the delivery of our equipment" to ensure Ukraine's achievements on the front line in the coming "days and weeks, not years."
During the press conference, President Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: "Today it is clear that we have the support of Great Britain.
Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity."
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he reiterated the call for the provision of Western fighters to Ukraine and added that he "heard from Mr. Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighter jets" to Kyiv.
The Russian embassy in London has already said that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military-political consequences" for the whole world.
Today, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kyiv continues to talk with Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: "I spoke with Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra to coordinate our international steps as Russia's full-scale invasion approaches the annual mark.
I thanked for the latest decision on tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aircraft."
Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat told CNN that Ukraine would need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.
Observers say the West has a short amount of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the start of an expected new Russian offensive in the spring or even February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin has been trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since early January.

Vaccination is hindered by "politics and profits"
The director-general of the World Health Organization said on Sunday that if countries do not use existing tools effectively to fight the pandemic, it will not be over.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it," said Tedros Adan Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the tools we need ‚Äì effective health care tools and effective medical tools.
But the world has made poor use of these tools," Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries.
Obstacles to achieving the WHO's goal of vaccinating 40% of each country's population against coronavirus are "politics and profits," the WHO chief said, "not production."
"Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, must give up their place in the queue for vaccine delivery to COVAX and the African Vaccine Purchase Fund," Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaboration initiative created to equitably distribute the COVID vaccine.
Ghebreyesus also stressed that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperation to protect other nations.
Together!" said Ghebreyesus on Twitter.
The WHO official also called on vaccine manufacturers to "make it a priority and implement their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [African Vaccine Acquisition Fund]" and become "much more transparent about what goes where."
AVAT is an initiative of the African Union aimed at providing access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to "share know-how, technology and licenses and give up intellectual property rights."
Earlier, Karren Attia, a contributor to The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share with the world a "prescription" for the Moderna vaccine.
"The U.S. administration has trumpeted the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, it is not good-hearted philanthropy; This is arrogance.
Poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; They initially asked for a fair opportunity," the columnist noted.
"We're not asking for charity," Tedros said, "we're calling for smart investments in global recovery."
As reported by Voice of America, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the relinquishment of patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
Such a refusal should, according to the US administration, allow poorer countries to produce analogue drugs of patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, and others opposed it.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University said Monday it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, nearly 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said the decision to send F-16 jets to Ukraine would be a "very serious decision" that was "not easy to make."
One of Ukraine's closest allies said this in an interview with CNN amid discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
According to CNN correspondent Laura Kunsberg, in Warsaw, in an exclusive interview airing Sunday, President Duda said sending F-16s would pose a "serious problem" for Poland because the Polish air force has fewer than 50 aircraft and the Poles themselves "don't have enough ... And we're going to need a lot more."
Duda also stressed that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have a "very serious need for maintenance," so "it is not enough just to send a few aircraft."
President Duda's remarks came amid discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine, including more ancient Western tanks and anti-missile systems.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has persistently urged its NATO allies to send Patriot units and Western-made tanks such as German Leopard tanks to Kyiv.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made an unannounced European tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with the means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelensky called combat aircraft "wings of freedom" for Ukraine.
Zelensky repeated the same message in Paris and Brussels.
In a speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelensky said he was "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hoped that the next talks on providing Ukraine with aviation would also be successful.
"I heard from some European leaders about their readiness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
Now I have a series of bilateral negotiations, we will raise the issue of fighters and other aviation.
Therefore, we continue our work here in Brussels," Zelensky said.
As reported by "Voice of America", last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to transfer its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said his government would consider Kyiv's request for F-16s.
Earlier this month, US President Joe Biden denied supplying F-16 jets from the United States, but Western experts believe that these planes could come to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that in the past, weapons that the United States refused to supply ended up in Ukraine if European NATO allies agreed to transfer them.
Ukrainian military began training on Leopard 2 in Germany and Poland
CHISINAU, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, Moldova's president announced Moscow's plot to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country "at Russia's disposal" and thwart its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maia Sandu's briefing came a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had intercepted Russian intelligence plans to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.
"The plan for the next period involves the involvement of saboteurs with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will resort to force, attack some state buildings and even take hostages," Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate government of Chisinau to an illegitimate one," Sandu said, "which would put our country at Russia's disposal and stop the process of European integration."
She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed."
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu's claims.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought closer relations with its Western partners.
In June last year, she received the status of a candidate for the European Union, the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several cases of organizing criminal elements and stopped attempting violence."
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a member of NATO, has faced a number of challenges.
These include a major energy crisis after Moscow sharply cut gas supplies; rapid inflation; as well as several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed airspace and debris that were found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said Russia wants to use Moldova in its war against Ukraine and that information obtained by intelligence agencies contained what she called instructions on rules for entering Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control," Sandu said.
She said Moldova's parliament should pass bills to provide the intelligence and security service, as well as the prosecutor's office, with "the necessary tools to more effectively combat risks to the country's security."
The president added that the plan would "rely on several internal forces, but especially criminal groups," and continued the names of two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.
Last year, both men were sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom.
Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by Shor's populist, Russia-friendly party also rocked Moldova amid the energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday came after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Rechan, to succeed Gavrilita.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has for years supported campaigns of influence and destabilization in Moldova, which often involve the use of weaponized corruption to achieve its goals."

Stories from the war: "Grandma with a red flag" threw him away when she learned about Bucha
An employee of the Center for Strategic Communications found the same woman.
üîª A living symbol of "pro-Russian Ukraine," a woman who, according to Russian propaganda, "bravely opposed nationalists," is actually grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only supported her with food, but also protected her from the wrath of ordinary Kharkiv residents.
üîª Anna Ivanovna explains that she went out with a red flag to, as she thought, the Russian military, so that they "would not smash Ukraine."
And in the aggressor country, her motives were twisted, which is why she now feels like a "traitor".
üîª She is currently in one of the city hospitals in Kharkiv with her husband.
üí¨ The military urges not to despise the old woman.

Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in Brest and Gomel regions.
There is a threat of missile strikes by the enemy on military and civilian infrastructure throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as provocations by the enemy on this section of the state border of Ukraine.
We abandon Soviet weapons and switch to NATO models ‚Äì Zaluzhnyi
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi had a telephone conversation with the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
According to Zaluzhnyi: "We also discussed with my American colleague a promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will complete.
I also informed General Milley about the difficult situation in the east of our country, in particular in the Izyum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, hold the occupied lines and positions."
‚Äî The one who invented this hellish summer was clearly crazy! Wild complained and stretched out her arms in front of her, as if she wanted to reach for the ghostly coolness.
"You say the same thing every time," Varta remarked indifferently, stirring the ice in the cocktail. ‚Äî In autumn ‚Äî because it rains and drizzles, the grasses rot.
In winter ‚Äî because it's cold and the potion freezes out.
In the spring ‚Äî because it rains again...
"I would sit in my Carpathians," the guard shrugged indifferently.
Although she didn't particularly like the city.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and turmoil.
She liked to imagine familiar streets calm, quieter and greener, like a hundred years ago or before.
But there is no magic that would allow you to return to the past.
"Phah!
Say this! ‚Äî Wild clapped her hand on the table ‚Äî and the vases of flowers timidly reared. "If you spent a week in the meadow with my grandmother Rutmera with her colleagues, praying for every truck passing that you would only be taken away from there to any city.
Unless you loved from morning till night to weed the beds, sort out herbs, hang them under the ceiling and at the same time sing old orders.
Because the dragonfly rested its horn that without words none of my potions would be as it should.
And wait, I have not yet mentioned the harvesting of all sorts of dust at night..
But where there, our white-handed, you would die, even a week would not pass!
Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, and that they like such a "job", that it is their conscious choice and so on.
But if you start really understanding this topic, it becomes scary...
Now the problem of involving Ukrainian women in prostitution is particularly acute.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea of legalizing prostitution... Because of this, I didn't treat him very well.
I think that it is necessary to adopt the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of "Swedish model" there.
At the same time, they order not a woman, but a client.
Women are helped to get out of this "business", and to make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything else.
Men should also consider whether they are buying "pleasure" or violence...
There is a need for another... You can see me where the nearest optics are with a doctor to write a prescription for glasses.
And you need to buy a frame, high-quality... looked at some sites with frames, I was pleasantly impressed - it is cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $ 300 for them, the frame was average (or even lower).
I don't know what frames are in stores, but the prices in online stores are pretty normal.
But, as for some cosmetics, I can say for sure that it is more expensive here.
Chey much.
Our multifocal lenses with glasses are very expensive (this is compared with our average wages).
Given the budget of our family (especially the fact that we need to rent a house), then $ 300 for glasses, then a fairly high amount.
Did your doctors not offer you an artificial multifocal crystal?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then lens intolerance began, a year after that I wore hard lenses, I became severely allergic to almost all cosmetics.
For 4 years I have been wearing glasses all the time, I wear lenses very rarely.
Yes, I also read that covid affects vision.
Also, after 40 years, there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than $ 1000, very expensive.
Yes, glasses are fashionable now.
I asked one doctor why he did not wear lenses or did not make laser correction for himself, so he replied that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of UAH 1500, this amount is unrealistic
My glasses mask wrinkles now
Yes.
My mother has little work experience.
She worked little: at first small children who often get sick, then she looked after her grandmother... So the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father receives 3800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8000 hryvnias and all these funds had to be paid for rent.
In good times (before covid), there were bonuses, but with the onset of quarantine, there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
Therefore, many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for a family or buy a card, but then they lose contact with their family...
Yes, there are advantages.
But my husband as he has a day off, he goes to the apiary)
Good evening
According to the order from the day of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until control over these seaports is restored.
It is indicated that such a decision is due to the inability to service ships and passengers, to ensure an adequate level of navigation safety and environmental protection during Russia's military operations in these regions that pose a threat to human life and health.
The Russian Federation uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, Reuters writes about this, referring to the statement of the British Foreign Ministry.
The UK Foreign Office on Sunday said Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation on social media about the war in Ukraine and politicians from certain countries, including Britain and South Africa.
It is noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs came to these conclusions on the basis of expert research.
"The department said that this study revealed exactly how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign works, aimed at manipulating international public opinion regarding the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers," writes Reuters.
According to the study, the troll factory "used Telegram to attract and coordinate new supporters who subsequently acted against Kremlin critics, bombarding them with comments in support of President Putin and his war."
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
"Traces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including: Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok", ‚Äì stated in the message.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said her government had already "warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations."
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll factories to break into our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war," Truss concluded.
Ivanna, now I will explain to you.
You have such a hair structure that all the hair is almost the same length.
There are very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest result, you need to either do hair thinning.
But it will greatly affect hair density.
So I didn't.
Or do staining the roots to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I also did not paint the roots.
Therefore, the transition can be a little abrupt.
I can raft you the transition, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be dyed to your color, so when the hair grows back, you will not notice the difference.
About hair quality.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects hair quality.
Hair can become drier , this is normal because it is blond.
Without loss of quality, such a blond cannot be made.
If you do the right hair care, the condition of the hair will return to normal.
Please write what care from Matrix you use.
Perhaps he is too weak for a blond.
We can sign up for free toning to make a smoother transition.
This photo also has a rather sharp transition.
Because a large percentage of blond in the root zone.
Please write when you could drive up so I can take a look.
If we do toning, it will take about three hours.
A lot of positivity from what I do at my job.
I help people - this is the most important thing and I wanted it.
Let it be in this way, but it is helping people whom almost no one in the world helps at all and will not say "good afternoon" with a smile of their hearts.
I found wonderful basic lessons in learning Czech on the Internet today.
Here in the morning I clean the chambers where homeless people sleep, at this time I am alone and the door to these 3 rooms is closed.
I listen to these lessons in headphones and repeat after the lecturer.
From the outside I speak to myself, but it's good that at this time no one sees or hears üòÖ me I think an hour a day I can learn the language like that.
So another huge positive of this work is learning the language in headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ
Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
Its longest peace period lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
Most of the modern territory of Russia at one time was occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural background of Russians.
The cult of invasion and raid has been successful throughout Russian history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then 20 years under Putin's regime.
These cultural characteristics have shaped state institutions that cultivate the politics of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of wars of conquest because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet fully felt the effects of economic sanctions.
Their standard of living has not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protest movements within the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand tougher sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia poses a threat to a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
Russian troops are shelling and seizing nuclear power plants in Ukraine.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was de-energized.
They fired from tanks and took control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also detected over the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant in the Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacking nuclear power plants.
Missile hits, overheating of the reactor or spent fuel due to failures in the supply of electricity and water can lead to radiation leakage.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia does not have to press the "red button" to cause a catastrophe on a planetary scale.
Support Ukraine ‚Äì the Russian threat can only be overcome together!
Russians rob Ukrainian farmers and illegally export grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and first harvests from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a conscious policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory decided to "expropriate surplus harvest last year and this year" from southern Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take away seed from farmers, but at the same time require them to successfully sow in order to send new crops to Russia.
Prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, he threatens with physical violence.
Russia repeats the Soviet policy of mass robbery of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
Thus began the Holodomor in 1932-33 and private property on Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of a "liberation war with the Nazis", Russia, in particular, provokes famine in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country renounce any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine are taking children hostage.
They force their mothers to find out the locations of the Ukrainian military, for refusal ‚Äì they threaten to kill children.
People are pushed to a tough choice: lose their children or become traitors to their homeland and be punished for this.
The Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine Lyudmila Denisova has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated amendments to the legislation "to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbas."
Call on your authorities and the international community not to allow the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don't like their indecision.
Because NATO does not close the sky over Ukraine, thousands are killed.
More than 50,000 civilians have already been killed.
However, without Western weapons we would be powerless, but I have to say that they come in insufficient numbers and late.
However, we need to become a member of NATO for our future.
I think that this is beneficial for the alliance itself, because with weapons from NATO and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe
Did you know that the Ukrainian was invented how to reload the "disposable" anti-tank system nlaw?
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage
Russians deserve all the worst and worst imaginable.
Therefore, to some extent, I am happy with what is happening.
Because this war has not been going on for 4 months, it began around the 15th century, I can't remember exactly now.
But all these hundreds of years there has been an attempt to make us their slaves.
One generation does not have time to die, as another is born and accepts the battle.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have returned to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state
In general, it is wild for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But due to the transience of events, I did not even have time to comprehend, reflect on the very fact that there is a war going on and what it means to me
It is super here,but you need to learn the language and go to work, I will not be able to sit on the maintenance of the Czech state,but the problem is that my husband does not want me to sew constant quarrels to work.and it will be necessary to return to Ukraine but they could stay, but he will do everything for us to go back.very difficult situation
He doesn't want us to live here, that's his answer
Yes, he is glad that we are here, but in order to sit permanently at home, I myself took the children to school and to swim, I ask that we stay here after the war, and he says that we will immediately go home, he will not make us documents
I probably won't be able to leave myself if he has a long job, and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic
Long beating
I want to learn to be a hairdresser when the war is over, and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic, if he does not want to, then surely we will have to go to a lawyer.now it is too early to do anything.but here he clearly told us that after the war we are immediately going home.
We will go home ,but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic ,and when we lived in Ukraine he said that he would take us away)))well, now I know the truth
Yes .thank you.we will get out of the situation ,the main thing is that the war ends!! Everything will be fine.!!
No ,at the moment he has no one, that's for sure.I think the reason is that children want a lot in the Czech Republic ask him for toys, then to go to poppy donalds,scream ,run around the house.and he is accustomed to calm that no one bothers him and does not ask for a lower one.and here we came and everything annoys him and we need to spend money, and he is very economical.then it is better for us to live in Ukraine.
Outside the train window, birch trees and spruce trees sprinkled with black and white confetti forty, mournful water-pulling and commodity makers fluttered, dusted with fine gray rain.
Comrade Orlrv lay on a narrow Spartan bed, familiar to him, for it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed at his home.
He unfolded a simple set of the seconded ‚Äì rye bread and lard, wrapped in a gray rag.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and in life he was unpretentious, he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simply, because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he bent over the old ruined bag and carefully removed with two palms the crystal dome, which sparkled dimly in the gray light of the middle strip.
"What is it about you, comrade?" The young cadet, his neighbor, asked fearfully.
"A rarity," said Comrade Orlov with tenderness, unexpected for himself, securely placing the skull on the compartment table, "such, you see, thing... Very interesting and flammable thing.
This can be said to be my friend...
Yes, I watch work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately I find work for men, for special education.
I don't know Czech, I'm a teacher of young children, I'm not an engineer and I don't have a driver's license.
And also a big question is finding housing.
This is my first time abroad and I just don't know what to do and how to act.
I haven't been able to find a job for a month now, just cleaning one house.
I understand that the situation in Prague is very difficult, so I don't even go there
Here I have problems anywhere üò≠, I am abroad for the first time, I do not know the language and I am completely alone.
I and 20 other people were fired by the agency after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find a job anymore.
I ask people, I look at sites - nothing
I attend a course in this village.
One lesson per week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, now the situation is such that I have to hold on to free housing while it is.
And watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options ((
I don't want to just sit around because housing won't be free for long.
I understand
I don't want to take money from you.
I don't want the thoughts of lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in an ordinary city, not in the capital.
The difficult road from Ukraine for three days and a big city where a foreign language scared me very much.
I did not come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Maybe you know someone in smaller towns?
I can look after the kids, cook, clean, work in the garden...
I know how to sew, I have training to sew on a sewing machine.
I sewed custom bedding and some clothes.
Perhaps there will be such work.
I can do it!
I hug and send everyone congratulations!! üôèüèªü§óü§óü§óüíêüåû
Very glad to read you!
We now have the air raid alarm again(((
Today, more than 100 missiles üò° have arrived on the Ukraine
Today I worked with the wounded, it was difficult to concentrate.
All thoughts were around the child.
Jan studied at home...
Everything will be Ukraine!
We serve this evil spirits!
In the surgical department, my colleagues and I volunteer
Sometimes it covers, of course))))
Then I clean, cook, communicate))))
Because this is my home, my land!
Congratulations to everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! üôèüèªüíêü§ó
Thank you for the letter, and express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the issue of removing or not removing the association of Russian psychologists of European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is the main thing.
Let me give an analogy.
If in the sandbox one child takes a toy from another child, then most likely adults watching the children will try to reconcile the children and after some time the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox begins to hit another in the face with a spatula, then such a child will be isolated for a long time, and no one will play with him.
I also liked the analogy of a Russian psychologist colleague about the fact that when someone from a neighboring apartment kills someone, the entire apartment building is not imprisoned.
Among Ukrainian psychologists there are many discussions on the topic of exclusion of Russian associations from European ones, many feel how much pain that communication with Russian psychologists cannot withstand.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to work with several psychologists from Russia whom I know and share knowledge in order to treat the traumas of clients on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who at their level are trying to do many things to develop universal values in Russia.
Therefore, I am definitely in favor of a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that 5-10% of the population supports the war in Russia, and other figures in opinion polls are drawn by propaganda.
My wife left her homeland Ukraine because there is a war going on there.
My wife had a good job, and no matter how hard the war wasn't her, she never left her home.
In order not to sit on the neck of my wife in the Czech Republic, she tries to earn money, because once in 2009 she received a certificate of completion of masseuse courses in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money, who can.
Now there is only one problem: to learn Czech.
The wife learns and works languages and earns herself and her child for food, kindergarten, bus tickets, mobile communication services for clothes.
And at this time I am defending my homeland.
Thank you for supporting people who understand this.
I thank the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine in difficult times. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáøü§ù‚úä
I want to thank you for providing the opportunity to advertise my wife on providing massage services in your community.
The wife earns money on her own because she does not want to live on the taxes of the Czech people.
Thanks
Thank you very much.
It really helps my wife make money for her family.
Okay, I'll pass it on to my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of the Ukrainian people.
Some people are smiling at my wife's ad, but my wife offers her services.
My wife in Ukraine was a nurse, I work in the police, but the war has separated us.
It's good that my wife wants to work and earn money instead of waiting for help from your republic.

If this is not possible due to the introduction of an emergency measure or the introduction of quarantine
personal presence of students at school, the school provides interested students with distance education.
If the distance learning method is ordered in a school (classroom), students are obliged to do it in this way.
The most important safety rules

I really need a person who could act as a translator in a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we are dealing with an insurance company to fix the car.
Strakhova invited a person who, during the technical inspection of the car, can translate from Czech into Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa.
Tell me, can you help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific paper based on statistical analysis of body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a separate population.
In addition, I also have experience in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in the research of the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped to monitor bat populations in the Kharkiv region, as well as organize wintering for bats that were disturbed by people during the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned how to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation that is important to me.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to get acquainted with scientific works on tardigrades, observe their livelihoods under a microscope, and communicate with scientists who study them.
Therefore, the option of a deeper study of these and other microscopic organisms also interests me.
How has the attitude towards Ukrainians changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees ‚Äì analytics from the expert
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive refugee assistance from the EU ‚Äì this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milo≈° Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland had become the main defender of European values and had undertaken to solve many problems.
She sheltered 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
About 500 thousand people arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such strong support of their neighbors ‚Äì Poland and the Czech Republic ‚Äì and will tirelessly thank!
How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, ProUkra—ónu editorial office asked Jaros≈Çaw Kot, coordinator and translator of the Centre for Refugees in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analysis, which has offices not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the livelihoods of the Czechs.
There are long queues in labor governments, significant price increases in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government organized itself extremely quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.
This was foreseen.
Poland has been saying in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, there were fewer preparations for what would happen, while in Poland they were actively preparing.
For example, in the border regions of Poland and Ukraine, even before the start of the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be placed.
In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.
I heard people smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very balanced: to prepare for all these events before the start of the war.
I would like to note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing from the bombing from the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance in logistics ‚Äì movement through the territory of Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.
These are planes moving through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I had experience of cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as some may think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, abolished fare for Ukrainians.
They can travel free of charge on trains and public transport.
In addition, Poland made an agreement with German carriers that organized free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to get free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
For the most part, these are closed small school stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
Free meals, free medical first aid are organized there.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for several days, and already there on the spot they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
Large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been created.
The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they got the Russian embassy to take away objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes stood in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not allow anyone there.
Polish local authorities nationalized this, so to speak.
It was taken in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
Water, electricity will be supplied there, they are insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step ‚Äì the Sejm passed, and the Senate approved the law on fugitives from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free assistance for medicines to Ukrainians.
You just need to write SMS, get the code on the phone.
And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias to receive medicines for free in Poland.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are irrevocably provided to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.
Various funds are distributed, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which give packages with food, chemistry, clothing.
As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".
That is, "an event that has no analogues."
Such a huge openness.
For the Polish state, this is a huge expenditure.
To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
Language problem.
The questions start from clinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems, diseases.
The second problem is schools, where students, especially high school students, also at the beginning do not cope at all, cannot understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children not only have a good command of English, but in general their level is higher than the class they enter.
This is also interesting.
That is, Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine if they are valued so highly here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine is much more difficult to master this job here.
As a lawyer or accountant, I don't know such cases at all.
Doctors are now appearing in certain locations, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small polyclinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians legally.
The language problem is often the reason that prompts families to return home after a few weeks here.
There are a lot of such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.
These are Transcarpathia and western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active hostilities.
Here they did not get comfortable, did not find work.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, it is more convenient for them to return home.
This is also one such problem that has arisen in recent weeks.
How has the attitude towards Ukrainians changed?
According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, significant changes have taken place.
If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?
Poland has a similar situation.
Here, all television channels often quote the statement of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When there were events of Russia's attack on Georgia, he was in Tbilisi with President Yushchenko and other heads of state.
There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression probably will not stop at Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.
Then there may be the Baltic countries, maybe it can reach Poland.
That is, he would have foreseen it.
In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.
They see a threat in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that the war may also knock on our door.
Therefore, the attitude has changed to positive.
The Ukrainian flag Ukrainian anthem is no longer a "song of nationalists" or any enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they are in every country.
But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think quite differently about Ukrainians than before.
The claim about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians have consistently argued that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
This is perceived simply with laughter in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political overtones.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those segments of society that still doubted some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
When the Poles begin to think that there could be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is now in Ukraine.
There is constant talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.
Russia fears that it will strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How does the Polish authorities and society react?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland is doing this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.
The military contingent increased.
Currently, Poland is undergoing additional recruitment for territorial defense troops.
That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
It is tangible for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.
Among this, a new law on the defense of the homeland was recently adopted, where the budget has been significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.
The requirements for recruiting military personnel have been changed, many aspects that are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.
Your predictions have become reality in Syria, you have warned of a Russian attack.
What can you say from the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for a nuclear strike, I don't have much faith.
But there is such a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well.
It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.
I wouldn't want that, but it's the worst-case scenario.
A blow of low power, but for all television channels to show this "fungus".
To be seen from Poland, the Baltic countries.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are associated with the exhaustion of the physical and financial Russian army, the problems of Putin's environment, oligarchs who are now suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.
We have facts of the fire of hydroelectric power plants on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.
Such problems of a regional nature will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.
We also have tendencies of peaceful settlement of the war.
Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.
As much as possible, this will be delayed until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing a possible cessation of gas supply.
This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Since I am an analyst, I predicted this.
I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.
My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families who will feel the price increase.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely prices for all resources will begin to rise.
Now they are looking for different paths to certain alternative sources.
In addition, we already have several companies that carry liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.
As for oil, we have a striking factor that the Hungarian Prime Minister is actually cooperating with Putin.
Now there will be a buyout of gas stations in Poland, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe abandoned Russian energy, it would be a loss of Russia's source of financing for its army.
Even a schoolboy understands that without selling oil and gas, Russia will simply lose its ability to exist and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish media
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to Polish media.
What is told about this in the Polish media?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased significantly.
And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things happening nearby, he is in a city in the war zone.
That is, the actions of the president are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.
They indicate that Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused to receive military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in the Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.
You can't hear it here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, endurance, ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.
It does not fade or fall.
This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.
In fact, the image of Ukraine holds, and this is very important.
Good morning.
Sorry to bother with my problems again.
I am very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
Yesterday we tried to come to something, but the attempt was in vain.
The mother-in-law's friend also joined the conflict, helping to find this apartment.
She said that she was not looking for her for us, and if something does not suit us, we should leave, and she will make sure that it is her mother-in-law, and not us, who stays here to live.
Unfortunately, none of them thinks for a child who is used to this place, considers it their home, and in 3 months of change there are already 6 homes.
I'm very sorry, I couldn't even guess that such a situation would happen
Once again, sorry to give you trouble.
As for the bed, the situation looks strange.
My husband and I discussed this issue before I wrote to you that a bed was not needed.
He went here to me and to the child and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law decided for herself that he would sleep with her in the room and she wanted to spit on his opinions and desires.
I am very ashamed in front of you, your husband, Sharka and Ian, the owner of the apartment.
You tried so hard for us
Realized.
I thought it was going to be extended for some long time.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andrew's treatment, to do this at least until the end of the summer?
Perhaps you need a certificate for Andrew that he is sick .
In Ukraine, with such a diagnosis, a disability would be prescribed.
And since Inna does not go to kindergarten yet, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the home
I understood, then it would be good to go tomorrow with you .
I will make a barcode for myself and Andrew
I am worried that they will stop providing humanitarian aid for him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a lot of time.
Can you advise something?
I also wanted to ask if you received money for the medicines you bought for Andriy?
The handle mount drops down.
It is short, so you need to be very careful and not lose it.
Today, only 2 servings are sold.
Apricot is over.

Hadnes on 4.0.
As soon as people actively take, he does not allow ice cream at all.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
Just the queue becomes for ice cream, it begins to give out such nuances and people move on.
Freezes .
If there is no one ice cream, then it will creak and rub the piston.
And vanilla in mangoes can not be poured.
Can Magdalena come at 8.00 tomorrow?
It is necessary to wash the ice cream.
Today the ice cream is over, and tomorrow it is a different taste.

when Ukraine was independent, there was already Kyiv but still in the Soviet Union there was the city of Kharkiv from 1912 to 1934
I can't say that there were any other interesting events, but if at first there was democracy, it was much better, and probably now we were in the European Union;
