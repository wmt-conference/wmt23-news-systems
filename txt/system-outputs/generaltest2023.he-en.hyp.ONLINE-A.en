In the shadow of extinction: three cheetah cubs were born in Iran
The world's fastest animal falls victim to brutal poaching, droughts and fatal road accidents across the Islamic Republic •
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asian cheetah cubs recently emerged in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
It is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic situation of the endangered animal in the country due to droughts, poachers and fatal road accidents.
This is the first captive birth of a cheetah in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
Iran's IRNA news agency reported that the veterinary team in charge of the Turan National Park in northern Semnan Province had decided on a captive cesarean birth.
It also noted that fewer than 20 cheetahs have recently been recorded in seven different counties in the country.
Due to the danger of their extinction, the UN implemented a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now, Iran hopes that the new cubs can lead to an increase in the cheetah population in the future.
In January, Iran's deputy environment minister, Hassan Akbari, said that the country's cheetah population had dropped dramatically from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to just 12.
"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their habitats, hunting and even traffic accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world capable of reaching speeds of about 100 kilometers per hour.
Cheetahs can be found in various places around the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: we tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify has begun to try its luck in the hardware world as well •
After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small trial in the US •
We got our hands on the first device in Israel •
The vision: Make your old cars smart
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, built specifically to provide a solution for people with older cars.
A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try out the new product, which is currently only available to a few experimenters in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was outstanding, as our home car broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.
After two weeks of playing around, I realized how Car Thing can easily become an integral part of many people's systems.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.
From idea to reality
Way back in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email inbox - the possibility of purchasing a new device with voice control and 4G connectivity, which will make any old car system smart.
The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, those rumors made headlines again after the music service was updated with the condition of the vehicle — the same one we now know from the app — that activates as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled Car Thing, its smart system for vehicles, last April.
Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to deliveries.
So, of course, right after the press conference, I went to the website and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
Reconnecting to the site will give me the option to purchase the device with a small surprise - it won't cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the delivery person finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me with its build quality.
And it's slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and has a bigger, brighter and sharper touchscreen on the front than I expected.
Also, you will find next to the screen a round button and a dial that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively slim profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer the company to allow the dial to be changed so that I can control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate using the touchscreen.
Perhaps this will be possible in a future version update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for installing it.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to unplug the radios and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.
The Car Thing undoubtedly brings that feeling back with the way it is built.
All adapters were attached to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
On top of that, there are small buttons all along the top, which you can easily set up to play various playlists or podcasts.
By pressing and holding one of the buttons while listening, or by asking my voice assistant, I set up some playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio show I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that Car Thing was more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From old body to smart car
After a fairly simple physical installation, I plugged in the Car Thing.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.
This means you'll still have to connect your smartphone to your car, either via Bluetooth or via an AUX cable to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, since, like the application on a smartphone, it emphasizes album photos and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations according to your taste, the search screen and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touchscreen or using the manual dial.
What's more, you can call your device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify" at any given moment.
With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums, and even search for podcasts.
From Nissoni, she recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.
This is probably due to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of this article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for?
My experience using the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me considering it's still in the initial release phase.
Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, there is a little stuttering in the interface from time to time, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.
It's clear that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and of the various versions that leaked online during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to target it for.
After all, his activity boils down to controlling the app on a smartphone, and not much else.
What's different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and attaching it so that the smartphone is closer to us when driving?
This question is reinforced when you consider that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and in most cases will give the user much more functionality.
However, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
Being able to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I've come to appreciate over the past two weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it be launched here in our small country as well?
The Swedish company doesn't say much at the moment.
She didn't even share how many experimenters for the device she is currently operating around the world, and how much she plans to add at the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is the price, which is expected to be 79 dollars (about 255 shekels).
For now, Car Thing provides an initial glimpse into a concept Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said that there is currently no information on a plan to launch the device in Israel

Have you recruited talent for the company?
This way you will keep the competitors from "hijacking" it for you.
The economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is even more true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talent •
Here are some tips to help you keep it safe in the workplace
.
Despite the increase in the past month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be among the lowest in the world, and in the top ten OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150,600 unemployed, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is even more true when it comes to the most desirable workers – talent.
When it comes to those professionals and managers who are proven centers of knowledge, experience and ability – trends in the labor market show that competition for them, talent as they are called by employers, still exists in full force.
What this means for employers is that in the current state of the labor market, they don't have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after hiring a desirable talent, because as soon as he enters the company's gates, another company will already try to hijack him.
In other words, the competition for talent is so fierce that many will continue to receive a variety of tempting job offers even after their recruitment, with 30% of employees actually leaving only a month after receiving the job and starting work.
This is why wise employers will immediately move from the stage of recruiting talent to its retention stage, when the path begins first and foremost with preparing in advance and getting creative already in its onboarding process.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful onboarding process will get talent excited about their new workplace from day one and even look forward to what's to come.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage the proper onboarding process that will help retain the new talent:
It's no secret - sharing and readiness |
Share with the people who will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is vital and important to the company and the position, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and appreciated will feel welcome and strive to prove the expectations placed on Ben.
Knowledge is Power - Aligning Expectations |
On the very first day, they held a conversation with the talent to coordinate expectations.
Get to know their professional background and see where they see themselves in the future, so you can show them the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide them with to get there.
We Are All People – Personal Introduction |
During the absorption days, try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and take an interest in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who shows interest in him and allows him to realize and express himself beyond the boundaries of his job will appreciate this and will want to maintain it.
Curiosity Promotes |
Already at the onboarding stage, you can create attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily by talking about bonuses and benefits, but by exposing it to an exciting field or interesting technology, as such stimuli for creativity lead to curiosity and increased interest in the workplace.
In addition, encourage the talent to voice his thoughts and opinions for the various projects in the company and make it clear to him that they are important to the organization.

Electrification in the pocket: The cost of not closing coal plants in June - NIS 1 billion
Report by the Knesset Research and Information Center: Non-closure of coal-fired plants on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion
• Israel Electric Corporation: "The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"
.
The economic cost of not closing the coal-fired plants on the date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is reflected in the consumer electricity tariff, which, as noted, is expected to increase in the coming months due to the increase in the price of coal.
In addition, an additional excess of coal use of about 900,000 tons is expected in 2023, so that this will be reflected in an additional cost to the electricity sector due to the failure to close the coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas remains significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report states that the NIS 1 billion reduction in the electricity tariff in 2022 meant a reduction of about 4 per cent in the electricity consumption tariff for household consumers.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about NIS 1 billion, and the total reduction that could have been for the home consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the reform in the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the Israel Electric Corporation, which will build units powered by natural gas, intended to replace the coal-fired units 1-4 at the Orot Rabin site.
Following this decision, the government passed a decision in July 2018, stating that the activity of coal-fired production units 1-4 at the Orot Rabin power station should be stopped.
The decision sets timetables, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly, the coal-fired production units 1-4 will also cease operating on this date.
The Israel Electric Corporation said in response: "The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the ministry's decisions, a policy of reducing the use of coal to a minimum has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas."
Paying the price: everything you need to know ahead of the interest rate increase
Decrees constantly: Next week, the interest rate on the shekel is expected to increase by half a percentage point •
How much will the mortgage payment cost?
And what is recommended to do? •
All answers
The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4 percent in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts' estimates call for an increase rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.
If the interest rate is indeed raised by half a percentage point, it will already be 1.25 percent, the highest level in nine years.
This is after years in which the interest rate in the economy was close to zero.
The sharp increase in the interest rate increases mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and drastically burdens households.
With the help of Shai Tsror, a mortgage expert, we checked how much more we would pay and what should be done now.
If the interest rate rises by half a percent, how much will the monthly mortgage payment increase?
For a NIS 1.2 million mortgage, which consists of a 40% prime interest track, the monthly repayment will increase by NIS 125.
How much has the average mortgage increased since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, this has been a significantly sharper increase.
This is because the interest rates on the other tracks that comprise a mortgage (and not only in the prime track) also increased—in the index-linked track and in the fixed interest track.
If the interest rate does increase by half a percent, Tsror estimates that the increase will amount to about NIS 620 on a mortgage of about NIS 1.2 million.
The prime track (40% on this track) will complete an increase of about NIS 280, assuming an increase of another 0.5% next month.
The CPI-indexed variable interest rate track (26.7 percent in this track) will complete an increase of about NIS 120.
The fixed-rate unindexed interest rate track (33.3 percent in this track) will increase by NIS 220.
So what should be done today?
For those who have a mortgage that is mostly index-indexed, Tsror recommends considering refinancing to tracks that are not indexed.
For mortgage borrowers for whom the monthly repayment has increased significantly and find it difficult to meet the repayments, he recommends considering refinancing a mortgage and redeploying it for a longer period.
This is in order to reduce payments despite the increase in interest rates, since it is always better to meet the repayments and not be insolvent.
Regarding new mortgage borrowers, he highly recommends familiarizing yourself with the various tracks and adapting the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
The same is true in the future, when interest rates fall, they will be able to refinance a mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.
Regarding buyers of apartments from a contractor - Tsror recommends making early payments to the contractor and taking out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "Building Inputs Index" raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract is signed.
The residential construction input price index increased by 6.6 per cent in the past year.
Against the background of the increase in the price of this index, the Banking Supervision Department announced yesterday that it is considering requiring the creation of a mechanism that will make it possible to include indexation within mortgages, but the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of gasoline is getting more expensive, and Israelis will have to pay more than NIS 8 per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price for a liter of 95-octane gasoline will be NIS 8.08 •
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the tax on diesel will be extended until the end of 2022
A decade high: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 agorot per liter, to more than NIS 8 per liter starting July 1.
The new price for a liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08, and those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 agorot per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022, the Tax Authority said.
As noted, the price increase is due to the continued increase in oil prices, against the background of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the increase in the dollar exchange rate.
Were it not for the half-shekel discount subsidized by the government since April, the price of gasoline would have passed an all-time high of NIS 8.25 per liter.
The discount expires at the end of July, and the Tax Authority and the Ministry of Finance are currently promoting publication for public comments of an order extending the reduction in the tax on gasoline, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
In addition, as of August 10, an additional reduction of another half shekel will be determined, so that only from this date will the price of a liter of gasoline be reduced by one shekel, until November 15, 2022.
The Tax Authority said.
"We've reached a point where I can't remember five consecutive months of surplus state revenues.
We started a few months ago with the issue of reducing the tax on diesel.
We've been working for a week on extending the excise tax, gasoline and diesel tax by another four months, instead of half a shekel.
This is good for industry and citizen.
If we lower, it will affect inflation, lower production and ease the cost of living.
As finance minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus first and foremost on this," Minister Lieberman said at the Israel Democracy Institute's Hurvitz Conference on Economics and Society.
Currently, more than half of the price of fuel is taxes collected by the government (excise tax and VAT) – and this is a high tax rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy, because it affects both household and business expenses, the prices of public transportation and flights, transportation costs, and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the friendliest city for business
Petah Tikva came in second place in the Ministry of Economy's ranking of doing business •
After them: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon LeZion •
Minister Barbivai: "COVID-19 has emphasized the importance of local government in developing businesses"
.
Ashdod is the most friendly city for small and medium businesses.
For the third consecutive year, according to the Doing Business in Local Authorities Index of the Small and Medium Business Agency of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranked local authorities.
In second place is located the city of Petah Tikva and in third place Rehovot.
Next are located in order: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Be'er Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the Local Authorities Index.
This is the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a tool for the local authority, since it enables each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in the areas in which it operates.
The index is based on several parameters examined in each authority, which examine the authority's level of "friendliness" to businesses located within its boundaries.
The index divides municipalities into three size groups according to the number of residents, since a municipality with up to 50,000 residents is not similar to a municipality with more than 150,000 residents.
Tel Aviv surged this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information, and municipal taxes.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second place to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to 12th place and Netanya dropped from fifth place to 13th place.
A decline in the rating does not mean that the service to businesses of the authority has deteriorated, and in many cases it is due to the fact that the service of other authorities to businesses improved more and they increased in the ranking, while the authority that dropped in the rating improved its services to businesses less.
Among the immigrants in the ranking are Petah Tikva, which rose from sixth place to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th place to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
"Business - a growth engine"
The ranking shows that Nof HaGalil leads in local authorities with between 50,000 and 150,000 residents.
It is followed by Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modi'in-Maccabim-Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
In 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The index is intended to encourage local authorities to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the date the business opens and throughout its activity with the authorities," says Economy and Industry Minister Orna Barbivai.
"Businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of business output and about 60% of employees in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct influence on the businesses in it.
COVID-19 emphasized the importance of local government, and we saw that authorities that acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, became the first governmental interface for them."
Ran Kuiti, Director of the Small and Medium Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and essential role in the ability of businesses in their fields to prosper and flourish.
In the past two years, in which we have dealt with the coronavirus crisis, the authorities have greater weight in helping businesses survive in their areas and survive in general."
2021 by mail: 20 packages per household - and a jump in weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 – similar to 2020 •
The average weight per package is 435 grams - a 36% jump compared to 2020 •
Busiest month: December, when the average package weighed 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million postal packages arrived in Israel, almost 20 packages on average per household, according to Israel Post data obtained by Israel Hayom.
The number of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019, when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there has been a jump of more than 36 per cent a year in the share of packages arriving from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, a 36 per cent jump compared to 14,860 tons in 2020 and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per package jumped 60 per cent in two years, from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The surge in the weight of packages is mainly influenced by two main trends, both on the part of the seller and the buyer: the large shopping sites abroad consolidate items into one shipment and no longer send each product from the "shopping basket" in separate packaging.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the rapid delivery of deliveries, within a few days of ordering, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which the purchasers wish to receive close to making the purchase.
In 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month with the highest weight and most items from abroad was December, with 4.2 million packages weighing a total of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20 per cent higher than the annual average weight.
Black Friday effect
More packages arrived in December than in any other month, likely due to November's shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles' Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The large orders begin arriving in Israel between one and two weeks after purchase.
Research: Most employees in the economy are not aware that tax refunds can be received
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels •
Have you changed jobs?
Are you on unpaid leave?
Did you move from city to town?
You may be entitled to receive a considerable amount in a simple procedure •
All the details - inside
Most employees are not aware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to large amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report from two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds of NIS 3.6 billion, which means that you should also check whether you are eligible for tax refunds.
Many employees can receive a large sum, as four out of five employees are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, on the other hand, several tens of thousands of employees are submitted annually.
If you think these funds have gone down the drain anyway, think again: employees can apply to the IRS for refunds for six years back.
Tax:On conducted an in-depth study of 4,000 of its customers regarding tax returns during 2020.
The company has more than 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their distribution in terms of population groups and in terms of gender, age and geography.
The data show that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis and the placing of hundreds of thousands of workers on unpaid leave, there were a number of significant changes, mainly a 15% increase in the average repayment to a household, which stood at NIS 4,300 per year.
The reason is that unpaid leave is lower than salaries, so there is a gap between what the employee paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received in 2020 by a customer of the company was NIS 121,054 for refunds over the past 6 years.
What can I get tax refunds for?
One of the reasons to get tax refunds is a change in the workplace.
81% of people who changed jobs during the year received a tax refund of an average of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data show that 74% of women who gave birth and were on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to a refund of an average of NIS 3,538 for that year
Another reason for reimbursement is donations.
100% of people who donate and pay taxes received a refund.
Another factor for the refund is not registering credit points for alimony. 63%
The divorced did not update their alimony credit point, so the tax refund for each year that has not been updated, such a credit point is NIS 2,616.
Due to unemployment - unpaid leave: 93% of those who went on unpaid leave or unemployment and who earned over NIS 12,000 received a tax refund of NIS 4,021 for that year.
Additional reasons for tax refunds are: reimbursement for life insurance payments, mortgage life insurance, reimbursement of qualifying settlement, reimbursement for losses in securities, non-registration of credit points for men due to childbirth and distribution of tax refunds by geographical location.
- 94% of people who deposited for personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In an examination conducted on every NIS 1 million mortgage for 25 years, the cumulative tax refund for the period is over NIS 20,000 for the entire mortgage period
100% of those who move to a qualifying locality received a tax refund for the transition year, since confirmation of residency in a qualifying locality is given only after 12 months from the date the resident becomes a qualifying resident, and thus in fact the first year full tax is paid.
79% of customers holding securities were eligible for a tax refund for those years.
However, those who hold securities should check every year since losses are not rolled over from year to year, but only through filing a report.
56% of men who have had a child do not register credit points in the year of birth on their pay slip.
The rate of repayment can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tal Carmon, CEO of Tax:On: "The COVID-19 crisis has caused the salaried public in Israel to become much more active.
He is interested, checks and demands what he deserves in returns from the IRS.
It turns out that sitting at home, on unpaid leave or after layoffs, of hundreds of thousands of Israelis for many months, caused many employees to examine in depth what they deserve from the state.
It is important to know that today it is possible to carry out all the procedures for receiving tax returns digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past."
The employment market: fewer job candidates, more wages
Jobs Report for 2021: At the top of demand - jobs without experience •
The number of jobs offered increased by 50% •
"Looking for work, but not storming the market"
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decline in the number of resumes sent, and an average of only 23 candidates ran for each position, compared with 41 candidates in the previous year, according to a report by the Jobs website summarizing 2021, on the coronavirus crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were most interested in job-intensive fields such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
At the same time, jobs without experience led the demand with more than 38,000 searches, apparently due to the return of young people with no professional experience to search for immediate work, at the end of unpaid leave.
Sales and administration searches were 35,000 and 32,000, respectively, drivers and delivery people had 11,000, and guards had just under 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the COVID-19 crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average gross salary in Israel was NIS 11,675.
The monthly salary in software was NIS 17,915 on average, and in information systems analysis it was NIS 17,140.
However, there was a wage gap of more than NIS 2,000 between the center and the periphery: in the center of the country it averaged NIS 12,500, compared to NIS 10,795 in the north and NIS 10,135 in the south.
In terms of gender, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the volume of hours, was maintained at 36%.
Men earned NIS 13,295, compared with women's wages of NIS 9,740.
Trying to get back on track
On the business side, there was across-the-board growth in almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses craved working hands.
Thus, the supply of jobs increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40,000 jobs at Jobs.
A survey conducted by the website among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their financial status in 2022, 30% indicated their intention to increase total hires, but 72% believe they will find it difficult this year.
The largest supply was for jobs with no experience – and there were more than 58,000 on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration positions with about 44,000 jobs in every field, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and warehousemen still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Boimfeld, Director of Research and Content at Jobs: "Job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs.
In addition, the prolonged disconnection from the workforce makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living."
Central Bureau of Statistics: Israel's unemployment rate rises to 6.3%
Data from the Bureau survey indicate that about 270,000 Israelis remained unemployed in December 2021
In November, there were about 262,000 unemployed
The unemployment rate in the first half of December 2021 was 6.3%, about 270,000 Israelis, compared with 6.1% in the second half of November 2021 (about 262,000).
This is according to labor force survey data for the first half of December 2021 of the Central Bureau of Statistics.
The percentage of unemployed was 4.5% in the first half of December 2021, compared with 4.3% in the second half of November 2021.
In other words, that's 193,000 unemployed versus 180,300.
According to labor force characteristics in the first half of December 2021, among those aged 15 and over, this population included 6,607,500 residents in Israel, not including institutions and those living outside the communities.
Of these, 64.4%, i.e., 4,252,700 are in the labor force and the rest, constituting 2,354,800, are not in the labor force.
Of those in the labor force, 95.5%, or 4,059,700, are employed and the rest are unemployed.
Of those who are not in the workforce, 2.3% stopped working due to layoffs or job closures since March 2020.
The Labor Force Survey provides information on the labor force in Israel and is conducted on an ongoing basis by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
In the first half of December 2021, about 8,700 people aged 15 and over were interviewed on an ongoing basis.
In the second half of November 2021, about 8,900 people aged 15 and over were interviewed on a regular basis.
The survey population includes permanent residents of the State of Israel, tourists and temporary residents who have been staying in Israel for more than a consecutive year.
The survey enables monitoring of developments in the labor force, its size and characteristics, the extent of unemployment, and more.
'Not self-evident': Subliminal sanctifies Shabbat - and prepares for independence
Celebrating the fact that "we can live the way we want", getting excited about meeting the audience and making sure to spend time with the children •
Kobi Shimoni's Independence Day and Weekend, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
"Weekends are the most important moments in life, for me.
Kiddush and tradition are very deep roots in my soul.
Fridays at my place are dedicated to the children, Or (10) and Yonatan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and kiddush supplies, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses, or play cars on a sign.
Sometimes you go to the beach, or even just wash the car, but you always stop on the way to buy a gift at the toy store in the neighborhood – and there's always another excuse.
When we return home with all the gifts, the smells of cooking greet us."
What does your Friday dinner look like?
"I was blessed with cooks around me.
From my side there is Persian-Tunisian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, singing and joy.
From the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
When we reach my mother-in-law, amazing smells come from the lobby of the building.
I usually do Kiddush, together with the children, who know it by heart.
At the end of the day, my fun after eating is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of inflator."
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"As a child, I used to wake up on Shabbat to the sounds of Israeli music on Reshet Danzig and to the pale tracker skits that we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every remote corner of the country made him proud in his heart.
He passed away three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Kiddush and Shabbat were the holy of holies, especially in the sense that the whole family should be together.
I recently released a poem in his memory called 'Watching Over You', which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe he would be proud of this piece, which sanctifies the bond between father and son."
We will soon mark Israel's 74th Independence Day. As an ardent Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a holy day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who gets to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I would climb trees and tie strings to the house with Israeli flags.
Today my Independence Day is full of performances, and we always meet an insanely happy crowd, celebrating that we can live the way we want.
We must make sure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren also have this option, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted."
Her Friday: Esti Zakheim blesses Shabbat
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": Friday dinner that Esti Zakheim dreams of, and how does she cope with the fact that her husband observes Shabbat?
Tell us about your preparations for Shabbat
.
"The preparations begin on Thursday night, when I return from a play or workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking, such as goulash, roast and sauces.
On Fridays, in the first part of the day, I dedicate time to myself, meeting friends for coffee, a play, or a movie, or attending rehearsals.
In the summer, Saturdays come in late, and I have plenty of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just a good show.
At Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Varda, who turned 89, as well as friends."
Can you share more about cooking?
"I love shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, slicing and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry them.
On my Shabbat table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
I do most of the cooking, and of course they warm up on the plate on Shabbat.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and in winter - the cholent."
Your husband is a religious man and you are from a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with a Shabbat keeper is an endless compromise.
"Love your neighbor as yourself," in practice.
He can't go on family trips, so I often found myself packing up the kids and joining friends' family trips.
In addition, I am also the children's on-duty leader, the one who brings them back on Friday nights from parties and meetings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Shabbat, because I usually don't show up on Shabbat and get a kind of 'forced vacation' – and that's a good thing."
Who would you like to host on Shabbat?
"I would open a big table and invite 'My Dead.'
Sometimes I imagine what would have happened if my brother Daniel had been alive, or if my father, Shneur z"l, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
We must have been fighting over football and politics and enjoying each other."
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"We were a warm and united family.
On Friday afternoons, Mom would make a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pita bread from the market, and burn eggplants for tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hannah at Yad Eliyahu, or as she would say, Yad Elika, and she would make blinches.
Since only I didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the siblings, and took care of me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father at Jaffa Port, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing."

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck got engaged
Nearly two decades after their love story that ended in separation, Lopez and Affleck are back in each other's arms
Lopez split from baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
.
Nearly two decades after their first love story that ended in separation and a year after their highly publicized comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are coming full circle romantically and engaged.
Lopez shared the happy news last night (Friday) with her fans on her official website onthejlo.com
.
News of the engagement comes after Lopez was photographed walking around this week with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
The last time Affleck, 49, pulled out a ring and offered Lopez, 52, to be his forever was in 2002, when it was an eye-popping ring with a huge six-carat pink diamond, worth an estimated $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two broke up in 2004, accusing the media of being overly obsessed and constantly rummaging through their lives.
Since then, Affleck has managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as is known, has been married 3 times before, including to singer Marc Anthony, who together became parents of twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she split in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians talk: 'You can't make up what's happening to us'
"The chaos is endless," mom Kris Jenner insists of the new series starring the reality show's first family, backed by her daughters and the new producer
In an article that will be published in Shabbat magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR grinder, the brand factory and the change Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm no longer the same one who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie to post."
This may come as a surprise to many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 from the Disney content empire, which also includes the Marvel and Star Wars films, is the Kardashian family.
Details of the first family's contract with Disney have not been revealed, but estimates suggest a minimum of $100 million went to the family members, who now also serve as producers.
In a press meeting with the stars, each accompanied by an entire beauty team that takes care of makeup, hair and fine lines in clothes non-stop, the family members, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it is not a reality show, this time what is received on the screen is completely authentic.
"You can't make up what's happening to us," says Kris Jenner, the family's mother, emphatically, "the chaos is endless."
"We're showing how much we've grown since that show premiered in 2007," Khloe Kardashian says.
"When we started we were scared, a lot happens to us in life and you can't simply delimit everything to a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
Many plots were expedited in editing, wrapped in a sweet colorful film and forgotten aside.
That's not what life looks like in reality.
Now we are more exposed, facing the camera directly, naturally, not just a reality show but an authentic documentary series."
When confronted with their new involvement in the production of the series, which effectively gives them total control over the content received on screen, Chloe claims: "We're involved behind the scenes, watching footage while editing and commenting, but not from a defensive position but simply giving our opinion on what will make the series better.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel like I've grown emotionally from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they set more boundaries."
"I've grown up"
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all her might to change her image, from a cheap reality show to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I have grown up," she claims, "raising four black children, that is, from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality so that my children and the children of all my friends will have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the crooked system.
That's my motivation."
"I'm no longer the same Kim who thinks for hours about which bikini selfie to post," she insists, "but it's also not completely gone from my life.
A person has to be true to who they really are and take everything for fun."
On the reasons for firing the producer who discovered them Ryan Seacrest and their new and very profitable way in the industry, the significance of the move to Disney, the family's well-oiled PR machine and its impact on the brand's profitability and more, in the full article that will be published in "Shabbat" magazine.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The "Next Star" winner finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life •
"The song is about how to keep the connection from afar," he says
Tamir Greenberg in a second single called Into The Night after conquering the audience with his first single and his participation in "The Next Star".
In recent months, Greenberg has continued his many performances: Tel Aviv Cultural Hall, Tel Aviv Opera House, Shoni Amphitheater, Ganei Yehoshua Amphitheater, Hangar 11 and dozens of other performances.
The song Into The Night was produced and arranged by Greenberg together with producer Stav Bagger.
The video, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to memories of his childhood and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song is about the relationship between my father and me.
About the time I left Israel for the United States and the way to keep in touch from afar," Greenberg says.
In the coming month, Greenberg will appear at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and ahead of the new season of "The Next Star", the song with which he won the show, "Tell Me Where The Light Goes", was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Made in Blue and White: Yuval Shamla is the big winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world
The phenom climbed Mount Madoriyama in 26 seconds and won the title of "the first Israeli ninja" •
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of ninj.
the
There is a winner: Yuval Shamla conquered Midoriyama, and he is the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel" and now holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and the 16th in the world.
Shamla has been on the show since its first season, when he finished in first place, and in the second season, he lost to Gil Marantz.
He won again in the third season and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be the last season.
This evening he climbed Mount Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, beating the contestants Yogev Malka and Yishai Kalfon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished second.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season only one ninja who managed to climb the Midoriyama in time can be crowned.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, since Yuval Shamla, the winner of the season, climbed Midoriyama by 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the world title of ninja.
He could compete for it again next season.
Well, we understood, that full of superheroes, harnesses a perfect rock, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sporting event in the world
.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat in the finals of a reality show and acted as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet
.
Rotem Sela represents for us such a perfect feminine ideal that it is perverse to present it this way on television.
She earns more on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss on the spot and, when necessary, advocate for her business partner.
She is both a mother and a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads series and reality shows, and serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Sela goes through a screen that's too perfect, because the show she hosts has to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for it.
In the ninja world, everyone is larger than life, and the facilitators first.
After all, Assi Ezer was embroiled in an affair that was ostensibly supposed to erase him from the screen for a while, but since he is not an ordinary human being, he escaped from it even before the first batch of commercials.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who has broadcast European Cups and world records in his life, but is moved by a megawall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the final, two Olympic medalists (Yarden Jerbi and Linoy Ashram) sat next to him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high quality the conditions of entry into the superhuman world that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons.
"Ninja Israel" was blown out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Midoriyama and Yuval Shamla, who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned a ninja.
There he led an almost insurmountable trajectory, dropping down one after another all the superhuman characters for whom the show had inflated their egos throughout the year.
Want to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
Not with us.
This is where superheroes are being sought.
The emphasis was on searching for a successor to Shamla, the so-called "one-of-a-kind king of kings," and other nicknames meant to make it clear how perfect and one-of-a-kind he was.
As a result, the level of difficulty was raised, the girls who tried to compete on the tracks of the season crashed, and the boys competed among themselves who had more squares in their belly and the charisma of plywood to step into the shoes of the retiring Shamla.
They will say that this is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges, but for the vast majority of viewers - medium-sized couch potatoes like us - "Ninja Israel" cultivates for us an unattainable sports-achievement model.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gil Sassover oscillates between punches and conversations about holiness
It is strange to see the comedian, ex "Comedy Store", host of the "Kabbalat Shabbat" program on Channel 14, in which he tastes pots and gives a stage mainly to men
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question "What does the concept of 'preparing for Shabbat' remind you of?"
Say: sponge and cleaning, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi Kakhon on TV, but the strangest thing would be if someone suddenly said "Gil Sesover".
Because Gil Sassover in the middle of the sponge and cooking is as unrelated as television can offer.
Indeed, "Kabbalat Shabbat," the new program he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, is detached in spirit from the time it airs.
Along half of it - Sassover stands.
He speaks quickly, holding a microphone in his hand even when tasting dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punches and conversations about holiness.
In his defense, it should be said that the meager budget is felt, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also felt in the premiere program, which was broadcast yesterday from Mateh Binyamin, is a clear gender division.
The men sang, played, danced, spoke Torah, marketed restaurants and factories - while the women made do with a small item, in which they excitedly told about running a sewing workshop.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Kabbalat Shabbat with Gil Sesover, now 14
Assisted Living Association vs. Ruthie Russo: "To say 'it tastes like assisted living' harms our activity"
Chairwoman Yuli Gat sent a letter in which she expressed the union's complaint against what they claimed was an insulting statement by the judge of "The Next Restaurant" in one of the trailers for the show •
Ruti Russo responded: "Glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population."
The Association of Nursing Homes and Assisted Living in Israel against "The Next Restaurant": A letter sent by Chairwoman Yuli Gat and obtained by Israel Hayom reads as follows: "In the trailer before the broadcast, which was distributed on all social networks and television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said, 'Food tastes like assisted living,' that is, food of a closed institution with low-level food."
"The tone chosen by the show's judge, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food the contestant served immediately cancels our longstanding activity to fight against the ignorance that exists in the field, because the assisted living homes operate restaurants in the various homes for the benefit of the residents with chef dishes of the highest standard."
It added: "Service teams and home managers are struggling for the image of assisted living that offers quality housing solutions for the elderly, including alleviating loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living and more."
In Israel in recent years, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most difficult disease in old age and see community places as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of life's greatest joys, so we dedicate resources and efforts to serving residents the finest food.
Most assisted living facilities rely on professional chefs to build a menu.
We will be happy at any time to invite the judging panel in order to be impressed by the winning dishes served daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff in the assisted living homes, we will ask for your apology and clarification.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly."
Ruti Russo said in response: "Glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population, which definitely deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, chefs and chefs everywhere, even in assisted living facilities."
"Double standards: in Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer addressed criticism leveled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards •
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
"
Nick Cave canceled a concert in Russia earlier this week due to the war, declaring that he "stands with Ukraine and prays that the madness ends soon."
In doing so, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also cancelled shows in the invading country.
But in the case of Kyiv, his cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet accused the singer of being a hypocrite, since in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two concerts held in Israel, despite criticism from pro-Palestinian groups.
During his visit to Israel, Kyiv told local media: "At the end of the day, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."
The same Ahmet remembered well Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even posted a scathing post on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files," in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying state, and therefore the situation of Palestine is the same as that of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your announcement about Ukraine," Ahmet wrote. "The fact that you didn't support the Palestinians, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost responsible for Palestinian suffering.
It saddens me a lot, because you represent a double standard here," concluded the Turkish fan.
But the story does not end here, as Kyiv chose to respond to Ahmet with a long and detailed letter, in which he stressed that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first situation is a previous unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, hoping to change the security order of all of Europe.
The second situation is complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in bomb shelters.
I have great sympathy for all of these communities – no matter where they are or who they are."
Cave added that while he does not want to elaborate on his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supports the Palestinians as well, noting that over the past 20 years he has often participated in fundraising events for them.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Ahmet," the singer clarified, "this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, whose soil is currently experiencing a catastrophe.
I have great admirers in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them, I would."
In light of the decline in morbidity: The Corona Project will return to manage Ziv Hospital
Prof. Salman Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of dealing with COVID-19 in the third and fourth waves •
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as projector •
Prof. Zarka: "Glad that the Omicron wave continues to wane, and it is still our duty to prepare for another wave"
.
Against the background of the decline in coronavirus morbidity, the coronavirus projector, Prof. Salman Zarka, will return to manage Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as projector.
"I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to wane and that we have returned to our normal way of life," Prof. Zarka said, adding: "It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a result of the fact that the virus is still here, in Israel and around the world."
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of dealing with COVID-19 in the third and fourth waves.
As of May 1, Israel returned to a state of "between waves," which includes reducing most of the coronavirus systems, while maintaining its ability to conduct sequencing tests and investigations, which will serve as a basis for action in the event that a new variant is discovered.
Latent morbidity
A report by the National Information and Information Center for the Coronavirus Campaign, published this morning, noted that "there is a decline in the average of new confirmed cases to below 2,000 per day, on the weekly average, alongside a decline in the number of hospitalized and those hospitalized in serious condition."
However, they emphasized that "there is a significant amount of latent morbidity, and in practice the number of cases is much higher.
The number of institutional tests carried out in the community (without taking into account tests returning from abroad) is low, and stands at less than 20,000 tests on a weekly average only.
The low volume of testing makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends."
State Comptroller's Report: The actual budget in most years of activity of the Medicines Basket Committee is smaller than the recommended budget
According to Matanyahu Engelman's report, during more than 20 years of activity of the basket, the Ministry of Health did not supervise the committee's activity •
The report also states that the minutes of the meetings are published significantly late, if at all •
In addition, the Comptroller recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activities – and updating the basket's work procedures •
Another flaw found relates to the fact that since the committee began its activity, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the scope of uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket – which would have made it possible to analyze and control the budget given to them.
The Medicines Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and health.
Every year, the committee decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the health funds – but a new report by the State Comptroller published Tuesday warns that the company has been operating for more than 20 years without inspection reports on its activity and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervising and examining its activity.
Israel Hayom correspondent Ran Reznik adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing revelations in Israel Hayom about the failures of the basket of drugs.
According to Matanyahu Engelman's report, he recommends "making amendments and improvements in the process of expanding the basket that will lead to a higher quality utilization of the budget for the health services basket to which the public is entitled."
Throughout the existence of the mechanism for adding drugs to the basket, in 1998-2021, NIS 8 billion of drugs were added to the state budget, with the addition ranging from NIS 0 million to NIS 500 million annually.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, requests were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the healthcare basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated for expanding the basket was smaller than the volume of requests.
In most of the years of the committee's operation (90% of the time), the amount of the budget addition was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired rate of addition.
The Comptroller notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual addition in order to enable certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that "the model of transparency in the work of the basket is flawed."
Thus, for example, the Basket Committee's work procedure stipulates that the minutes of meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 109-160 days, and sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in publishing the protocols undermines the transparency of decisions; As a result, the ability of the bidders – patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies – to submit re-applications as soon as possible and relevant may be impaired, after they have learned lessons from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and amended their proposals, and reassessed the feasibility of receiving them in the next round," the comptroller noted in the report.
"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the timetables set out in the procedure."
Out of thousands of submissions, only one economic comment was submitted
Another criticism of Engelman concerns a preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the basket of drugs.
The comptroller found that about half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.
Another flaw concerns the activity of the subcommittee of the Basket of Drugs, which is closed to the media and the public, and in which patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The Comptroller recommends adding a public representative or examining the possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without confidential commercial details.
The procedure according to which the Health Services Basket Committee operates states that "an economic assessment must be submitted" to a request to add a drug to the basket.
In practice, however, over the years, only one economic assessment out of thousands of submissions has been submitted, and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, requests were submitted to the Basket Committee for 2019-2021 to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report found that the requests were not accompanied by economic estimates, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing the damage caused by obesity-related diseases or due to the ability to avoid gastric shortening surgeries.
It also emerges that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparations for treating the growth of chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The Comptroller also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the health funds have also been included in the basket of medicines, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines provided by the Ministry of Health (the "Third Addendum").
The legal framework for this step is regulated only retroactively.
In the past six years, NIS 74 million of the addition to the basket of medicines has been used for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the procedures for the work of the basket and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the basket are defined as "drugs at no additional cost", the use of which does not cost the health funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The Comptroller suggests examining the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and shortened track, so that the basket of drugs can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no supervision of the use of especially expensive drugs.
The audit also shows that since the work of the Basket Committee began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds to report and has not supervised the scope of uses and utilization of drugs in the basket, information that could have enabled the Ministry to analyze and control the budget given to the health plans.
Over the years, only two reports relating to the years 2006-2009 have been published, and these too were published with considerable delay (the last one was published this year and dealt with the utilization of the budget in 2007-2009).
"The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, irrelevance of the conclusions arising from the examination after such a long period, subcommittee suboptimal pricing, and decision making based on tentative findings," the report said.
In addition, the Ministry also does not audit and supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not conducted lessons learned.
These 10 drugs constituted 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2016-2021).
On this, the comptroller wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use compared to the estimates.
Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the Basket Committee and the Subcommittee, and about how the estimates are prepared when pricing drugs and technologies and improve them."
"Shocking and incomprehensible": stormy discussion in the Health Committee on the poisoning at Beit Dafna
The measurements of the first patient who died were normal ten minutes before her death •
Committee Chairman Silman: "If the people there cared that the kitchen was like home, it wouldn't look like that."
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old woman from the Beit Dafna residence in Holon died of food poisoning, she was given medical measures that were normal, she claimed Tuesday at a hearing of the health committee.
"We have night caregivers who check in during the night and there's a nurse who makes rounds.
There have been several reports of cases of diarrhea and the same resident actually the last time her measurements were taken was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was monitored like the other Dickers with diarrhea.
She is a nursing patient, we went to get a manuch to assist with her transfer and then that resident did not respond.
We started CPR and called the nurse," the director described what happened last Sunday morning at the center.
This was an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized, and a total of about a quarter of the residents of the hostel (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea to eat contaminated goulash meat.
The director of the daycare center made the remarks against the backdrop of claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Nuss, head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, said: "We cannot determine unequivocally why the three residents died.
Only blood tests were taken from them."
The hearing also revealed that even from the residents who were hospitalized, it was no longer possible to obtain a stool sample because they did not have diarrhea, and therefore it was not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
An engineer on behalf of the Ministry of Health also noted that "the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary condition of kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs or a request to renew a license."
The Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Affairs admitted that the commission of inquiry has not yet been appointed for this case and a previous case of abuse against Hosim that occurred three months ago at the B'nai Zion institution in the Sharon region.
Health Committee Chairwoman MK Idit Silman said during the discussion: "If people there cared that the kitchen be like home, it wouldn't look like it.
The residents in the welfare dormitories need more.
They are health sensitive and need extra supervision and care.
It is shocking and incomprehensible what happened there.
The terrible findings that were discovered were even after they knew that the Ministry of Health had come to check.
Where is the supervision and responsibility of the ministries?
How is it that ministers and directors general of ministries are not present in such a discussion to explain what is happening here?"
Yigal Nachomi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who manages the daycare center and even managed the center himself, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire system stand up with only one goal: to do good for people.
The people who died were people I personally cared for.
I put one of the residents to sleep.
It's a shocking event for us."
Smadar Una, a former resident of a daycare center her age, snapped at him and said, "Enough with the lies and nice words.
I was there."
Gali Barmi, the parents' representative at Akim Israel: "We have complained in the past about the food and did not accept the criticism."
Oren Hellman, founder of the Equal Chance for the Integration of People with Disabilities project, protested that the names of the deceased residents were not published: "Their names are not even known.
Are they worth less?
Our children's lives are being disrespected."
Suspected Wolfson failure: the surgeon caused a heart rupture - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Feras Abu Aker as director of the hospital's Thoracic Surgery Unit •
The chairman of the doctors' committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, had been warned before his appointment
Hospital: "He is valued and experienced"
First publication: A horrific mistake occurred at the Wolfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during surgery the doctor ruptured the patient's heart, leading to his tragic death.
The operation on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient took place on 19 April.
This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Feras Abu Aker at the hospital, after he was appointed director of Wolfson's Thoracic Surgery Unit.
During the operation, which was designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large rupture of the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the death of the patient.
But the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised serious questions regarding the management of the hospital.
The director of the oncology institute and chairman of the doctors' committee, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation into the affair in a letter he sent to the hospital's director, Dr. Anat Engel.
In the letter, he raised very serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Aqer, after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, was transferred to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
A huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient has been lucid, functioning and cared for for the past four years.
Recently, he had a spread of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid was discovered inside the pericardium, which contains the heart muscle.
Also, surgeon Dr. Abu Aker was impressed that he could perform the operation.
According to the complaint, the surgery had a serious malfunction, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, head of Wolfson's cardiothoracic surgery department, who was operating on a child in the next room at the time, "was rushed to the operating table and saw a huge hole in his heart."
He said the heart was drained of blood, blood pressures were zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu Aker was not professionally and personally suited to run the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and even though he was supposed to be the direct director of the chest surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without sharing it and accepted Dr. Abu Aker for the position.
He added: "This is an uncomplicated procedure that lasted several minutes," adding: "It is impossible not to relate to the flawed process of accepting Dr. Abu Aker for the position.
The question arises whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the operation and the patient's death."
Experienced surgeon
Israel Hayom was presented with information and claims by other senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised by Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint, writing that Dr. Abu Aker is "one of the most experienced surgeons in Israel, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon."
He added that he was chosen in a proper tender and that Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his declarations of his desire to "disconnect" from the chest unit.
He added: "I wasn't involved in the proceedings either, and maybe I should have been.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Feras Abu Aker began working on 10 April and is entitled to 100 days of grace, "All the doctors in the hospital were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of cases of a similar procedure, and unfortunately the present case ended as it did unfortunately.
Wolfson Hospital said in response: "We share in the family's grief.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The chest surgeon mentioned in the article is a respected surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in a tender to manage the thoracic surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, his quoted words are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very serious condition.
The hospital is examining the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case."

A model for healing: three senior doctors talk about their mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, especially during the pandemic •
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh does not forget, even from the height of his position, the push from the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik •

Three key hospital officials write about those who inspired and encouraged them to be better, both as caregivers and as human beings.
Three senior doctors, three teachers of life and profession: On the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, Israel Hayom invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to recall the figures who accompanied them at the beginning and helped them become who they are today.
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of Sheba's Infectious Diseases Unit |
About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira
The encounter that opened my eyes - and changed my life
Had I not met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the infectious diseases unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained an internal medicine specialist.
He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue it.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, back in the 1980s.
For a moment I did not think that I would leave the inner one, as I loved the treatment of the patient himself; But Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also expressed in neurology, internal medicine, and in fact in every field.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
All along, I've loved his investigative approach, one that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything thoroughly.
He was a genuine and honest person, devoid of ego, qualities that I loved very much about him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was my role model and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go to medicine—but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapiro.
Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors still use today - for example, "tissue iz de ishio", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the affected organ makes it possible to know which medicines should be given; Or "Won Yu Hughes It, Yu Luz It," which is meant to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked at Hadassah and had two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at shiva, I cried.
He was something - a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his serious illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to deal with epidemics, and he is sorely missed during this period.
If he were with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted with him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the epidemic response team.

About the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
.
I first met the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik when I was a student in my fourth year of medical studies, and I came to a rotation in internal medicine in the Department of Internal Medicine D, which he managed.
Later on, I returned to the department as part of my sixth year, and I did my medical school final thesis under his supervision, writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).
Saul influenced every major juncture in my professional life over the course of 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my image as a doctor; Not only professionally, but also - and most importantly - personally and humanly.
During my internship, I debated between family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about choosing a specialization.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him at Soroka.
During my internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways – scientific writing (sorry Saul, I didn't persist enough), connecting with patients, working in a multidisciplinary team – an area in which the department excelled – and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, as a doctor and as a manager, I recognize characteristics that come from Saul.
When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go abroad for a period of study, Shaul pushed and directed me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.
The training period was a very important time for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and push, I'm not sure it would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital management, Shaul was again the one who supported and assisted.
Later on, we went through complex periods together in the Internal Medicine Division.
Shaul knew how to integrate the teacher, principal, friend and teammate wonderfully, without his different roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to be as successful as he is in this special combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns who are now present throughout the Israeli medical system, perpetuating his memory and work with their excellent work.
I am honored to be part of this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of Schneider Children's Medical Center |
About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at Schneider Children's Medical Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that, he taught me to think.
The obvious thing I learned from him was to take care of the most complex, sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but it's the obvious.
But I learned even more meaningful and profound things from him.
Looking back, because I am a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, it is clear to me today that the connection between the two worlds is clear; The education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: listen to children, listen to monitors, listen to nurses, care teams young and old alike, and listen to parents.
All this must be done not only in order to communicate more correctly and successfully, but in order to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in the treatment of children exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and dialogue stimulate deeper understanding, both on the part of the treating staff and on the part of patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at an entire system.
The deeper and more rigorous understanding there is, which integrates all the caregivers into the discourse, the more precise the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and most importantly - early enough to prevent future, immediate or distant damage.
That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He is a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and precisely, to listen - and then to apply.

Medical Malpractice at Various Stages of Birth
In order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence
Childbirth is one of the happiest and most exciting events in the life of a family.
Unfortunately, however, sometimes births end in serious damage caused to the mother or newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where the birth ended in physical injury, either to the newborn or to the mother, it is appropriate to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in medical malpractice will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, if he sees fit, will consult with a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during labor do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.
When, then, is it negligence?
When the doctor's error was due to incompetence or deviation from the reasonable level of care, and the incompetence and deviation from the acceptable level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused had the doctor not acted in this way.
In this article we will examine the different stages of birth, explain the complications that may occur at each stage and when they amount to medical malpractice.
Phase of contractions
The contraction phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (in order to allow the passage of the fetus at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most cases of medical malpractice during labor involve failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes even expressed in cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy may be caused by failure to recognize or delay in identifying perinatal asphyxia, which manifests itself in a failure to supply oxygen to the fetus' brain tissue.
In general, monitoring the mother's condition and correctly interpreting the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical staff to act quickly and rescue the newborn before he is irreversibly injured.
Cases in which the medical staff ignores signs indicating that the fetus suffers from a lack of oxygen or that the staff does not correctly interpret the data before it, especially the fetal monitor, or reacts late to the distress expressed in the monitor – may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy may also be caused by umbilical cord prolapse and uterine rupture that was not detected in time.
Even in these difficult events, it is worth clarifying whether the medical staff acted properly.
For example, Adv. Anna Reif Ligenza, of Caspi Srour & Co., a law firm specializing in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her firm handled a claim of a child who was injured during birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the fetus' head was too high, thereby leading to umbilical cord prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetus' head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure from the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and to his being born with severe neurological damage.
In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to gross medical negligence on the part of the staff of the maternity ward at a large hospital, which during the birth did not identify clear signs in time that required a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of her previous pregnancy.
The fetus, which was ejected through the rupture in its mother's uterus into the abdominal cavity, suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage, on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during childbirth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
We emphasize that in order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the asphyxiation and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused as a result of such negligence and not due to any other reason or cause.
The causal relationship will be examined by examining medical indices that, according to the medical literature, only when there is a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.
Among other things, the indicators of the pH level in the fetus' blood, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage, and more are examined.
Death of the fetus
Active birth phase
The stage of active birth begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical phase.
Delay in childbirth and avoidance of performing a cesarean section
In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, that is, lack of progression of the process of active birth.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.
"There are cases in which failure to perform a cesarean section on time may cause irreversible damage to the fetus," Attorney Reif-Ligenza explained to us.
"For example, we conducted a medical malpractice lawsuit for maternal death caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.
Contrary to any known medical practice, the medical staff failed to identify the fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the particularly slow progression of the birth.
The delay in performing the surgery caused systemic damage to the birth rate, which eventually led to her death shortly after birth."
Negligence in vacuum birth
In situations where the mother or fetus faces significant danger that requires a particularly rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.
In this process, a "dome" is vacuumed to the fetus' head and the fetus is forcefully pulled out.
Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great care, precision and skill.
In these cases, medical malpractice may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory guidelines and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for longer than permitted or when despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more than the permitted number of attempts.
In these cases, if the negligent vacuum operation caused damage to the newborn – among other things, it may cause cranial damage and hemorrhages that may cause the development of brain damage – there is room to file a tort claim.
ERB palsy
Erb's palsy is a congenital nerve injury to the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is worth checking whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric staff.
The injury is manifested by weakness of the hand muscles and can reach complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a "shoulder dislocation" - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus' shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after the head has come out.
When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical malpractice?
In cases where the weight assessment of the fetus indicated that it is a macrosomic fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kilograms and according to the guidelines, it is better to deliver the mother by cesarean section.
When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a cesarean section should be considered in light of risk factors, including gestational diabetes and prolongation of the second stage of birth.
If the medical staff ignores an abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder rupture and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical malpractice.
Indeed, in Civil Appeal 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a concern that it will occur, is to perform a cesarean section."
Placental exit phase
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the exit of the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.
In most cases, the process lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby leaves and usually takes place spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the placenta exits, the medical staff will check whether it has come out intact or whether parts of the placenta remain in the uterus.
During this stage, complications may occur that can cause serious damage to the mother.
One of the well-known complications as a result of placental residues remaining in the uterus is called Asherman syndrome, scarring of the uterine wall as a result of inflammation caused by placental residues remaining in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that makes it impossible to implant a pregnancy.
Therefore, in cases where the medical staff did not identify placental residues or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the uterine lining despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, this may be medical malpractice and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
Death of the mother
The death of a mother during childbirth is quite rare.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical staff does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or responds late to the bleeding as stated.
"For example...", Adv. Reif-Ligneza told us, "our firm filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a mother, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the mother's worrisome vital signs for many hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the background disease from which she suffered."
"In another case...", said Adv. Reif-Ligneza, "our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after the birth of twins due to bleeding originating in the cesarean section incision that was not properly sewn.
In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, reacted late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death."
Loss of uterus
In severe cases, medical malpractice in childbirth may lead to hysterectomy, says Adv. Reif Lingze: "Our firm conducted a lawsuit against a hospital based on hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.
In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to the lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after the birth, yet no timely actions were taken that could have prevented the damage."
What are the damages awarded in claims for medical malpractice in childbirth?
Neonatal compensation for injury due to medical malpractice in childbirth includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and suffering, nursing and wage care, wage and pension losses to the victim and even to his parents, and other components of damage.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.
In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation devices, the cost of adjusting housing to the baby's needs, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances," says Adv. Reif-Liganza, and she adds that "today most claims on the grounds of medical malpractice end in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in conducting the proceeding," but the lawyer added that "there are cases in which the proceeding ends only with a judgment, in which case if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages, and for example,  As part of a lawsuit conducted by our firm, the District Court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation exceeding ten million shekels."
Finally
Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney skilled in managing claims on the grounds of medical malpractice, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of keratoconus eye disease in the south
A study found that there is a link between the development of the disease and the marriage of relatives •
The highest prevalence was found in the Bedouin sector •
Expert: "It is possible that in any sector with many weddings between cousins, a high incidence of the disease was found."
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes several visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and to find correct solutions to prevent the condition from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted to help understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide research support for the suspicion that keratoconus is a genetic disease.
A recent study, which dealt with the transformation of the cornea from a dome to a cone, revealed that the cause of the cornea's disease and weakness and deformation of its shape is related to an enzyme imbalance, due to which free radicals can damage the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The source of this enzyme deficiency is genetic, reinforcing the hypothesis that keratoconus is an inherited disease.
According to Prof. Ariella Gordon-Shag, Head of the Department of Optometry Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, "In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of keratoconus of 3.2% was found.
The highest prevalence was among students from the Bedouin sector – 20% had keratoconus, but there was a relatively small sample."
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: "There is a large prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that marriage of relatives is a risk factor for keratoconus.
So in any sector with a lot of weddings between cousins, we may find a high prevalence."
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where a family history of keratoconus disease appears, all family members should undergo an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.
According to Erza Fruchter, a clinical optometrist at the B.Sc, "There is a tenfold increase in referral to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, mainly from the south, as opposed to the center."
Fruchter adds, "Over the past decade, I have noticed that most patients turn from the periphery, especially from the Be'er Sheva area.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriage within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of proper handling of the problem."
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or late teens (ages 15-16 or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, in parallel with an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients indicate distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease may also develop rapidly and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many patients also report increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the operation in Gaza, the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M.; Bennett: "Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel"
Mahmoud Kheir a-Din from the village of Hurfeish is a lieutenant colonel killed in an operation in Khan Yunis •
Director of Military Intelligence: "He deserves publicity, his family and his children" •
Later, the possibility of publishing the photo of Lt. Col. Emanuel Moreno from the General Staff unit will be examined
About three and a half years after the operation that got into trouble in Khan Yunis, the IDF today allows publication that the person killed in the operation, Lt. Col. M., was Lt. Col. Mahmoud Kheir a-Din from the village of Hurfeish in the north.
He was 41.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "It has been three and a half years since the late Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Khair Al-Din fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the state.
"The late Mahmoud was a soldier in a paratrooper reconnaissance unit and later rose through the ranks of the army to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's special operations unit.
Hero of Israel who was posthumously decorated with the Chief of Staff's citation."
He added: "I eulogized him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and face of the hero of Israel, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Khair Al-Din, openly.
The environment looked up to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has forbidden the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the Intelligence Directorate, Major General Aharon Haliwa, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Kheir a-Din, Hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Hurfeish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of Ahmad and a nun, and has seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahed and had two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the Special Operations Directorate of the Intelligence Directorate.
Throughout his life, Khair ad-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him.
Until the ninth grade, he attended school in Kfar Hurfeish, and then transferred to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997 he enlisted in a paratrooper patrol, and in 2000 he graduated from the officers' school.
In 2002 he was located by the Special Operations Directorate of Military Intelligence and went to serve there.
During his service, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002 he met his wife, Nahed, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010 he joined the Acharei association and began guiding a group in Kfar Hurfeish, after making sure that the association began operating in Druze villages in order to encourage youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
The head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliwa, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "For some time now we have been reversing the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Kheir a-Din, a hero of Israel.
We finished our work and came to the conclusion that there was no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.
He also deserves it, his family and his children," he said.
"Outstanding educator and leader"
"Thanks to many operations, he is no less than a hero in my eyes," said Maj. Gen. Haliwa.
"He has made a significant contribution, with courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He deserves to get the place that suits him."
He added: "I didn't know him personally, but he was an exceptional educator, educator and leader – not only on the operational side, but also in my values."
Maj. Gen. Haliva noted that in the future he would also examine whether to publish the photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emanuel Moreno of Sayeret Matkal, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not permitted to be published.
The operation in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of many months of meticulous preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
The operation's command squad consisted of then-IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, then-Director of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heiman, and then-ISA Director Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been made public, and the IDF stressed that it was an operation whose intelligence value was invaluable.
But the Arab media retroactively presented communications equipment that, according to the Palestinians, had been left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was intended to plant listening devices.
According to reports, on the day of the incident, the force was traveling in two vehicles.
The fighters were detained at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas operatives, and something about their behavior aroused the suspicions of Hamas operatives.
The operatives surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The interrogation on the ground lasted about 45 minutes, during which time it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair a-Din managed to distract the Hamas members, and in that split second, the commander of the force, Lt. Col. A., managed to open fire.
Three Hamas members were killed in the fire, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair a-Din.
Ten months after the horrific incident, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi decided to accept the recommendation of the IDF Citation Committee and award the Chief of Staff citation to three of the fighters in the incident deep inside the Gaza Strip – including the late Lt. Col. Khair a-Din.
The commander of the combat force and another member of the crew also received citations.
The army's announcement said at the time that Lt. Col. M. received the citation for "his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, in defense of his comrades.
Subsequently, he acted out of initiative and striving for contact, took a forward role in taking control of the enemy and acted resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider switching from tweezers operations to large-scale operations
Israel must ask itself, once again, whether it is wrong to change its policy vis-à-vis the Jenin sector •
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank, but Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
The stormy weekend we went through shows that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the terrain is still more volatile than ever.
It will take great effort and common sense to safely cross the two upcoming commemoration dates: Nakba Day, which falls today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day, which will be marked in two weeks.
Quite a few elements will stand by in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
Chief among them, as always, are the terrorist elements, which are concentrating a special effort on trying to maintain the violent atmosphere of recent weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which SWAT soldier Maj. Noam Raz was killed yesterday.
Fighters who took part in the battle in Jenin testified that they do not remember such a scale of shooting and violence – a testament not only to the enormous amount of weapons on the ground, but also to the willingness to use them.
This requires Israel to ask itself, once again, whether it is wrong to change its policy vis-à-vis the Jenin sector and move from small, intelligence-based tweezers operations to a large-scale, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena; Even now, the defense establishment prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid incendiary, but the Jenin militants may leave it no choice.
Draw the lessons for future events.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims to have deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.
Operational activity is dangerous for those who participate in it, and for those present at the scene.
The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of combatants.
This indicates high morality, but it also has operational-intelligence value: a terrorist caught alive – as happened yesterday in Jenin – is an excellent source of information about weapons, attacks and other terrorists; This is information that usually cannot be obtained in any other way, and through which future attacks can be thwarted.
The IDF acted correctly when it published its interim investigation into Abu Akleh's death on Monday, clarifying that it is not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the affair.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince those who are convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terror – the original pretext for which the IDF is constantly operating in Jenin.
As always, the nature of such stories is dying out.
World public opinion is busy and moving on, especially as a much more intense war continues to rage in Ukraine.
Therefore, it is a shame that Israel insisted on giving the affair of Abu Akleh's death more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu Akleh's family did not meet the preliminary agreements, one should have expected a little more restraint from the police officers accompanying the funeral procession, and certainly less moved by the Palestinian flags waving there.
Responsibility requires: act to calm the situation.
The Public Security Minister and the Police Commissioner did well to order an investigation into the incident.
It seems to lack sufficient preparation and clear instructions, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
In the Dizengoff attack, too, the police failed to manage the incident, isolate the scene and handle the media.
The commission of inquiry would do well not only to analyze the conduct of the police officers at the funeral itself, but also to draw conclusions and conclusions that will enable better handling of similar incidents in the future.
Alongside the internal handling of the police, it is also necessary to consider the conduct of elected officials who have lost their way and direction.
The Israeli Knesset currently has several members who appear to be a danger to democracy.
They are on both the left and the right, and exploit their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kasif is the latest example; If no action is taken against him – including prosecution for assaulting a police officer – the state will implicitly encourage the next elected official to further radicalize his actions.
Such measures, which are a defensive democracy, are essential in the volatility of this period, against the background of elements seeking to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with common sense in his head is expected to rise above all this, and act to calm the situation; Otherwise, Israel could quickly slide into escalation against external enemies and, worse, internal adversaries.
Senior Police Official: "Government Policy and Goal Setting Are Needed Here"
The Israel Police has indeed launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal aliens, but there is still a long way to go •
There is no single entity in the State of Israel today that integrates this whole issue."
"If we want to deal with the phenomenon of illegal aliens, government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities must be derived.
Today there is not a single entity in the State of Israel that integrates this whole issue," a senior police official told Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon was reflected in some 20,000-30,000 NIS people entering every day through the gaps in the fence.
In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel daily through 34 supervised crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each industry is limited by the quota set by the political echelon in accordance with the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the District Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, the ISA is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to terrorist attacks, but in many cases Palestinians whose entry is denied because they do not meet the permitted quota of permits.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were considered prisoners, but were not supervised because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security officials to monitor their movements.
"Therefore, their entry through the gaps in the fence is meaningless," says a senior security source, "Anyone who wants to carry out an attack can also enter Israel through the supervised crossings, and there have been such cases in the past.
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of the large number of warnings of terrorist attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal aliens.
By the end of the week, some 16,000 prisoners had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were interrogated and criminal cases were opened, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the police prosecution policy, proceedings against an illegal alien are carried out only against prone criminals or repeaters of the act (recidivists).
An illegal alien who was arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the Occupied Territories.
Sometimes this is repeated the second time, but only the third time is he arrested, imprisoned and indicted for illegal stay.
According to the law, if an illegal alien is caught within 50 to 100 meters on each side of the separation fence, he is handled by the military prosecution.
Figures obtained by Israel Hayom show that in 2021, the police dealt with 40,010 illegal aliens, transporters and accomodators.
7,405 illegal aliens were arrested and a criminal case was opened for 19,533.
The number of employers, transporters and accomplices handled by police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
"The foundations of the IPS phenomenon do not depend on the police, not the IDF, not Israeli society and not Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors," says a senior law enforcement official.
"In order to deal with the phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be sterilized, and on the Israeli side, a price must be charged to prevent them from crossing the fence.
Sources involved in the matter claim that the failure to charge the price stems, among other things, from the lack of places of detention and the fact that arrests are carried out only when there are related offenses or the recidivist is involved.
Legal sources argue that the decision to charge a price only from the beginning of his third arrest was made in part because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests carried out every day.
Whoever examines the punishment will find that it does not deter."
There is great complexity
The Shin Bet," says a police source, "is a complex person."
He can be the father of a family who enters the country to work in order to earn a few shekels and return.
This is the basic platform, and on it are dressed many types of prisoners who enter the country in order to carry out criminal offenses or attacks."
The IPS can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, the police caught illegal aliens aged 16 and even children aged 8 and 10 being sent by their parents to intersections on the roads, in order to earn a few shekels a day from drivers.
"It also makes the matter complicated, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and indict them for neglect," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed illegal aliens in garbage removal, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 crossings, there are about 18 central crossings.
There are crossings for vehicles and goods, there are crossings through which only people pass and there are crossings that are both.
All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.
The ISAs are usually transported into the country by private drivers, since this is easy money.
"There are those who do it for a living, and there are gangs whose main occupation is transporting prisoners," says a senior police official, "usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can range from 100 shekels to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies don't deal with this, because if the company is caught, it is doomed to shut down."
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting prisoners can be considered an offense.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who collects Palestinians at organized points and at fixed times, including orderly orders, is not breaking the law," says a senior police official.
Most of these guys drive with a Chukmak car because they know their car is being confiscated, so they prefer to drive an old car."

"A criminal investigation should be opened against her": Haifa City Comptroller on serious charges against Einat Kalish Rotem
The City Comptroller's report presents an alleged concern about criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials and political opponents: surveillance of employees and an inflated payment to an accountant's office for carrying out investigations •
"The harsh findings arising from the report necessitate the opening of a criminal investigation" •
Haifa Municipality did not respond to a request for comment.
Surveillance of municipal employees and political opponents and an inflated payment to an accounting firm for conducting investigations, "at the expense of the public purse."
Haifa Municipality Comptroller Ofer Tal's report, published Tuesday, presents alleged concern about criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
Kalish allegedly met with the accounting firm Barlev & Co. and requested an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former city treasurer, and a code name given to Councilwoman Sophie Nakash, examining whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash's family were strictly legitimate.
The auditor's report also shows that there is disorder and complete lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose job is to coordinate and synchronize the accountant's work and municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant has not been transferred to him.
This has caused no one in the municipality to be aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what scope of work is required in each of them.
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation was created in which the scope of issues in which the accountant was involved increased disproportionately, with great interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring on the part of the municipality.
In conclusion, the audit recommended stopping the outstanding payments to the accountant until material detailing his work on each of the issues he examined was received.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were subject to codes such as "gatekeepers", information store, fish shop, investigative audit of the mayor and procurement forensic audit report.
A short time later, the municipality's attorney, Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor herself signed the payment authorization in her place.
"I have not been commissioned by any audit report and I do not know what it is about," she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remained to be paid from the tax money of the Haifa public.
Former City Treasurer Jackie Wakim responded: "These despicable actions carried out for the purpose of tarnishing my name and the name of elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the Haifa taxpayer are a criminal offense."
City Council member Sophie Nakash responded: "The comptroller's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves."
Haifa City Council Member Sarit Golan's response: The testimonies and harsh findings arising from the report necessitate the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in employing the Investigative Review Advisor to carry out investigations, some of which are doubtful whether they are permitted by law in the manner in which they were carried out, and in particular the investigations concerning the opposition council member to the mayor and former senior employees."
Lior Datz of the "Gatekeepers" association responded: "It seems that all the red lines have been crossed that a public authority sends private investigators in order to collect information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption and while the association conducts public proceedings against the Haifa municipal administration."
Haifa Municipality did not respond to a request for comment.
The accounting firm Yehuda Barlev did not wish to comment.
Gantz revealed: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm UNIFIL's activity in Lebanon"
The defense minister participated in the international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their modus operandi."
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Al-Sayed being held captive by Hamas: "A video aimed at blackmail – on the back of a humanitarian issue"
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems"
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke Wednesday morning at the international cyber conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University, where he revealed a joint Iranian-Hezbollah attack to hit UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country," Gantz said.
Gantz referred among other things to the documentation of Hisham Al-Sayed, held captive by Hamas in Gaza, released by the terrorist organization's military wing: "Yesterday a video was released aimed at blackmail – on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four boys captive in violation of international law, contrary to morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal conduct by Hamas."
He added, "The State of Israel is working through a variety of means, and continues to turn every stone in order to bring the boys home.
As we have said in the past, this is a humanitarian issue, this is how we see it, and on this basis we will continue to act.
Attempts at blackmail and cognitive exercises will not affect our position and conduct."
He later revealed joint Iranian-Hezbollah activity: "Iran also operates its proxies in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recently activity of Iranian security agencies in cooperation with Hezbollah was detected in order to harm the activity of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This was done by carrying out a cyber operation whose objective was to steal materials about UNIFIL's deployment in the area, and their use by Hezbollah.
This is another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon, and to Lebanon's stability."
"Israel is familiar with its adversaries' cyber systems and their modus operandi.
In recent years, we have seen a phenomenon of Iranian hacker groups operating against Israel and other countries," Gantz continued.
"The 'new emissaries' are terrorists with keyboards who are doomed like fighters of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we harm them and their senders, and even today they are in our crosshairs – and not only in the cyber dimension.
No attack on Israeli citizens will be on the agenda.
And the responsibility lies with the attackers and with the state that funds and sends them.
A cyberattack can be answered in a variety of ways in cyberspace and other spaces."
Gantz continued his attack on the nuclear power: "Iran is leading cyber terrorism – and is taking steps aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the US presidential elections and other attempts of which Israel is aware.
Operations such as that of the Shahid Kaveh unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations, and industrial plants in a number of countries, were carried out under the direct directive of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards, as revealed in the investigations."
He added, "In recent years, we have blocked many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber responsibility' and punish companies and entities that do not act in accordance with the guidelines."
Gantz went on to outline Israel's next objectives in the face of the threats: "Our supreme mission, in the army, in the various industries and security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have set this issue as one of the main tasks in the relevant units.
We are constantly examining force buildup – both in terms of manpower, training and missions.
In the coming years, we will also need to examine the way cyber warfare is organized, managed, and operated, with its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and in the defense establishment as a whole."
Finally, the defense minister concluded by calling for cooperation with the world: "There is great importance to our cooperation with the world vis-à-vis Iran in the cyber dimension as well.
The same cooperation that we are building in the region vis-à-vis Iran in terms of defense against various threats – we are also expanding in the cyber dimension."
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems."
Uri, deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit's first public appearance at such conferences, revealing that Israel had thwarted an attack on the water systems.
"Preventing cyber threats is a key part of our operations.
Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and to act to negate his capabilities," said the deputy commander of 8200, adding, "This is how sometimes we also find victims outside of Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and by collaborating with industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed."
As stated, this exposed a threat to Israel's water systems and attempts to poison Israeli citizens: "We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them several years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a certain adversary attacked Israel, and in the process we identified that the same attacker was also trying to target power plants in the United States.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We were able to prevent this threat through close cooperation with our American partners."

Preparing for the next attack: A series of terror attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, in which 19 people were murdered and about 70 civilians were wounded, led the Border Police to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to charge terrorists within the civilian population and shoot in motion.
Israel Hayom Exposed: A Glimpse into the Assaf Facility
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary for the normal life of the civilian population.
The severe wave of terrorist attacks that took place this year, with attacks in Be'er Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel and Elad, and especially the one that took place at the beginning of April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who assimilated into a crowd, led the police to think creatively in order to develop a tool that could be used to train fighters to attack terrorists within the civilian population.
The work of thinking was led by the training division of the police and the Border Police.
They launched a competition in the various police districts under the title "Commanders Lead Learning," in which each district was required to develop measures that would help improve the policing and combat skills of the fighters, police officers and commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need to train Border Police fighters for combat in motion shooting training and in such scenarios, Assaf Ben David, a Border Police counterterrorism instructor near Jerusalem, developed the "Assaf Facility", which consists of a dynamic target, connected to a telescopic pole on which a carrier can be harnessed to the instructor.
Their servant guides the carrier to his waist, he can practice the warrior standing in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Policemen and women have dealt with many attacks in which the perpetrator shoots and poses a threat while moving in arenas saturated with innocent civilians.
"Assaf facility", in its current version, is based on components and parts used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic rod that was upgraded and integrated into the facility was taken from the field of maintenance and cleaning.
Using the device, it is possible to simulate shooting in motion within a civilian population at a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling traffic stops, choosing a path of progress, performing selective fire, including practicing preventing harm to uninvolved civilians.
Major Assaf Ben David, after whom the facility is named, says: "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in learning and training combatants and police officers.
The development provides a relevant response to the reference threats and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of development in the face of the relatively cheap cost of production is a significant advantage for us in competition."
State Comptroller Warns: "The Central Elections Committee Is Not Prepared for Cyber Threats"
Matanyahu Engelman warned at International Cyber Week about Israel's lack of preparedness for hacker attacks •
"World War III will be a hacker war, but the world is not prepared for it."
State Comptroller Matanyahu Engelman participated today (Wednesday) in Tel Aviv University's annual cyber conference and expressed concern about cyberattacks on Israel.
"We are exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it."
Engelman said that as part of the cyber audits conducted by his office, significant flaws were found: "Over the past year, we conducted penetration tests at the traffic management center in Jerusalem, hospitals and the Tax Authority's systems.
In the audits, we found significant flaws, including the fact that very few penetration tests were performed by public bodies and some conducted penetration tests only during the audit.
In addition, there were deficiencies in the Central Elections Committee's preparedness for cyber threats."
"We at the State Comptroller's Office are committed to continue to address this significant issue even more vigorously, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world," he concluded.
Aim high: "I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles"
The choice of Reds: "From the first moment they showed me that they wanted me, I am built to lead a big team" •
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: "I felt I had a place, wanted to be in the squad for EuroBasket"
And the time at Maccabi Tel Aviv: "I learned to concentrate only on what is in my control" •
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will travel today with the players of the Israeli national team to Poland, where they will meet the local team in the 2023 World Championship qualifiers (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia at the Shlomo Group Arena.
In addition to the intensive training with the national team, Blazer also dealt with his future over the past week, until he signed for two years with Hapoel Jerusalem.
"I have peace of mind now that I've found a team," he told Israel Hayom in his first special interview since signing.
"I have a bit of pressure now because I have to move with my family after we settled in the central area and it's not easy, but there are no phones anymore and professionally I'm much calmer."
You haven't been with the national team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to enjoy the national team and I come with the attitude of contributing as much as I can, whether it's from my experience or on the pitch.
Of course I would love to play, but when it comes to the national team, everyone has to put their egos aside and do everything possible for the team to succeed.
I'm here for whatever they need from me."
Now you are 14 players, and the European Championship will be joined by Dani Avdía, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and there may be other changes.
Have you made it your goal to be in the squad for the championship?
"I'd love to be on the pitch and contribute."
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99m) has played for Maccabi Tel Aviv for the past two years.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring Jerusalemites to Hapoel Holon.
You had other suggestions, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
"They showed great willingness for me to be there, so there were relatively easy negotiations.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach I realized this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and appropriate to me.
I come to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I've spoken to the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and winning, and that's exactly what I bring.
I've always loved playing at the Arena, because I get energized even if the crowd is against me, and now that they'll be on my side it will be even better.
I'm sure it's going to be a committed and fun team and I wanted to be a part of that."
Expand a bit on your conversation with coach Dzikic.
"Professionally he believes in a lot of movement without the ball, he plans to bring good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energy in defense and attack and with the Arena crowd it can be successful."
I looked at your career and saw that every team stayed at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel that you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years as well?
"Everywhere I go I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone kept ringing and beeping.
I've received a lot of messages that are already waiting for me.
So I believe we have a good time ahead."
Do you think Jerusalem could be a more significant player than Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you summarize your two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv?
"Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional every step of the way, and no matter how much I got, I always gave everything.
I'm proud of the way I've done over the past year, and now everyone is going their own way."
If it were up to you, would you want to stay at Maccabi?
"After the past year, it was clear to both sides that we were going in the direction of separation, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I hurt a bit in minutes and my status dropped, even though in the middle of the year I had a great period, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized that this was less the place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it."
Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the cup semi-finals last season when I shouted to Ami Biton [Maccabi Tel Aviv team manager] 'this is what I'm here for,' so that's why I came to Jerusalem – to take trophies."

All or Nothing: 1:1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but made amends with an equaliser 10 minutes later
Subsequently, the midfielder was sent off in questionable red (74) •
Hadera also remained at 10 players following a red for Ido Levy (87)
The professional staff of Hapoel Jerusalem counted well tonight (Saturday night) the number of foreigners on the pitch at Teddy, much more than once, it should be noted, and at one point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was sent off).
This time, to their delight, everything went well, and the 1:1 they achieved against Hapoel Hadera will not be taken from them by the Association Tribunal.
Before Hadida's red, he managed to score an own goal and equalise to set up a precious point for Ziv Arie.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadida's private show began.
Plekushchenko went wide, and the midfielder rose and rammed back and the ball stopped in his team's net.
1:0 to Hadera who enjoyed an own goal by the midfielder.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida made amends and in a huge way - Levkovic caught air and the midfielder this time rammed into the right exposed net.
1:1 in Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to register a second yellow and red, this time after sliding in Marmentini's direction.
Daniel Bar Nathan decided on a questionable red and sent the midfielder straight into an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Natan sent Ido Levy through red and evened the balance of power on the pitch as well.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon
60:85
Ariel Beit Halahmi's team composed a third consecutive victory, this time particularly impressive •
Huber and Schuchman (15 each) excelled
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey continued tonight (Saturday night) with an impressive 85:60 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a 3-0 season record in the meetings between the two.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel Beit Halahmi's team has won three in a row, and in fact this is a surprise only for those who did not watch the game.
We haven't seen Holon so bad in a long time.
All this before the series opener against Besiktas in the Champions Cup play-in: just 60 points, a first half without a triple and 11 percent on threes in the entire game.
Bottom line, an unimpressive night by all of the team's players (except Murphy Manko, who scored Holon's 3 threes), including the safe Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in good shape thanks to Roy Huber and Joaquin Schuchman (15 points each).
The first one has rebounded in recent times and the second has flourished again and also dazzled with a basket from three-quarters of the court.
Give them a chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv's Israelis saved Spropoulos
After losing the derby and eighth in a row in Europe, a defeat in the Clasico against Jerusalem - would probably have ended the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach •
So who must Yannis send a bouquet of flowers tonight?
To his Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points at the Arena •
Also: Why the Yellow Club needs to change its "Americanization strategy" and take a vivid example from Ariel Beit Halahmi's model in Eilat
It is hard to remain cynical at the sight of the tearful eyes and the warm and strong hugs that Giannis Spropoulos gave his players at the end of tonight's game at the Arena, and especially in the face of the tight grip and secret exchange with John DiBartolomeo, who single-handedly saved the Greek coach's job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after losing at home in the derby and eighth in a row in Europe, losing the Clasico to Jerusalem and moving away from it to three wins in the table?
It would have already ended the Israeli-Greek romance tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also and actually mainly about the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change in attacking habits and moving the ball.
The ball moved with dedication, with a lot of movement and drills, and Scottie Wilbekin, demonstratively, left the task of concentration to Evans, dribbling very little, and mostly passing blocks and going for shots.
Despite shooting very badly (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed defensively, and most of all, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team returned to its old habits, and the attacks went back to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a 2 and 40 second advantage to the end, Scotty dribbled himself into a corner and threw a floater on one leg that almost lost the game.
The trick is to keep playing exercises and passing motions precisely in the clutch moments, and this must enter nature and the group DNA.
The important learning will be done by Yannis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who became water cleaners and towel waving at games in Europe.
Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them more than half of the team's points (42 of 83), and it was they who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of Maccabi's top five scorers were its Israelis.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can help in the Euroleague as well.
In the first half it was mostly Oz Blazer, who the section has been screaming for a month that he must play more.
Scorers, moral, warrior under the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game smarts.
Isn't that enough?
The second half featured Jake Cohen, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and covering for Žežić's injury, and especially John Dee, who at 70:63 changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.
Yanis has a complicated relationship with Yiftach Ziv, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and burdens him too much, to the point of risking loss.
It's happening in the Euroleague as well, and it happened tonight as well.
But the important learning should be on the part of the club, about its Americanization strategy.
Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or maybe rejected by Maccabi.
And this is happening because Maccabi is gradually leaving fewer seats for Israelis, because of the club's informed and rooted choice to be based on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach a watershed where there will be no Israelis wanting to play there, and then it will look for Jewish children to become citizens, and will pressure the administration/union to further increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake on the part of the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it exaggerates with the foreigners, much because of the tax discount.
It certainly won't be argued that Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones.
For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, it was possible to bring in two efficient and stable stars (star point guard and super-forward) next to Scottie and Žižić.
It will be more efficient, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and generates identification.
It's true that there are two busy frameworks and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which purports to represent Israel, and even receive tax relief from the state for its so-called representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association/League Administration can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 in form, maximum three on the pitch at the same time.
For the ongoing failed achievements (for seven years in Europe), just for Maccabi, is the league flooded with foreigners?
And the actors' organization, how about you?
Is that what you sat for?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there is one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargain to get less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in this direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so nicely.
With 3 foreigners, plus 4 Israelis who were only two on the junior teams (Huber, Ben Moshe, Ravina and Shuchman the fighter), it dismantled Holon (second in the table!) for the second time in the last two weeks.
It's a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run even in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot in the days of Sharon Drucker.
Short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is nothing like Ariel Beit Halachmi, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us of what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at the peak of their fitness, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The foreigners only complement.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from knee injuries, it's going to be a tremendous team.
A song I dreamed of Eilat.
And that Maccabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "There was a feeling that the whole world was against us"
The Yellows are happy after 78:83 over Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena: "We are back to playing like Maccabi Tel Aviv should play" •
About Ami Biton's conversation in the dressing room, the optimistic first diagnosis of Žižić's injury and management's approval of the acquisition.
A great sense of relief was recorded this morning (Sunday) among the members of Maccabi Tel Aviv after yesterday's important and prestigious 78:83 at the Arena Al Hapoel Jerusalem.
The team's players and management embraced coach Giannis Spropoulos, who looked very emotional at the end.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer enthusiastically poured water on Derrick Williams, who excelled in the game, and the rest of the club also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the recent losing streak.
They, too, feared defeat against a great rival that would further destabilize the system.
The fans also stayed for long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
"Yannis and I have an amazing connection in the locker room," Oz Blazer said.
"We know the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We've been looking forward to it a lot, even in the way we played.
We returned to play the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with heart and fight, we stand behind it.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us."
Before the game, team manager Ami Biton entered the dressing room and gave emotional speeches to the players.
"His words had a big impact on how we came out and how we played on the court," Maccabi players said.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi are already aiming for the important game against Basconia on Thursday and want to end the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the last few games we were under a lot of pressure, Giannis told us that if we were loose we would win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
A lot of eyes are on us and it was a feeling of the whole world against us, I'm proud to go to this war, we're cutting off everything around us and looking only at ourselves."
Ante Žižić, who injured his right knee during the final quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
Doctors will check how the knee will react today and then find out how many days of rest it will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Basconia.
Apart from the strong backing given by management to Spropoulos and the professional staff, in a meeting on Thursday professional director Nikola Vujcic was given the green light to bring in one or two players to strengthen the team, and the Yellows hope to add quality acquisitions soon.
Anthony Bennett released from Hapoel Jerusalem
The forward selected first in the NBA draft was unable to acclimatize to the team from the capital •
The club said goodbye: "Anthony has entered the hearts of all of us, thank him for his time in Hapoel."
Four months after signing for Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released from the team's squad on Sunday.
The forward (28, 2.03), who was selected first overall in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaged 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five Champions League games, as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight major league games.
"Hapoel Jerusalem and player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision to terminate the player's contract at the club," the club said in a statement, "Anthony entered the hearts of all of us and we would like to thank him for his time at Hapoel.
We wish him nothing but the best and the best of luck."
Study states: Zoom meetings hurt creativity
About 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem – some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings
The result: a virtual meeting hinders creativity and thinking outside the box •
Columbia University Research Leader: "Visual focus on the screen impairs the idea generation process" •
Consolation: There is no harm to labor productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in Nature examined the effect of meetings through video software on participants' creativity, compared to face-to-face meetings.
Unfortunately, creativity has indeed been found to be impaired in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question—led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University—was whether remote computer meetings preserve the creativity of office brainstorming meetings, or whether creativity and free thinking decrease as a result of remoteness.
The study itself began in 2016 but received a big boost during the two COVID-19 years, during which many employees switched to working from home.
"People in a personal meeting move around the room, using objects and using them for creative thinking," Brooks says.
"In a computer meeting, on the other hand, concentrating on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which hinders the broader and expansive idea creation process."
Space is reduced.
To test the results of the experiment and see if they would be repeated, they were tested twice—once at Columbia University and again in real life—on engineers who knew each other from prior acquaintance.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts – in one the subjects were asked to meet personally and develop solutions to the problem, and in the other they were asked to do so through a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to share the same way and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, there was a decline in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually via video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who studies ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people usually look at their surroundings in order to help generate ideas, while in a video session the thinking converges to the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.
"When people are in the same room, they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can evoke new associations in them.
On the other hand, research shows that computer relationships change our attention so that we are more focused on the inside and on the screen, and this reduces innovation and idea generation through looking at the environment and thinking outward."
There is no harm to critical thinking.
However, before managers rush employees back to the office, the researchers note that "working through a computer did not harm productivity itself or people's critical thinking about innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
In other words, the harm is focused solely on creativity and not on other forms of working with a computer."
Professor Alan Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also qualifies the findings.
According to her, "There is a difference between mere creativity, such as new uses and frisbee (one of the research questions; A.G.) and solutions of work.
It's also possible that when employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or when they're working from home, creativity will improve."
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also proposed future research in which such meetings would be interrupted into thinking states and wandering around the room to see how this activity would affect the final result.
Dr. Olson also suggested that as a result of the study, only brainstorming sessions would allow employees to return to work, and generally suggested not to be alarmed by one study, but to conduct another investigation in the field.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forcibly returned and not happy, that's a bigger blow," he says.
Musk waits for Trump's return: 'It wasn't right to block him'
Twitter's new buyer said he would reverse the decision, which led to the former US president's account being blocked •
"I think it was a mistake," he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter in a deal valued at $44 billion, said Tuesday that he intends to bring Trump back to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after rioting by his supporters on Capital Hill after his election loss against Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to arrest Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake," he said.
"If there are erroneous and bad Tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and a suspension — a temporary suspension — is appropriate, but not a permanent ban," Musk said.
By 2050: The world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture
New global research predicts significant decline in next 25 years •
The Solution: Proper Management of Water Reservoirs
A disturbing new study recently published in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050, the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the pace of water consumption and global population growth remain at their current usage trends.
In the study, in which scientists from all the world's scientific agencies participated, the scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The dismal conclusions of the study show that currently, the rate of water consumption has doubled repeatedly over the past 10 years, while at the same time global warming is causing less rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study data, 84% of the world's land designated for agriculture will experience a severe shortage of rainwater.
One of the main conclusions that emerged from the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and seasons, and to switch to growing methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the water evaporation process that will lead to extensive waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater collection technologies to prevent it from flowing into the sea.
Information about many students from Bar Ilan University leaked online
Hackers who attacked Bar-Ilan University's database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the information about the students if they did not receive a monetary ransom •
The threat was realized and the information was published throughout the network.
Students at Bar-Ilan University are under attack by hackers when their personal information is published across the web by a network attacker known as Darkrypt, who a few weeks ago issued a ransom demand from university personnel and threatened that if he was not paid an unclear amount of money, he would publish the information under his control.
Estimates of the amount of money demanded by the attacker are that it began at thousands of dollars, and as the clock ticked, it increased, and before the information was published, it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are full of angry messages and chaos is rife there, with students unable to access their personal information systems and unable to perform routine student assignments.
The university sent an e-mail message announcing the attack on the academic institution and that they were working intensively to minimize the damage, while detailing some of the information that leaked online.
No special instructions were given to those whose information was hacked, and it said that the university had taken a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's servers.
Gospel for 40 communities: The optic fiber reaches Binyamin
The trend of networking in the periphery with high-speed internet continues, and now the optical fiber reaches the Binyamin Council, which includes 40 communities •
The project, in cooperation with the council and communications companies Telran, X-Fiber and Internet Rimon, will be launched immediately after the holidays.
Over the weekend, the Binyamin Council signed a large-scale agreement to lay optical fibers in all of the council's communities.
The agreement with the Net-Fiber project in cooperation with the Internet Rimon, Telaran and X-Fiber was signed after the conclusion of a large tender that the Council has been working on in recent months.
The work will begin after the holidays and residents of the 40 council communities who are interested in connecting to the fiber optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 gigabyte as well as advanced home end equipment that will enable strong WIFI reception, as required during these times.
Participants will be able to choose between high-speed internet over fiber optic or high-speed filtered internet over fiber optics, which will be provided by Rimon.
The Council made sure that the market remained open to competition under any circumstances.
Binyamin Regional Council head Israel Gantz: "This is true Zionism.
This is great news for the residents.
The life experience in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to learn remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in communities that will receive quality internet and without delays.
I would like to wish success to the dear companies in the implementation tasks in the communities.
The residents are waiting for you."
Gantz added: "Soon we will receive proper conditions of the best high-speed internet in Israel.
We worked for many months to provide a basis for installing the fibers and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank Minister of Communications Yoaz Hendel, who started the project with us during his previous term and we are now reaping the fruits of our labor, the staff of the Minister of Communications, the council members who were in charge of the details of the center, and the CEOs of the companies that won the center for the best professional quality in Israel."
Internet Rimon CEO Yariv Pe'er said, "I thank Mayor Israel Gantz and his team for immediately raising the gauntlet in order to bring good news to thousands of council residents who will switch to high-speed internet that will upgrade the quality of life in education, economics and of course leisure."
Shai Aslan, CEO of Telran Communications Group: "We are pleased with the Binyamin Council's decision to connect to high-speed and powerful internet infrastructures and I am confident that thanks to the group's extensive experience, we will be able to provide residents with high-speed internet just like in the center of the country."
X-Fiber CEO, Israel Elitzur: "The establishment of communications infrastructures in Binyamin is the Zionism of 2021, X-Fiber is proud to take part in the establishment of the state-of-the-art infrastructure in the Biblical areas of Binyamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with Judea and Samaria in general and Binyamin in particular, we will meet any engineering challenge in order to bring high-speed internet to every home throughout the Council."
We checked: What do the side effects after the COVID-19 vaccine say?
Many people who are vaccinated feel weak, fever and fatigue after receiving the shot, while others feel nothing •
Could this indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these symptoms, or is it a baseless rumor?
As more and more people get vaccinated, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are untrue.
Is the immune system of those who develop side effects stronger than those whose bodies reacted less severely to the vaccine, which may prove that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body entering the body?
"There are several levels of reactions to the vaccine," says Dr. David Dvir, head of primary care at Meuhedet and a member of the advisory committee for the TSAM (Epidemic Treatment Team), and reassures: "Headaches, fatigue, pain on the spot, these are the immediate responses of the immune system.
This is how the body responds when a foreign body enters the system."
Is there a connection between the levels of antibodies that develop and the side effects?
"There is no correlation between feelings and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 50-60% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
People who developed strong responses were not found to be more protected."
"There is no correlation between immediate response and vaccination level in the medical literature.
In some trials in which people were also given placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It is also a mental component - how the person perceives the vaccine, if he expects there to be side effects.
Many of the phenomena that happen could also happen normally, but since the public has been vaccinated, it attributes the response to the vaccine itself, and this is a bias that you see with vaccines in general – attribution of phenomena that happen close to the vaccine and are attributed to it."
According to Dr. Dvir, the reasons for the commonly reported symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are still unknown.
Regarding myocarditis (myocarditis), opinions are divided.
"There are all kinds of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One theory is that it's a strong immune system response."
Is it even possible to assess the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, it was shown that those who did not sleep or were under higher stress were more vulnerable to infection.
Apart from that, there are laboratory parameters that check the immune system or its components.
When there is a decline in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone walks around with a weak immune system and isn't aware of it.
These are people who come to inquiries because of repeated episodes of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want an immune system that is too strong, because it can cause autoimmune diseases."
MRNA vaccines will soon appear in additional contexts, thanks to the vast knowledge accumulated about them in recent times.
"There is no doubt that there will be an opening for other vaccines of this kind.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines – for treating oncological diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance remains for very little time in the body - enters, does its action, and then decomposes.
This technology is not new, but it has received a serious boost due to the very great need for rapid vaccination.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week interval between doses is too small, and some vaccine experts claim that after the third dose we may not need another vaccine in the near term, so it is not clear whether we are going to be vaccinated every six months or whether the third dose will give a larger margin."
Thousands affected: Serious privacy lapse on Highway 6
Highway 6 customers?
Your private information, including your full name, addresses, payment amounts and full details of your trips, may have been disclosed •
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz violated the Protection of Privacy Law and its regulations.
Following a report by Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6 in Israel, about a security incident that took place at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement process.
As part of the incident, security vulnerabilities were discovered in its payment site, which enabled the exposure of a large amount of information from the invoices of the friend's customers, which were exposed for all to see.
Among other things, customers' payment invoices were exposed over a short period of time, and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates and at what times.
In addition, since Derech Eretz did not document access to its systems as required by law, it is impossible to know precisely for what period of time unauthorized parties could access the company's systems.
In the infringement letter sent by the Privacy Protection Authority to the company, the Privacy Protection Authority emphasized that most large companies and organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that as threats and risks develop, the organization is obligated to carefully examine the risks that are updated and act in accordance with updating the security measures accepted under the circumstances, in accordance with the nature and nature of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations are obligated to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and penetration tests, in order to examine and prepare for the changing risks.
In addition, companies and organizations are obligated to use an automatic documentation mechanism and training should be conducted for employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Protection Regulations (Information Security).
In accordance with the findings of the Banking Supervision Department, the Authority determined that the company violated the provisions of the Protection of Privacy Law and its regulations, and demanded that the company take a number of corrective actions.
Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6, said: "The matter was handled in accordance with the strictest requirements."
Travel Warning to Istanbul: Surprising News for Israelis from Turkish Airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change their destination or flight date
Good news for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: the airlines will allow changing flight dates.
Reminder: Earlier this week, the Counterterrorism Headquarters raised the severity of the travel warning to Istanbul to level four.
This is the highest level and means "high threat level: do not come to this country and in case of stay leave the country as soon as possible."
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus said they would allow Israelis who booked their flights before the travel warning was issued, i.e., before June 13, 2022, to change their destination or flight date.
This is done by contacting the airline.
Tourism Minister Razvozov said: "The citizens of Israel should not pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
I am pleased that large airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request and I hope that other airlines will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey because of the severe travel warning."

Saudi skies are approaching: Israeli companies are preparing to reinforce routes to the east
The emerging conclusion for an expanded flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: the airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe
Israel's largest airline is planning significant changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we reported in Israel Hayom, it is believed that Biden will announce the granting of permission to El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the United Arab Emirates.
The agreement that is being formulated means that El Al will be able to fly shorter routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.
To do so, the airline will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations in order to free up planes for new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations with a substantial Jewish population, but at this stage they are less profitable for the company.
On the other hand, El Al's new destinations are Tokyo, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
Here's how the move will be made: Dreamliners flying to Canada will be released for long-haul flights to the East.
The Boeing 737s flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which EL AL operates flights using Dreamliner aircraft.
So basically the company will be able to release large planes to fly to other destinations in the east.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to resume flying to Turkey, where the airline will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.
Tidying up the mess: How much will you pay for a suitcase on each airline?
Get the step-by-step guide to baggage prices on different airlines •
Who offers 6 euros for an extra 10 kg, and where does the price never include luggage?
Prices have changed, baggage conditions are no longer the same, and many Israelis are surprised when they arrive at the airport and discover that they have to add large sums for luggage they thought was included in the price.
How do you know the airline's baggage conditions?
That's what we're here for.

Exemption from quarantine for vaccinated and recovered from non-red countries, foreign tourists return.
Those arriving in Israel received notices from the Ministry of Health stating that they are exempt from the quarantine requirement upon receiving a negative COVID-19 test result •
Only afterwards did the ministry issue an official announcement stating that only passengers from orange countries were involved, although returnees from red states also reported receiving the notice •
In addition, tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country, and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
At the height of a pandemic - the end of quarantine for those returning from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent notices to those returning to Israel on Monday morning, stating that they are exempt from quarantine upon receiving a negative COVID-19 test they took after landing in Israel.
These are also returnees from red states.
Some of the messages sent informed returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative response or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative response.
Only afterwards did the Ministry of Health issue official announcements stating that as of midnight, January 4, 2022, vaccinated or recovered persons returning from orange countries will take a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and quarantine for 24 hours or until receiving a negative result (whichever comes first).
The decision will be anchored in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be submitted to the Knesset Health Committee for approval.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovered individuals who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they took upon entering Israel will end their isolation tonight at midnight and are not required to take a second test.
However, travelers from red states reported that they too received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and returned from an orange country will enter home quarantine for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening their isolation upon receiving a negative result on a PCR test performed on the 7th day of landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to lift most restrictions on travelers, especially those vaccinated, comes a day before the High Court hearing filed by the Travel Agencies Association, the Open Skies Bureau and the Hotel Association.
At tomorrow's hearing, the petitioners are expected to demand that all other red states be removed from the list, with Prof. Itamar Grotto backing them up in his opinion.
Foreigners will also be able to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transport agreed that as of Sunday, January 9, 2022, vaccinated/recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) from orange countries will be allowed to enter – subject to filling out an online form in advance, taking a PCR or antigen test before boarding, taking a PCR test upon entering Israel followed by quarantine for 24 hours or receiving a negative test result (whichever comes first).
Unvaccinated/non-recovered foreigners (according to the Ministry of Health's definition) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, except for those whose entry has been approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The outline of the groups will not be renewed at this stage.
And what about red states?
The Committee for Classification of Countries in the Ministry of Health recommends that the government be removed from the list of red countries and that the following countries be transferred to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain on the red list at this stage: the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option being considered by the Ministry of Health is to exempt vaccinated people returning from red countries from quarantine.
At the moment, it is unclear whether there is a connection between the messages received this morning by those returning to Israel and the guidelines that may be received by the Ministry of Health on this matter.
The Ministry of Health has not yet received a response.
The skies are beginning to open: the Ministry of Health changes the restrictions on the country's gates
Vaccinated people returning from orange countries will be required to quarantine for 24 hours •
The US, Turkey, UK and UAE countries will be set in red.
After many weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to fly to without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were required to quarantine, alongside the prohibition on tourists entering Israel, yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend canceling the three-day quarantine requirement for Israelis returning from orange countries.
Until now, anyone vaccinated or recovered according to the Ministry of Health's definitions who returned from an orange country was required to quarantine for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Currently, the quarantine that vaccinated and recovered people returning from orange countries will have to enter is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of the COVID-19 tests performed after landing at Ben Gurion Airport (whichever comes first) will have to enter.
Those who are not defined as vaccinated or recovered will still be required to quarantine for seven days subject to two COVID-19 tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if they returned from an orange country or if they returned from a red state.
A vaccinated or recovered person returning from a red state must also fully quarantine.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to be approved by the government, includes the United States, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, with the exception of Turkey, the average number of positive cases entering the country in the past two weeks is more than 5% of all arrivals, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.
The rate of increase among patients from Turkey is rapid, with a positive return rate of just over 4%, so it was decided to put Turkey on the list of red countries as well.
The prominent countries that will be removed from the list of red countries: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, from 9 January, tourists who are vaccinated according to Ministry of Health requirements will be able to enter Israel without the need to quarantine, and similar to the conditions for Israelis returning from an orange country.
In this case, too, the decision is subject to government approval, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
The tourists are against the restrictions.
The Travel Agencies Association, Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotel Association have petitioned the High Court of Justice to lift the restrictions on flying.
The country lifted most restrictions yesterday, but left eight significant states on the red list.
At a hearing to be held this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red states.
The person who will support the petitioners' position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razvozov, who in recent weeks has supported easing restrictions on the entry of foreign tourists into Israel, said yesterday: "The cancellation of quarantine for vaccinated people returning from abroad and the return of tourism for the vaccinated are the right and just thing at this time.
I thank my colleagues in the government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the harm outweighs the benefit.
The vaccine is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to lead an enabling routine alongside the coronavirus."
With an investment of NIS 200 million: the new resort that will open near Arad
The desert is blooming: another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years •
Chef restaurants, private pools and 110 rooms are just a small part of what the hotel will offer •
All details in the article
Fattal's 7MINDS and the White City Buildings real estate company jointly purchased a plot of land covering a 20-dunam plot in the Judean Desert, where they will build a luxurious resort at an investment of NIS 200 million. The hotel will be built on the same land as the Masada Hotel, which was demolished about a year ago.
The resort will open only in about three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three shared pools, a spa, chef restaurants, an entertainment complex, a gym and more.
The person who will be responsible for the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ran Shmueli from Claro Restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one who will build the menu, which is expected to have a unique desert concept for the resort.
Arad Mayor Adv. Nissan Ben Hamo welcomed the project: "The decision to build a new and prestigious hotel near Arad gives the official stamp of approval to the amazing rise Arad has made in the field of tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the choice of the developers and convinced that it will be a joint success since Arad has enormous tourism potential."

Too bad
It was more interesting to hear how many people received allowances at the Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the requested city centers) is worth, and how much the salary of the employees (minimum).
It is forbidden to privatize Israel Post
The question is how many packages arrived and how many were distributed?
Because some of them disappeared
Packages are ordered, and they disappear at the sorting center in Modiin...
There should be a 5 shekel package tax so they won't just order nonsense for a shekel and load up the mail
This is mainly indicative of the cost of living in the country.
Thanks to King Paks for making it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to approach the mail and hope that letters will not come from them, and the hatred of mail has led us to give up anything that belongs to the possibility of mail.
Good week.
Dismiss all postal workers, and start re-establishing the post office - by a private company.
Employers are arrogant and some are racist!
On the phone, they talk differently and when they arrive at the interview, their true face is revealed.
No wonder you can't find workers.
They are looking for slaves.
Slave jobs
Everyone is invited to get to know true Judaism

Much more suitable than Wilbekin for Maccabi being built.
You can see that there are professionals in Maccabi – Blatt and Ketch.
Perhaps Ler's personal abilities are still on par with Scotty, but a team player, and especially game intelligence, are much higher
So sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and Israelis warm the bench
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners, so they won't succeed with all the stars that have been scratched from around the world
Who is it interested in???
If you're already watching a game with 6 American and 3 Israeli players for decoration, it's not better to watch a Golden State game????
Puzzle until it comes together League Finals
Good luck
Good column.
Loved.
As for the Israelis, he's absolutely right!!
And a note about Ziv - we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he can't be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost confidence (which is no wonder after the treatment he received after 2 bad games in the Euroleague, as if foreigners didn't have such games) and his use may also be wrong, and is a result of the fixations and stencils of the coach.
Blazer not scoring with all due respect...
Yiftach Ziv doesn't have to be at Maccabi Tel Aviv, he's destroying it too
Once there is not a good game but Sorkin and Blazer Dudi and Cohen today well done.
Ido Eshed, a bum fan, Holon, who was given 500 shekels, so he writes nonsense.
Not Federman in the picture.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jack Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor, who in Europe play about twenty minutes and can't score a basket, who needs foreigners at the level of nothing and nothing, much better than the Israelis.
It's good to have a good spirit for everyone, coach, players and management in pulling the momentum
It depends on increasing internal fencing...
and disciplinary and required reinforcement of the guard coordinator
And that's the management part.
Wrong.
Unmediated human interaction is important from many aspects.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is also bad from a professional perspective and the truth, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the camera at zoom and the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom and therefore their creativity was not enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years
Someone here missed an important detail
Scientists are not interested in warming or rainwater
They are only interested in the rate of population growth
They are working on more and more vaccines and bastardizing methods to destroy the world's population, so they tell us Foggy stories about warming and other nonsense they invent
There is no problem with desalination of water, in unlimited quantities
They said that 50 years ago.
In the meantime, there are more people.
The solution is to limit births, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the rest of the leftists are anti-states, and in all religions that believe in gods - among the stupid, the ignorant, the foolish, the blind, or in short - the herds
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living organisms (also sesmolans) consume oxygen and emit carbon report.
The solution: Sesmolans, commit suicide!
It's green.
Good for the world.
May it be better for you, and for sure the Earth and for all of us.
Who are the scientists and how they carried out the research
I don't believe every study that talks about climate warming because that doesn't exist
It is tendentious to control us, to rob us of our freedom and freedom.
It's all part of the New World Order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side as they did during the coronavirus.
I have never heard him present facts from both sides, he always brings the side that serves the globalists.
They're bothering us.
Just burning money on academic "engraving" studies.
As usual, another sketch from the land of the psychopathic smuts.
The situation is actually improving. Human knowledge expands and with it new technologies and improvements.
For centuries, the world's population has been growing steadily at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, launched a huge project of war in the Gobi desert, with amazing success.
The Saudis are doing the same and succeeding (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It's actually the stupid "climate crisis" of the Smolans (emissions of carbon dioxide, which is needed for plants) that is causing the Sahara to become greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the Semolan agenda, so you won't read about it in the newspapers...
The leftists don't worry.
In them, the urine goes straight to the head and so they do not dehydrate.
Does proper management of water reservoirs mean cutting at least 70% of the world's population?
It is surprising that COVID comes along and it is surprising that most of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose implications for the range of 5-25 years on the injected are not even known.
Is it also surprising that the 2030 agenda is underway and now this?
Really puzzling the whole story!!
Lol what.
Tales of One Thousand and One Nights, it's all intimidation and of course nonsense of the left that tries to control the world by controlling the media, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years.
They said that it didn't rain anymore in Israel either, and that the drought is constant, and here it rains.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena and Peres did not know that children of Yemenites were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not rob antiquities, and Ezer Weizmann did not deal with his soldiers.
It is clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting nonsense.
They will also take care of reception in the axes, handling power outages and voltage drops, and we are on the wave
"This is true Zionism," just as opening the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
Following Bennett's crook, the rest of the licking politicians will toe the line.
Even if you give me free flights, I don't go near El Al, more accurately "Lock Al"
It was very pleasant, goodbye and goodbye.
You won't see us in dreams either.
One more big shame, we in Israel are held captive by EL AL All direct flights are in its hands Price pigs Better go bankrupt already, it's time for really open skies.4
Some focus on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows EL AL to fly over its territory, it won't add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big Game Changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, acquisition of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE, tourism, and allowing Israeli infrastructure companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
That's much more interesting than 30 planes a week that would save an hour each.
It is more important that they let their air force squadrons deploy in the Persian Gulf in order to strike Iran, and that they organize the Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Morocco to impose non-stop armaments on Iran for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another IAF squadron to position itself in northern Saudi Arabia and strike the Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from the east from a less crowded area.
After we are done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti and the Comoros into a peace treaty with Israel and get a majority of Arab League countries to join the peace.
After regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdogan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia topple the regime in Qatar and finally eliminate the subversion of that country, and its support for other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these common interests are over, it will be possible to talk about a few more EL AL flights, if at all EL AL survives until then.
El Al needs to close.
Tickets are sold for flights that do not take place.
The worst is that there is no way to get a representative
"No customer service."
Anyone who buys a ticket at El Al and wants to change or cancel should forget about it, a sure loss.
You have been warned.
Air Canada is better
In any case, they prefer to fly in foreign countries
Arkka has gone from company to a society hell
El Al also dropped in level.
Best to book a taxi.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you sued on the train to the field
40 euros suitcase in Ryanair much cheaper than Waze.
A backpack weighing 8 kg can be carried on.
Why are you misleading?
Wizz Air on cargo and seating take much more significantly!!
One big quibble
Just for example, I've just come back if I'm going to get hayad
The allowable weight is 30 kg
and 7 kg trolley
And each extra 1 kg 30 dollars
Go update:
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices, but in the end it's a bag the size of a school bag.
Trolley already costs money and suitcase costs very, very expensive.
Luckily, the airlines don't ask us to come to the flight with underwear and a tank top so that there won't be weight on the plane.
At El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% cost when booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, using the successful method.
A land that eats its inhabitants and eats.
To this must be added genetic stinginess.
Shame on our country for letting foreign airlines oppress Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does as he pleases
So what have you learned today that it's not enough to pay for an expensive ticket?
Prepare a surprise for all of us.
You'll pay extras for the plane's wheels, the windows, the luggage that doesn't arrive, the food, the drinks, and they'll probably add to the bathroom
In short, leave at home and prices will go down.
Or big you will go out in ships
A journey will take a few days
Vomit and then you'll probably arrive
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and harm Israel, while still winning the challenge and support of his new fans.
Open now?
This is not by chance.
Precisely when the mess starts there is an exemption, it's just delusional what's happening here...
This is not the height of the pandemic
Simon, not for you
The number of confirmed cases does not mean that the number of patients is rising
Stop getting tested for any nonsense, sit at home if you don't feel well
The story is over
A government of madmen
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
And especially stupidity
and public confusion score 0
Only harm more than traction
I suggest you open a new corner: "The daily and cumulative number of deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The faces and pictures behind the omission."
Your ratings will soar.
You don't understand, Minister of Finance, for not paying compensation to tourism workers;
Bringing more contagion
They don't care about the people
8500 have died so far
Is anyone talking about this?
They bury us, especially the elderly
We have become Russia/North Korea.
If we don't talk about it - it doesn't exist!!
The main thing is for citizens to put money into the state coffers to grow ministers their buttocks!
It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the prime minister!!
Well, the suspension of Omicron was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half a nation, and there is no point in trying to stop Omicron - which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, they are statistically less dangerous than those who are already here.
This is the first time I have seen sensible steps taken by the Israeli government in the fight against the coronavirus.
As if someone really sat down and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi, did what he thought would look better in the newspaper (and failed on all counts).
Dream government at its best:
A finance minister who told tour guides to find a new profession two weeks ago is pushing to open the skies to tourists.
Education Minister Makishsha slams the Prime Minister and Health Minister and sets her own policy, which plunges all schools into complete chaos!
Foreign Minister, a clown who comes sick with Corona to a cabinet meeting.
And the most clownish prime minister we've ever had in the country, doesn't control the situation and loses his temper like the last hooligan.
Simply a government without our leadership, without direction, in which the entire nation of Israel has lost faith
Go home and beautiful one hour earlier!!
My opinion, maybe it comes from a bad place but from a place of loss of control
Now apartment prices there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Well, where are all the forecasters?
They build a bus station and believe it will affect all the houses.
By the way, except for sponsorship fees after.
Let them discover Arad's exorbitant property tax prices The hotel will return to being a white elephant like its predecessor
Looks amazing.
Good luck.
I feel like it.
What about the art of being photographed completely naked?
Give up the garbage
A serious fight for Breer Field
Why don't they give benefits to girls in the Galilee occupied by the Muslim Brotherhood of the Harbant Six?
All of them for calcans
In the current reality, is the south still ours?!
Need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
Surely the Knesset members will be there too!!
What about a folk hotel for a folk person?
Good for investments in the [blooming] south
Arad is developing and prosperous, and well done to the mayor, who since the beginning of his term has had an explosion for the good and glory of the city of Arad
Cultural life, society, education and more on the height
Simply an excellent mayor who improved the city!
congratulations
I wonder how much protection fees the resort owner will pay.
Prepare money for sponsorship fees?
Wow, sounds good
Those who can only afford El Al – a company with service and security, the best in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai does anyone know????
EL AL Tin Company.
Neither sociable nor economic.
In recent weeks, she canceled return flights from abroad, you see, sent messages to Israelis and told them that the flight was canceled, ruined the entire trip on the spot, told passengers to leave a message on W.App or messenger and we will return, return after a day or even three.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, is it better to ground planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to Israel, and prevent economic damage?
Are there any other suckers flying over?
Also for free did not fly with them.
Have they already returned the millions of customers they took prisoner?
EasyJet to Geneva round trip 70 euros.
One way EL AL $560.
From the religious scammer who controls the company together with his son I don't buy even for $10, cheaters non-stop...
Then the airline will cancel flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be plus the price change.
Whoever purchases tickets at ELAL puts his money on the wing of the plane.
Tin Company.
Exercises of a low-cost company.
No luggage, no seat selection, certainly no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all the members of the Go'alizia... Me!
Nature dilutes fools!!
