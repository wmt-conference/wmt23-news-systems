Three Cheetah cubs born in Iran
The world's fastest animal falls victim to cruel hunting, droughts and deadly road accidents across the Islamic Republic •
As a result, their numbers have plummeted to fewer than 20 cheetahs.
Three Asian cheetah cubs have recently surfaced in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
It is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic condition of the endangered animal in the country following droughts, poachers and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of a cheetah in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
Iran's state news agency Irna reported that the veterinary team, based at Turan National Park in northern Semnan Province, had decided on a caesarean birth in captivity.
Less than 20 cheetahs have been recorded in seven different districts of the country in recent years.
Faced with the threat of extinction, the United Nations implemented a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now it is hoped the new cubs could lead to an increase in the cheetah population in the future.
Last January, Iran's deputy environment Minister, Hassan Akbari, said that the country's cheetah population had declined dramatically from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to just 12 cheetahs.
"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their habitats, hunting and even road accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching speeds of 100 mph.
Cheetahs can be found in various places across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to Upgrade your car: We tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify has begun to try its luck in the hardware world, too. •
After years of development, Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the US •
We got our hands on the first device in Israel. •
Make your old cars smart
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with older vehicles.
A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to individual experimenters in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was extraordinary, as our home car broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.
After two weeks of toying, I realized how the car thing could easily become an integral part of many people's system.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty about a global launch, I believe many would already prefer to use other solutions.
From Idea to Reality
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users started to get an interesting offer in their email box - the option to purchase a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which would turn any old system into a smart car.
The rumours slowly fizzled out until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company was soon planning to introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, those rumors made headlines again after the music service was updated with the car mode - the same one we now know from the app - activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify last April unveiled "Car Thing," its smart vehicle system.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipments.
So of course, right after the press conference that was held, I went to the website and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.
Reconnecting to the site will give me the opportunity to purchase the device with a little surprise - it will cost me nothing.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me greatly with the quality of its construction.
And it's slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a larger, brighter and sharper touchscreen than I expected.
You'll also find a round button and dial next to the screen that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the photos, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively slim profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer that the company allow me to change the dial activity so that I can control the volume of the smartphone, as I can also navigate using the touch screen.
It might be possible in a future version update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type-C cable and various adapters to install.
Many of you may remember how in the past we used to unplug radios and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.
The Car Thing certainly brings back that feeling with its construction form.
The adapters were attached to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, preventing it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
In addition, along the entire top you can find small buttons, which can be easily configured to run different playlists or podcasts.
By long pressing one of the buttons while listening, or by asking the voice assistant, I defined how many playlists I hear frequently and the radio show I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing was more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From Old car to smart car
After a fairly simple physical installation, I plugged the Car Thing into electricity.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setting process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote, so can copy all our account information from it.
This means you'll still have to connect your smartphone to the car, either via Bluetooth or via an AUX cable in order to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all app users, since like the app on a smartphone, it places an emphasis on album photos and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations based on your tastes, your search screen and your personal library.
As mentioned above, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or the manual dial.
Better yet, you can at any given moment call the device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify."
Through it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
From my experience she quite easily recognized my voice even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly onto the device.
This is probably due to the four microphones installed at the top.
It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
Is it worth waiting for?
My experience of using the device has been great, which is a positive surprise to me considering it is still in an initial release phase.
Even when used intensively on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, occasionally a little stutter is recorded in the interface, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.
It's evident that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and of the various versions that have leaked online in this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to designate it for.
After all, it comes down to controlling the app on a smartphone, and not much else.
What's different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and plugging it in so the smartphone is closer to us while driving?
That question is reinforced when you consider that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and most of the time will buy the user a lot more functionality.
Even so, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
Being able to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I've learned to appreciate over the past two weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company is not saying much at the moment.
It hasn't even shared how many testers for the device it currently operates around the world, and how many it plans to add at its upcoming launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is that the price is expected to be 79 dollars (about 255 shekels).
In the meantime, Car Thing provides an initial glimpse into a concept Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel says it has no information at this time about a plan to launch the device in Israel

Did you recruit talent for the company?
That way, you can make sure your competitors don't" steal " you.
The economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is often true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talent •
Here are some tips to help you keep it in the workplace
.
Despite the increase recorded in the past month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be among the lowest in the world, and in the top 10 of the OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the CBS).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is often true when it comes to the most desirable workers-the talent.
When it comes to those professionals and managers who are centers of proven knowledge, experience and ability – the trends in the labor market show that competition for them, the talent as they are called by employers, is still in full force.
What this means for employers is that in the current labor market situation they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after recruiting a coveted talent, for as soon as he enters the company gates, another company will try to snatch him up.
In other words, the competition for talent is so intense that even after they are recruited, they will continue to receive a variety of tempting job offers, with 30% of workers leaving within a month of starting a job.
That is why intelligent employers will immediately move from the recruitment phase of talent to the retention phase, where the path begins first and foremost by preparing in advance and taking creativity in its absorption process.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful absorption process will make talent excited about their new workplace from day one and even look forward to the future.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper absorption process that will help preserve the new talent:
It's no secret - sharing and organization readiness |
Share the factors that will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is vital and important to society and the role, and how you view his contribution.
A new employee who comes to a place where he is expected and understands his value will feel welcome and strive to prove the expectations that a son has.
Knowledge is power-Coordinating expectations |
On the first day, they had a meeting with the talent to coordinate expectations.
Know his professional background and see where he sees himself in the future, so you can present him with the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him to get there.
We are all people-we know each other personally |
During the absorption days, try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and take an interest in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who takes an interest in him and allows him to exercise and express himself beyond the limits of his role will appreciate this and want to maintain it.
Curiosity advances |
Already at the absorption stage you can create attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not necessarily by discussing bonuses and benefits, but by exposing it to an exciting field or interesting technology, since such stimuli for creativity lead to increased curiosity and interest in the workplace.
They also encouraged the talent to voice their thoughts and opinions to the various projects within the company and made it clear to them that they were important to the organization.

Electrification in your Pocket: The cost of not closing the coal plants in June-NIS billion
Report by the Knesset Research and Information Center: Failure to close the Coal Plants on a date set in June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion
IEC: "The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"
.
The economic cost of not closing the coal plants by the June 2022 deadline is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is embodied in the consumer electricity tariff, which is expected to rise in the coming months because of the dearth of coal.
In addition, in 2023, an additional surplus of coal use of approximately 900,000 tons is expected, so this will result in an additional cost to the electricity sector for not closing the coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas will remain significantly lower relative to the price of coal.
The report said that the reduction of about one billion shekels in the electricity tariff in 2022 meant a reduction of about 4% in the electricity consumption rate for the household consumer.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about NIS 1 billion, and the total discount that could have been for the home consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the reform of the electricity sector, it was decided, inter alia, to establish a subsidiary of the IEC, which will establish units powered by natural gas, designed to replace the 4-1 coal units at the Orot Rabin site.
Following this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, stating that the 4-1 coal production units at the Orot Rabin power plant should be discontinued.
The decision set timetables, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly the coal production units 4-1 will cease operating at that time.
The IEC said in response: "The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
According to the ministry's decisions, for several years a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas."
Paying the Price: Everything you need to know about Rising Interest Rates
Next week, the interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percentage point.  •
How much will the mortgage payment cost?
And what is best to do? •
All the answers
The worsening inflation rate in Israel, which has already reached more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise interest rates on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts ' estimates range from 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent.
If interest rates did rise by half a percentage point, it would already stand at 1.25 per cent, the highest level in nine years.
For years, interest rates in the economy have been close to zero.
The sharp rise in interest rates is making mortgage repayments more expensive and putting a drastic strain on households.
With the help of Shai Tzaruz, a mortgage expert, we looked at how much we would pay more and what we should do now.
If the interest rate increases by half a percentage point , how much will the monthly payment on the mortgage cost?
On a mortgage in the amount of NIS 1.2 million, which consists of a 40% prime interest rate track, the monthly repayment will increase by NIS 125.
How much has the average mortgage increased since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, this has been a significantly sharper increase.
This is because interest rates in the other tracks that make up a mortgage (and not just in the prime track) have also risen - in the index-linked track and in the fixed-rate track.
If the interest rate does increase by half a percentage point, the cost will amount, according to Tzaruz's estimate, to NIS 620 on a mortgage of NIS 1.2 million.
The prime track (40% in this track) will complete a cost of about NIS 280, assuming there will be an increase of another 0.5% next month.
The variable interest rate track (26.7% in this track) will complete a consideration of approximately NIS 120.
The course of fixed interest - not index-linked (33.3% in this track) will be priced at NIS 220.
So what is best to do today?
For those with a mortgage that is mostly index-linked, Bundle recommends considering recycling into non-index-linked tracks.
For mortgage-takers whose monthly repayments have increased significantly and it is difficult for them to meet the repayments, he recommends looking at refinancing a mortgage and redeploying it for a longer period.
This is to reduce payments despite the rise in interest rates, as it is always better to meet repayments rather than be insolvent.
Regarding new mortgage takers - he strongly recommends getting to know the different routes and adapting the mortgage to their financial abilities.
In the future, when interest rates fall, they will be able to refinance a mortgage with minimum early repayment fees.
With regard to apartment buyers from a contractor - a bundle recommends that you advance payments to the contractor and take out a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the" Building inputs index " increases the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract is signed.
The Residential Construction Inputs Price Index has risen 6.6 per cent in the past year.
Against the background of the increase in this measure, the Banking Supervision Department announced yesterday that it was considering requiring the creation of a mechanism that would allow the clustering to be included in the mortgages, but the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of fuel is rising - and Israelis will have to pay more than NIS 8 per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price for a liter of gasoline, 95 octane, will be 8.08 NIS •
At the same time, by the end of 2022, the reduction of half NIS per liter in the tax on diesel will be extended
A decade high: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 cents per liter-and will stand at more than 8 shekels per liter from July 1.
The new price for a 95-octane liter of gasoline will be 8.08 and those who wish to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 cents per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half shekel per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022, according to the Tax Authority.
As mentioned above, the price increase is due to the continued rise in oil prices, against the backdrop of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of the dollar.
Were it not for the half - shekel discount subsidized by the government since April, the price of gasoline would have passed the all-time high-NIS 8.25 per liter.
The discount expires at the end of July, and the Tax Authority and the Treasury are currently promoting publication for public comments of an order extending the reduction in the tax on gasoline, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
In addition, from August 10, an additional reduction of another half shekel will be determined, so that only from this date will the price of a liter of gasoline be reduced by one shekel until November 15, 2022.
This is reported by the Tax Authority.
"We have reached a point where I can't remember five months in a row of excess state revenues.
We started a few months ago with the issue of reducing the tax on diesel.
We've been working for a week on a four - month extension of the excise, petrol and diesel tax-instead of half a shekel.
It's good for the industry and the citizen.
If we cut it, it would affect inflation, reduce production and ease the cost of living.
As finance minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus first of all on this," Lieberman told the Israel Democracy Institute's Horowitz Conference on Economics and Society.
At present, more than half of the price of fuel is the taxes collected by the government (excise tax and VAT) - and this is a high tax rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic effect on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business expenses, public transport and air travel prices, transportation costs and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the friendliest city for business
Petah Tikva came in second place in the Economy Ministry's ranking of doing business •
Next: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon Lezion •
Minister Barbie: "The Corona has stressed the importance of local government in business development"
.
Ashdod is the most friendly city for small and medium-sized businesses.
This is the third year in a row, according to the Small and Medium - Sized Business Index of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranked local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place Rehovot.
They are followed in order: Ashkelon, Rishon Lezion, Tel Aviv־Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Be'er Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the Local Authority index.
This is the fifth time and aims to serve as a tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on several parameters examined by each authority, which examine the level of"friendliness" of the authority to businesses in its field.
The measure divides the authorities into three groups of size according to the number of residents, since a local authority of up to 50,000 residents is not comparable to a local authority of more than 150,000 residents.
Tel Aviv surged this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings for each local authority: satisfaction of businesses, accessibility to tenders, accessibility of information and Arnona.
The ranking shows that Ramat Gan dropped from second place to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth place to 12th place and Netanya dropped from fifth place to 13th place.
A decline in the ranking does not mean that the authority's business service has deteriorated, and in many cases it is due to the fact that other authorities ' service to businesses has improved more and they have risen in the rankings, while the authority that declined in the ranking has improved its services to businesses less.
Among the finalists in the rankings are Petah Tikva, which rose from sixth to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
"Business-A Growth Engine"
The ranking indicates that Nof Hagalil leads in local authorities with between 50 and 150 thousand residents.
It is followed by Kiryat Motzkin, Metta Binyamin, Modiin־Maccabim־Reut, Kfar Saba, Raanana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
In the 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The measure is designed to encourage local authorities to make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the time the business opens and throughout its activity with the authorities," said Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Barbayai.
"Businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and are responsible for about 50% of business output and about 60% of employees in the economy.
The development of small businesses is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses that are in it.
The Corona emphasized the importance of local government, and we saw that authorities who acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, became the first governmental interface for them."
Ran Kuiti, Director of the Agency for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities have a central and essential part in the ability of businesses in their fields to thrive and flourish.
In the last two years, as we deal with the coronavirus crisis, the authorities have had a greater role in helping businesses survive in their fields and survive in general."
2021 by mail: 20 parcels per household - and a jump in their weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020 •
The average weight per pack is 435 grams - a 36% jump compared to 2020 •
Busiest month: December, when the average package weight stood at 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail packages arrived in Israel, nearly 20 packages on average per household, according to Israel Postal data obtained by Israel Hayom.
The number of packages arriving in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019, when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there has been a more than 36 per cent year־on-year jump in the weight of packages coming from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products came to Israel from abroad, a 36% jump from 14,860 tons in 2020 and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per pack jumped by 60% in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The increase in the weight of packages is mainly influenced by two major trends, both on the seller's and the buyer's side: the largest overseas shopping sites are uniting items into one shipment and no longer shipping any product from the"shopping basket"in separate packaging.
On the part of the Israeli consumer, the rapid delivery of the shipments, within a few days of the order, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which the purchasers wish to receive near the execution of the purchase.
Also in 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month with the highest number of packages arriving from abroad and the highest number of items was December, with 4.2 million packages weighing a total of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per pack stood at 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
The Black Friday Effect
More packages arrived in December than in any other month, likely due to November's shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The large orders start arriving in Israel between a week and two weeks after purchase.
Study: Most employers don't know they can get tax returns
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels •
Have you changed jobs?
Did you go to the N. F. L.?
Have you moved from town to town?
You may be entitled to a substantial amount in a simple procedure •
All details-inside
Most renters are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to large sums.
The State Comptroller noted in a report two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax returns totaling NIS 3.6 billion, which means you should also check whether you are eligible to receive tax returns.
Many hires can receive a high amount, as four out of five hires are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, however, they serve several tens of thousands of employees a year.
If you think that these funds have gone down the drain anyway, think again: Employees can apply to the IRS for refunds going back six years.
Tax: On conducted in-depth research among 4,000 of its customers regarding tax returns during the year 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their distribution in terms of population groups and in terms of gender, ages and geography.
The data shows that during the year 2020, due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus crisis and the expense of hundreds of thousands of workers to the I. R. A., there have been a number of significant changes, including a 15% increase in the average return to a household that was NIS 4,300 per year.
The reason is that the I. R. S. fees are lower than salaries and therefore create a gap between what the employee paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received in 2020 was NIS 121,054 for refunds over the past 6 years.
What can I get a tax return for?
One of the reasons for getting tax returns is a change in the workplace.
81% of people who changed jobs during the year received an average tax refund of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of women who gave birth and spent more than 16 weeks on maternity leave were eligible for a refund of an average of NIS 3,538 for that year
Another reason for reimbursement is donations.
100% of people who donate and pay taxes have been reimbursed.
Another reason for the refund is failure to register child support credits. 63%
The divorce did not update a credit point for alimony, and therefore the tax refund for every year that such a credit point was not updated is NIS 2,616.
Due to unemployment - Expenditure per Challah: 93% of those who leave for Challah or unemployment and who earn over NIS 12,000 received a tax refund of NIS 4021 for that year.
Other reasons for tax returns include: reimbursement for life insurance payments ,life insurance for a mortgage, reimbursement of a settlement from a credit ,reimbursement for losses on securities, failure to register credit points for a man for birth, and distribution of tax returns by geographic location.
- 94% of people who deposited into personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In an examination conducted on each NIS million mortgage for 25 years, the cumulative tax refund for the period is in excess of NIS 20,000 for the entire period of the mortgage
100% of those moving to the Mezkah settlement received a tax refund for the year of the transition, since a permit for residency in the Mezkah settlement is granted only after 12 months from the date of becoming a Mezkah resident and thus in effect the first year is paid full tax.
79% of customers holding securities were eligible for the tax refund of said years.
However, it is important for anyone who holds securities to check every year since losses are not rolled out from year to year but only through filing a report.
56% of men who have a child do not register credits in the year of birth on their pay slip.
The rate of return can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tax:on CEO, Tal Carmon: "The Corona crisis has caused the Israeli public to become much more active.
He is interested, checking and demanding what he deserves on his income tax returns.
It turns out that sitting at home, either in the IDF or after the dismissal of hundreds of thousands of Israelis for months on end, has caused many employees to look deeply into what they deserve from the state.
It is important to know that today it is possible to perform all the procedures for obtaining tax returns digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past."
Job Market: Fewer Job applicants, more wages
2021 Jobs Report: Top of the Demand - Jobs without Experience •
The number of jobs offered increased by 50% •
Looking for a job, but not hitting the market
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decrease in the number of résumés sent, and for each job, an average of 23 candidates were nominated, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year - according to a report by the Oljobs website for the conclusion of 2021, on the Coronavirus crisis and its effects on the labor market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were most interested in job-saturated areas such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, the inexperienced jobs led the demand with more than 38,000 searches - probably due to the return of young people without professional experience to search for immediate work at the end of their starting salaries.
The number of sales and administration searches was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and guards had just under 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the Corona crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average salary in Israel was NIS 11,675 gross.
The monthly salary in software was NIS 17,915 on average, and in information systems analysis it was NIS 17,140.
However, between the center and the periphery, there was a wage gap of more than NIS 2,000: in the center of the country, it was NIS 12,500 on average, compared with NIS 10,795 in the north and NIS 10,135 in the south.
In terms of gender, the average pay gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the volume of hours, was maintained at 36%.
Men earned NIS 13,295, compared to women's NIS 9,740.
Trying to get back on track
On the business side, lateral growth was recorded in almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses craved working hands.
Thus, the supply of jobs increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40,000 job openings.
A survey of employers by the website found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% indicated their intention to increase hiring, but 72% said they would struggle this year.
The largest supply was for inexperienced jobs-more than 58,000 on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration positions with 44,000 positions in each field, sales and software with 41,000 positions each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and warehouses still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Boimfeld, Director of Research and Content at All Jobs: "Job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive jobs in their eyes.
Also, the prolonged disconnect from the work cycle makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living."
Israel's unemployment rate rises to 6.3%
The Bureau's survey data shows that about 270,000 Israelis remained unemployed in December 2021 •
There were 262,000 unemployed people in November.
The unemployment rate in the first half of December 2021 was 6.3%, about 270,000 Israelis, compared to 6.1% in the second half of November 2021 (about 262,000).
This is according to the data of the Labor Force Survey for the first half of December 2021 of the Central Bureau of Statistics.
The jobless rate was 4.5% in the first half of December 2021, compared with 4.3% in the second half of November 2021.
In other words, that's 193,000 unemployed versus 180.3 thousand.
According to the characteristics of the labor force in the first half of December 2021 among those aged 15 and over, this population consisted of 6,607,500 residents in Israel, not including institutions and those living outside the localities.
Of these, 64.4 per cent, meaning 4,252,700 are in the workforce and the remainder of 2,354,800 are not in the workforce.
Of those in the labor force, 95.5 percent, who make up 4,059,700, are employed and the rest are underemployed.
Of those not in the workforce, 2.3% stopped working because of layoffs or job closings from March 2020.
The Manpower Survey provides information about the labor force in Israel and is regularly conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
In the first half of December 2021, 8,700 people aged 15 and over were interviewed regularly.
In the second half of November 2021, 8,900 people aged 15 and over were interviewed regularly.
The survey population includes permanent residents of the State of Israel, tourists and temporary residents who have been in Israel for more than a year in a row.
The survey allows tracking of the development of the labor force, its size and characteristics, the extent of unemployment, and more.
"Not obvious": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrating the fact that "we can live the way we want," excited for meeting the audience and making sure to spend time with the children •
Kobi Shimoni's Independence Day Weekend, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
"Weekends are the most important moments in my life.
Sanctification and tradition are a very deep root in my soul.
Fridays are devoted to children, Or (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and kiddush supplies, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play cars on a sign.
Sometimes we go to the beach, or even just wash the car, but always stop on the way to buy a gift at the toy store in the neighborhood - and there's always another excuse.
When we come home with our gifts, the smells of cooking greet us."
What does your Friday dinner look like?
"I was blessed with the cooking around me.
From my side is Persian־Tunisian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, singing and joy.
From the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with lots of meat.
When we reach my mother-in-law, the building's lobby already smells amazing from her apartment.
I usually do the kiddush, along with the children, who know it by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of inflatable."
Do you have a special childhood memory of the weekends?
"As a child, I would wake up on Shabbat to the sound of Israeli music on the web and the pale Tracker skits, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every corner of the country made him proud.
He died three months ago of a serious illness, and for him Kiddush and Shabbat were the Holy of holies, mainly from the point of view that the whole family should be together.
I recently released a song in his memory called 'Watching Over You', which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe he would have been proud of this piece, which justifies the bond between father and son."
We will soon mark the 74th Independence Day. As an avid zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a sacred day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia my parents were forced to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who gets to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I would climb trees and tie wires to the house with Israeli flags.
Today my Fourth of July days are filled with performances, and always meet a wildly happy audience, who celebrate that we can live the way we want to.
We need to keep our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren in mind that nothing is taken for granted."
Her Friday: Estee Zakheim welcomes the Sabbath
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": A Friday meal that Esti Zakheim dreams of, and how does she cope with the fact that her husband keeps Shabbat?
Tell us about your preparations for Saturday.
.
"Preparations begin as early as Thursday night, when I return from a show or workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking like goulash, roasts and sauces.
On Friday, for the first part of the day, I take the time to myself, to meet up with friends and friends for coffee, to a play or a movie, or to attend rehearsals.
In the summer the saturdays come late, and I have a lot of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just have a good show.
At Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Varda, who turned 89, and also friends."
Can you share more cooking?
"I like shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting and weeping, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry it.
On my Saturday table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
I do most of the cooking, and of course they heat up on the plate on Saturday.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and in winter - the cholent."
Your husband is a religious man and you are from a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with a Sabbath keeper is an endless compromise.
"Love your neighbor as yourself," in fact.
For family trips he couldn't go out, so I often found myself packing up the kids and joining friends ' family trips.
Plus, I'm also the on-call driver for the kids, the one who brings them back on Friday nights from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of Shabbat, because I don't usually show up on Shabbat and get a kind of 'forced vacation' - and that's good."
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
"I would open a big table and invite 'my dead'.
Sometimes I imagine what would have happened if my brother Daniel had lived, or if my father, Shneur Z"l, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
We must have been fighting about football and politics and getting away from each other."
Do you have a special childhood memory of the weekends?
"We were a warm, united family.
On Friday afternoon, Mom would make a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pita beans from the market and burn aubergines for a tahini salad.
Then we would go to Aunt Hannah in Yad Eliyahu, or as she would say, 'Yad Eliyaquah,'and she would make blintzes.
Since only I didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the brothers, and cared for me.
On Saturdays we would take a tour with my father in the Jaffa port, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing."

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck get Engaged
Nearly two decades after their love story ended in breakup, Lopez and Affleck are back in each other's arms •
Lopez split from baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
.
His one: Nearly two decades after their first love story ended in a breakup and a year after a high-profile comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are coming full circle romantically and engaged.
The happy news was shared last night (Friday) by Lopez with her fans on her official website onthejlo.com
.
The news of the engagement comes after this week Lopez was pictured walking around with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A rep confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
Remember, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and asked Lopez (52) to be his forever was in 2002, when it was an eye-popping ring with a huge six-carat pink diamond, worth an estimated.2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the pair split in 2004, accusing the media of over-obsessing and constantly probing their lives.
Affleck has since married actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as he is known, has been married three times before, including to singer Marc Anthony, who together became parents to twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she split in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
Keeping Up with the Kardashians: 'We can't make up what happens to us'
"The chaos is never-ending," Mom Kris Jenner insists on new series starring reality TV's first family, and gets backing from her daughters and new producer •
In an article to be published in Sat magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR grinder, the brand factory and the change Kim wants to make in the world:"I'm no longer the one who thinks for hours about what bikini selfies should be uploaded."
That may surprise many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 of the Disney content empire, which also includes the Marvel and Star Wars films, is the Kardashians.
Details of the reality TV and social media first Family's contract with Disney were not disclosed, but estimates suggest a minimum amount of מאה 100 million was given to the family's daughters, who now also act as producers.
At a press conference with the stars, each accompanied by an entire beauty team that takes care of makeup, hair and wrinkles in clothes non-stop, the family members, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it was not reality, this time what was being received on screen was completely authentic.
"We can't make up what happens to us, "says family mom Kris Jenner,"The chaos is never-ending."
"We're showing how much we've grown since that series came out in 2007," Khloe Kardashian said.
"When we started we were terrified, a lot happens to us in life and it is impossible to simply frame everything into a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
Many storylines have been edited out, wrapped in a sugary coloured ribbon and forgotten on the side.
This is not what life looks like in real life.
Now we're more exposed, facing directly to the camera naturally, not just a reality show but an authentic documentary series."
When confronted with their new involvement in the production of the series, which effectively gives them complete control over the content they receive on screen, Chloe says: "We are involved behind the scenes, seeing edited footage and giving comments, but not from a defensive place but simply giving our opinion on what will make the show better.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel like I've gone through emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they're more of a pushover."
'I've grown Up'
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues with all her might to change her image, from a cheap reality TV thrash to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I've grown up, "she says," raising four black children, that is, from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality so that my children and the children of all my friends have a different future, hopefully we can heal the broken system.
That's my motivation."
"I'm no longer the same Kim who thinks for hours about what bikini selfies should be uploaded," she insists, "but it hasn't completely disappeared from my life either.
A person must be true to who he really is and take everything in fun."
About the reasons for firing the producer who discovered them, Ryan Seacrest, and their new and very profitable path in the industry, the significance of the move to Disney, the family's oiled PR machine and its impact on the profitability of the brand, and more, in the full article that will be published in Shabbat magazine.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The "Next Star" winner finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and his father's significant presence in his life •
"The song is about how to keep in touch from afar," he says.
Tamir Greenberg on his second single Into the Night after captivating the crowd with his first single and his participation in"The Next Star."
In recent months, Greenberg has continued with many performances: the Tel Aviv Cultural Hall, the Tel Aviv Opera House, Amphi Shoni, Amphi Gani Yehoshua, Hangar 11 and dozens of other performances.
"Into the Night" was produced and adapted by Greenberg with producer Stav Bagger.
The video, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to memories of his childhood and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song is about the relationship between my father and me.
About the time I left the country for the U.S. and the way to keep in touch from afar,"Greenberg says.
In the coming month, Greenberg will perform at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and ahead of the new season of "The Next Star", the song with which he won the show, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Blue and White: Yuval Shmalah is the season's big winner and the 16th ninja in the world
The phenom climbed Mount Maduriyama in 26 seconds and captured the title of "The first Israeli Ninja" •
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of ninja.
the U S
There is a winner: Yuval Shmala conquered the Midoriyama, and he is the winner of the fourth season of "Israel Ninja" and now holds the title of the first and 16th Israeli ninja in the world.
Schmeichel has been on the show since its first season, when he finished first, and in the second season he lost to Gil Marantz.
He won again in season three and recently returned for season four, and during filming he declared it would be the last season.
This evening he climbed Mount Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, beating competitors Yogev Malka and Yishai Chalfon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain by 29 seconds and finished second.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season only one ninja can be crowned who managed to climb the Midoriyama in time.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, since Yuval Shmalai this season climbed the Midoriyama by 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the Ninja World title.
He will be able to compete for it again next season.
"Ninja Israel" is the most important sporting event in the world.
.
Two Olympic medallists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat through the final of a reality show and acted like it was the most significant sporting achievement on the planet
.
Rotem Sela represents for us a feminine ideal so perfect that it is perverse to present it this way on television.
She makes more money on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in place, and - when necessary-to advocate for her business partner.
She is a mother and also a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads series and reality shows, and serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Sela is going through too perfect a screen, because the show she hosts must be perfect, and there is no need to apologize for it.
In Ninja's world everyone is larger than life, and the guides first.
Assi Azar was caught up in an affair that was supposed to erase him from the screen for a while, but because he is not an ordinary human being, he escaped from it even before the first batch of commercials.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Niv Raskin, who has won European cups and world records in his life, but is excited by the mega־wall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
At the final, two Olympic gold medalists (Jordan Jarbi and Linoy Ashram) sat beside him, as if to underscore how rare and high־quality the conditions of entry into the superhuman world this reality show has presented for four seasons.
"Ninja Israel" was blown out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Mount Midoriyama and Yuval Shamal who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned Ninja.
There he led an almost insurmountable trajectory, one by one bringing down all the superhuman characters the show had to inflate their egos throughout the year.
Want to be a ninja turtle?
Not with us.
This is where superheroes are sought.
The emphasis was on searching for a successor to the left, who is known as" the King of Kings and one of a kind, " and other nicknames meant to clarify how perfect and unique he is.
As a result, the level of difficulty was raised, the girls trying to compete on the season's tracks crashed, and the boys competed among themselves over who had the more belly squares and plywood charisma to step into the shoes of the retiring Schmaltzer.
It will be said that it is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges, but for the vast majority of viewers - mediocre armchair yams like us - "Ninja Israel" fosters for us an unattainable sports־achievement model.
Faster, stronger, taller, more perfect.
As Gil Sassouver moves between punchlines and conversations about sainthood
It's strange to see the comedian, X Comedy Store, host a Saturday night show on Channel 14, where he tastes pots and gives a stage mostly to men.
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question, "What does the concept of" preparing to sit " remind you of?".
Say: Sponges and cleanings, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi Kachon on TV, but the weirdest thing would be if someone suddenly said "Gil Sasover."
Because the age of Sassuber in the middle of the spoonfuls and the cooking is about as out of touch as television can offer.
And indeed, "Getting Shabbat," the new show he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, is spiritually detached from the time it airs.
Across half of it, Sassuber stands.
He speaks quickly, holding a microphone in his hand even as he tastes dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punchlines and conversations about holiness.
In his defense, it will be said that the budget poverty is being felt, which is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was still felt in the premiere program, which aired the day before yesterday from the Benjamin Headquarters, is a clear gender divide.
The men sing, play, dance, talk Torah, market restaurants and factories - while the women made do with a small room, where they excitedly recounted running a sewing shop.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Getting Shabbat with Gil Sesover, now 14
Ruthie Russo: "Saying' It tastes like assisted living 'hurts our work"
Chairwoman Yuli Gat sent a letter voicing the union's complaint against what they said was an insulting remark by the "Next Restaurant" judge in one of the trailers for the show.  •
Ruthie Russo responded: "Glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population."
The Association of Nursing Homes and Protected Housing in Israel against "the next Restaurant": In a letter sent by Chairwoman Yuli Gat to Israel Hayom, it reads: "In the pre-broadcast trailer, which was circulated on all social media and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said 'food tastes like sheltered housing', i.e. food of a closed institution with Low-level food."
"The tone chosen by the judge of the show, Ruthie Russo, to describe her disappointment with the food that the contestant served immediately cancels our long-standing work to fight against the ignorance that exists in the field, because the houses of protected Housing operate restaurants in the various houses for the benefit of the residents with the highest level of chef's dishes."
It added:"Service teams and home managers struggle to maintain the image of protected housing that offers quality housing solutions for the elderly, including alleviating loneliness, abundant leisure activities, a high standard of living and more."
In Israel in recent years, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most serious disease in old age and see community places as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, so we devote resources and effort to serving residents the finest food.
Most sheltered housing houses use professional chefs to build a menu.
We will be happy at any time to invite the team of judges to be impressed with the winning dishes served daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff in the safe houses we will ask for your apologies and clarification.
Come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly."
Ruthie Russo commented: "Glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population, which definitely deserves excellent food in the advanced period of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, chefs and chefs everywhere, even in protected housing."
"Double Standard: In Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't cancel?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer was referring to criticism levelled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards •
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
"
Nick Cave earlier this week cancelled an appearance in Russia because of the war, declaring that he "stands with Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon."
In doing so, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who have also cancelled shows in the invading country.
But in Kiev's case his cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet slammed the singer as a hypocrite, as in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two concerts held in Israel, despite widespread criticism from pro-Palestinian groups.
"At the end of the day, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."
The same Ahmet remembered well Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even posted on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files," a poignant post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying state, and therefore the state of Palestine is the same as that of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your announcement about Ukraine," Ahmet wrote. "It is that you did not support the Palestinians, who are also suffering from a brutal regime.
In fact, you have described Israel as a functioning democracy, but I think Israel is primarily responsible for Palestinian suffering.
It makes me very sad, as you represent a double standard here," the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story did not end there, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he stressed that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbour, in the hope of changing the security order of the whole of Europe.
The second situation is complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel great sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are and who they are."
Cave added that while he doesn't want to elaborate on his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly supports the Palestinians as well, noting that in the past 20 years he has often attended fund-raisers on their behalf.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Ahmet, "the singer clarified," this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently having a catastrophe on their soil.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them, I would."
In light of the decline in morbidity: the Corona project will return to run the Ziv Hospital
Professor Salman Zarqa was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the third wave and Fourth Wave Coronavirus treatment policy •
At the request of Minister of Health Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as a project •
Prof. Zarqa: "I am glad that the Omicron wave continues to wane, and it is still our duty to prepare for another wave"
.
Against the backdrop of the decline in coronavirus morbidity, the coronavirus project, Prof. Salman Zarqa, will return to run Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Minister of Health Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as a project.
"I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to wane and that we have regained our normal way of life, "Professor Zarqa said, adding:"It is still our duty to prepare for another wave of morbidity as a result of the fact that the virus is still here, in Israel and around the world."
Prof. Zarka was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the third wave and fourth wave coronavirus treatment policy.
Since May 1, Israel has returned to an "inter-wave" mode, which includes reducing most of the corona arrays, while maintaining capabilities to conduct sequencing tests and investigations, which will form the basis for action if a new variant is discovered.
Hidden Morbidity
The report by the National Information and Information Center for the Corona Campaign, released this morning, noted that "there has been a decline in the average of new adoptees to below two thousand per day, the weekly average, along with a decrease in the number of hospitalized and those in serious condition."
However, they stressed that " there is a hidden morbidity of significant proportions and in practice the number of people infected is much higher.
Number of institutional tests carried out in the community (without weighting of tests returned from abroad, m.c) - Low, with fewer than 20,000 tests on a weekly average.
The low volume of tests makes it difficult to identify and understand morbidity trends."
State Comptroller's Report: The actual budget for most years of the Pharmaceutical Basket Committee's activity-smaller than the Recommended budget
According to the report by Matanya Engelman – for more than 20 years of Hessel's activity, the Ministry of Health did not supervise the committee's activities •
The report also said that meeting protocols are being published significantly late, if at all •
The comptroller also recommends increasing transparency of the subcommittee's activities – and updating basket work procedures •
Another flaw is that since the committee began its activity, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the scope of the uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket – which would have allowed them to analyze and audit the budget given to them.
The Drug Basket Committee is one of the public committees that most influence our daily lives and health.
Every year, the Committee decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the health funds – but a new report by the State Comptroller published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without having made control reports on its activity and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Board monitoring and examining its activities.
Israel Hayom correspondent Ran Resnick adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted in the wake of the ongoing revelations in Israel Hayom about drug basket failures.
According to the report by Matanya Engelman, he recommends "making corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will result in a higher quality utilization of the basket of health services that the public is entitled to."
Throughout the years of the addition mechanism to the drug basket, in the years 1998-2021, eight billion shekels were added to the state budget – with the addition each year in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new medicines and technologies to the health care basket, at a total annual cost of more than two billion shekels.
In practice, the budget allocated to expanding the basket was less than the scope of the requests.
In most years of the commission's operation (90% of the time), the budget supplement was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.
The auditor notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the height of the annual supplement in order to allow certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that"the model of transparency in basket work is lacking."
Thus, for example, the Basket Committee's working procedure states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 109-160 days, when sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in the publication of the protocols undermines the transparency of the decisions; as a result, the ability of the bidders – patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies – to submit repeated requests as soon as possible and relevant, after drawing lessons from the rejection of their proposals, analyzing the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improving and amending their proposals, and re-evaluating the feasibility of accepting them in the next round," he said. The reviewer in the report.
"The Ministry of Health should publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules set out in the procedure."
Out of thousands of submissions, only one financial comment was submitted
Engelman's other criticism concerns the preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The auditor found that about half (46%) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage, but the Department of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.
Another flaw concerns the activities of the Drug basket subcommittee, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The auditor recommends bringing in a public representative or exploring the possibility of making the discussions public without confidential commercial details.
The procedure used by the Health Services Select Committee states that "an economic assessment should be submitted" for a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions – and the commission makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, the Basket Committee hearings for the years 2019-2021 submitted requests to add to the basket of anti-obesity drugs.
The report found that the requests did not include economic estimates, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved by reducing the damage of obesity-related diseases or the ability to avoid gastric bypass surgery.
Further, the decisions of the Drug Basket Committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparedness to treat an increase in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The auditor also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the HMO are included in the drug basket, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health (the"third Supplement").
That is, when the legal framework for this measure is regulated only retrospectively.
In the past six years, NIS 74 million has been used from the addition to the drug basket for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Department of Health update its basket work procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.
About one-third of new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as"no-cost drugs," whose use does not cost the health funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.
The comptroller proposes to examine the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and abbreviated route, so that the portfolio of drugs can be updated several times a year rather than just once a year.
There is no control over the use of expensive drugs.
The audit also shows that since the Basket Committee began its work 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the HMO to report and has not monitored the scope of the uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the Ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports relating to the years 2006-2009 were published, and these were also published significantly late (the last one was published this year and dealt with the exploitation of the budget in 2007-2009).
"The delay in conducting tests can lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, to the irrelevance of the conclusions drawn from the examination after such a long period, to the underperformance of the subcommittee and to decisions based on non-final findings," the report said.
The ministry also does not audit and monitor the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not done any research.
These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2016-2021).
The auditor wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use compared to the estimates.
Controls and analysis will enable systemic conclusions to be drawn about the work process of the select committee and the subcommittee, and how the estimates are prepared when pricing drugs and technologies and to improve them."
'Shocking and Incomprehensible': Health Committee debate on Dafne House poisoning
The indicators of the first José who died were normal ten minutes before her death •
Chairman of the committee, MK Silman: "If people there cared that the kitchen would be like home, it wouldn't look like that."
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old José from the "Beit Dafna" daycare center in Holon died of food poisoning, medical measures were taken that were normal, she claimed today (Tuesday) at a hearing of the health committee that runs the daycare.
"We have night therapists who check in during the night and there is a nurse who does the rounds.
There have been a number of reports of diarrhoea and the last time she was taken to hospital was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was followed up like the other dikers with diarrhea.
She is a nursing home patient, we went to get a manoch to assist with her transfer and then the same resident was unresponsive.
We started CPR and called the clinic nurse," the day care manager described what happened last Sunday morning at the day care.
Three residents died, six were hospitalized and a total of about a quarter of the daycare's residents (33 out of 131) suffered diarrhea from eating contaminated raw meat.
The director of the daycare center made the comments against the backdrop of claims that a death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Nos, Head of Epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, said:"We cannot conclusively determine why the three occupants died.
They only took blood tests."
It also emerged that the residents who were admitted to the hospital could no longer receive a stool sample because they did not have diarrhea and therefore it is not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.
An engineer on behalf of the Ministry of Health also noted that "the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary condition in the kitchens in the institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or for a renewal of a license."
The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that it had not yet appointed an investigative committee for this case and for a previous case of hazim abuse that occurred three months ago at the Bnei Zion Institute in Sharon.
The chair of the Health Committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the debate:"If people there cared that the kitchen would be like home, it wouldn't look like that.
Social housing tenants need more.
They are sensitive to health and need extra care and care.
It is shocking and incomprehensible what took place there.
The horrific findings came to light after they knew the Department of Health had come to look into it.
Where is the oversight and accountability of the offices?
How come the ministers and the directors of the ministries are not present in such a discussion to explain what is happening here?"
Yigal Nachomi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, which runs the day care and even managed the day care himself, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire system rise up with only one goal: to do good for people.
The people who died are people I took care of personally.
I put one of the tenants to sleep on my hands.
This is a shocking event for us."
Smadar Ona, a former resident of a residence the same age, lashed out at him and said, "Stop with the lies and the nice words.
I was there."
Gali Barami, representative of parents in Akim Israel: "We have complained before about the food and did not accept the criticism."
Oren Hellman, founder of the Equal Chance for Integration of People with Disabilities, protested that the names of those who died were not released: "They don't even know their names.
Are they worth less?
They are ruining our children's lives."
Suspected failure at Wolfson: The surgeon caused a rupture in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Feras Abu Akar as the director of the hospital's thoracic Surgery Unit •
The chairman of the Doctors ' Committee complained that the director, Dr Engel, had been warned before his appointment •
Hospital: 'He is respected and experienced'
First Publication: An appalling mistake occurred at the Wolfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during surgery the doctor performed a tear in the patient's heart, leading to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83־year-old lung cancer patient took place on April 19.
This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Feras Abu Akar at the hospital, after he was appointed director of the thoracic Surgery Unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, leading to severe bleeding and causing the patient's death.
But the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, raising serious questions about the hospital's management.
The director of the Oncology Institute and the chairman of the Doctors ' Committee, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation into the affair in a letter he forwarded to the hospital's director, Dr. Anat Engel.
In the letter, he made the most serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.
Huge hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient has been lucid, functioning and cared for by him for the past four years.
He had recently had a spread of the disease, and an abnormal build-up of fluid was discovered inside the pericardium, which houses the heart muscle.
Also, surgeon Dr. Abu Akar, was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred in the surgery, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of the Heart and chest Surgery department at Wolfson, who was in the surgery with a child in the next room at the time,"was rushed to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."
He said the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressure was zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar was not professionally and personally qualified to run a thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and even though he was supposed to be the direct manager of the chest surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without sharing it and accepted Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
He added:" This is an uncomplicated procedure, which lasted a few minutes, "adding:"It is impossible not to consider the inadequate process of accepting Dr. Abu Akar for the position.
The question arises as to whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the surgery and the death of the patient."
Experienced surgeon
Before Israel Hayom, information and allegations were raised by other senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised in the case by Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of A surgery at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint, writing that Dr. Abu Akar is"one of the most experienced surgeons in Israel, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon."
He added that he had been selected in a proper tender and Dr Dekel had not taken part in it, in line with his statements of wanting to"disengage "from the chest unit.
He added: "I wasn't a party to the procedure either, and I might have been.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Feras Abu Akar began work on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace, "All the hospital doctors were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of cases of similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it did in an unfortunate way.
Wolfson Hospital said in a statement: "We offer our condolences to the family.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The chest surgeon mentioned in the article is a highly regarded surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in the tender to manage the thoracic surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, the words quoted are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very difficult situation.
The hospital is investigating the details of the case with transparency, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case."

A model for healing: Three senior doctors tell of their mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, especially in the days of the plague •
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh does not forget, even from the top of his job, the push from the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik. •
And Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev thanks Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld for the lesson in identifying with patients •
Three key people at the hospitals write about those who inspired and encouraged them to be better, both as caregivers and as human beings.
Three senior doctors, three teachers of life and profession: On the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, Israel Hayom invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to recall the characters who accompanied them at the beginning of the journey - and helped them become who they are today.
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba |
the late Prof. Marvin Shapira
The Meeting that Opened my eyes - and Changed my Life
If I hadn't met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained a specialist in internal medicine.
He was the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and inspired me to pursue it.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, then in the 1980s.
For a moment I did not think that I would leave the inner, for I loved the treatment of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also expressed in neurology, in the inner as well, and in virtually every area.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
All along, I've loved his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the bottom of the problem.
Discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor of all intents and purposes, who loved the patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to look into everything.
He was a genuine and honest man, devoid of ego, qualities I loved very much about him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I was going to choose my father, the late Dr. Joseph Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who inspired me to go to medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapiro.
Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors still use to this day - for example, "Tissue is de ischio," meaning that taking a biopsy of tissue from an infected organ allows you to know which drugs you should give; or "won yo hughes it, yo luz it," which is meant to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
The late Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked at Hadassah and the father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven I cried.
He was something - a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to treat epidemics, and he is sorely missed during this period.
Had he been with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the team to tackle epidemics.

the Late Prof. Shaul Sukenik
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
.
I first met the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik when I was a student in the fourth year of my medical studies, and I arrived for a course in internal medicine in Internal Department D, which he managed.
Later, I returned to the department in a sixth-year rotation, and I did the thesis of the medical school under his direction, writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).
Saul influenced every significant juncture of my professional life over the course of 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my image as a doctor; not only professionally, but also - and especially - personally and humanly.
During my internship, I wavered between family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about choosing the internship.
I eventually chose to specialize in internal medicine at his Soroka.
During my internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways - in scientific writing (sorry, Saul, I wasn't diligent enough), in contact with patients, in working in a multi-professional team - a field in which the department excelled - and, in fact, in every aspect of medicine.
To this day, I recognize in me, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from Underworld.
When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go abroad for a training period, Shaul pushed and directed me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.
The training period was a very important time for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and push I'm not sure this would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital board, Saul was again the one who supported and helped.
We later worked together in the Division of Internal Medicine.
Shaul knew how to combine the teacher, the manager, the friend and the team-mate wonderfully, without his various roles interfering with each other.
I want to be as successful as he is in this unique combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns, who are now throughout the medical system in Israel, and in their excellent work commemorates his memory and work.
I am honored to be part of this group.

About Dr. Tommy Schoenfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and mostly listening.
Dr. Tommy Schoenfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care Unit at Schneider Children's, taught me to be an intensive care doctor, but more than that - he taught me to think.
The obvious thing I learned from him is to care for the most complex, sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious one is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined they would be caught up in these complex situations in an intensive care unit with their children.
Sounds strange, but it's the obvious one.
But I learned even more profound and profound things from him.
Looking back, because I am a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, it is clear to me today that the connection between the worlds is clear; the education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.
Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurse practitioners, to the young and old staff, and to listen to the parents.
All this needs to be done not only to communicate more correctly and successfully, but to constantly gather a great deal of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventative processes in pediatric care exist everywhere, and of course in intensive care.
Listening and talking engenders a deeper understanding, both from the care team and from the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true in looking at an entire system.
The more thorough and rigorous understanding that integrates all the caring factors in the discourse, the more accurate the decision - making process will be, adapted to the situation, and especially-early enough to prevent future, immediate or distant damage.
That's why Dr. Tommy Schoenfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He's a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, to listen - and then to apply.

Medical Malpractice in various stages of birth
In order to win damages,the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence
Birth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in a family's life.
However, unfortunately, sometimes births end in severe damage caused to the mother or newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where the birth ended in physical injury, the newborn or the mother has room to examine the events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in the field of medical malpractice will examine whether there were flaws in the conduct of the medical team during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, if he sees fit, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every error in care on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during the birth do not necessarily indicate that her management was negligent.
When, then, is it negligence?
When the doctor's mistake resulted from ineptitude or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the ineptitude and deviation from the acceptable level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.
In this article, we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications can occur at each stage and when they arise to be treated.
Stage of contractions
The labor phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (in order to allow the passage of the fetus during childbirth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most cases of medical malpractice in the contraceptive phase involve failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes even cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy can be caused by a failure to recognize or delay in identifying a grandparent's breast, which is manifested in a failure to supply oxygen to the brain tissue of the fetus.
As a rule, monitoring the condition of the newborn and correctly decoding the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early detection of fetal distress development, allowing the medical team to act quickly and extract the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.
Cases in which the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or that the staff misinterprets the data in front of it, especially the fetal monitor, or responds belatedly to the distress expressed by the monitor may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a prolapse of the umbilical cord as well as a rupture of the uterus that was not detected in a timely manner.
Even in these difficult events it is important to ascertain whether the medical staff acted properly.
For example, Adv. Anna Rafe Liganza, of Sror & Co., a financial firm that specializes in representing victims of medical malpractice, said that her firm handled the case of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the head of the fetus was too high, resulting in a prolapse of the umbilical cord (when the umbilical cord precedes the head of the fetus) and injury In the supply of oxygen to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and being born with a severe neurological injury.
In another case, the lawyer said that her office had filed a claim due to gross medical negligence by the maternity ward staff at a large hospital who, during labor, failed to identify in time clear signs that warranted a real suspicion that the woman was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy.
The fetus, which was ejected through the tear in its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity, suffered from severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during birth, the child had a complex neurological disability.
We will emphasize that in order to win damages, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that resulted in the failure to identify the tinnitus and the damage caused to the newborn, i.e. that the damage was caused due to such negligence and not for any other reason or cause.
The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out by examining medical indicators that according to the medical literature only in the existence of which there is a causal relationship between the tinnitus and the brain injury.
Among other things, measures of the pH level in the foetus's blood, its apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic injury, and more are examined.
Fetal Death
Stage of Active birth
The stage of active delivery begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 cm and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Delay in birth and avoiding C-section
In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., a lack of progress of the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a C-section, in order to prevent various damage that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.
"There are cases where failure to perform a C-section in a timely manner can cause irreparable harm to the fetus," Reif-Liganza explained.
"For example, we handled a medical malpractice claim of a birth death caused by a significant delay in performing a C-section.
Contrary to all recognized medical practice, the medical staff failed to recognize the fetal distress and perform a C-section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the surgery caused systemic damage to the newborn which ultimately led to her death shortly after birth."
Negligence in Vacuum Birth
In situations where the mother or fetus is in significant danger, which requires a particularly rapid termination of the birth, sometimes a vacuum birth is carried out.
In this process, a "dome" vacuum is attached to the head of the fetus and forcibly pulls the fetus out.
Naturally, this action involves dangers and can cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great care, precision and skill.
In these events, medical negligence may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory guidelines and carries out the operation despite the existence of a counter-label, such as when the head of the fetus is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for longer than permitted, or when despite the failure of many attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the action more than the permitted number of attempts.
In these cases, if the negligent action of the vacuum caused damage to the newborn – among other things, it may cause cranial damage and bleeds that may cause brain damage – there is room for a tort claim to be filed.
ERB Paralysis
Erb paralysis is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (a nerve node that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is worth examining whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric staff.
The injury is caused by weakness of the arm muscles and can result in complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a 'shoulder injury' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the foetus's shoulders become trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.
When should you suspect that the paralysis is caused by medical malpractice?
In cases where an assessment of the weight of the fetus indicated that it was a macrosomial fetus, that is, it is expected to be born weighing in excess of 4.5 kg and according to the guidelines it is better to deliver the mother by caesarean section.
When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kg, a C-section should be considered in light of the risk factors including gestational diabetes and the lengthening of the second stage of birth.
In the event that the medical team ignores the assessment of abnormal weight of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with vaginal delivery and the risk of ERB shoulder injury and paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.
Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that"the risk of shoulder stenosis occurring during childbirth can be foreseen with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where it is feared to occur, is to conduct a caesarean section."
Placenta Exit Stage
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the newborn's exit and is accompanied by bleeding.
In most cases, the procedure lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby is born and often occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.
After the placenta is removed, the medical team will check whether it has come out intact or whether parts of the placenta remain in the uterus.
During this stage, complications may occur that may cause severe damage to the mother.
One of the known complications resulting from placenta residue in the uterus is called Ascherman syndrome, scarring of the uterine wall resulting from inflammation caused by placenta residue in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the endometrial in a way that makes it impossible to instill pregnancy.
Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not recognize that placenta residue remained or did not take all measures to prevent endometrial damage despite the suspicion of placenta residue in the womb, it is possible that this is medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.
Birth Death
The death of a newborn during childbirth is fairly rare.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family sadly becomes the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the newborn in a timely manner or respond belatedly to such bleeding.
"For example..."In that case, the medical team ignored and failed to respond to the mother's alarming vital signs, for long hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the background disease from which she suffered, "Reif-Liganza said.
"In another case..."Our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after the birth of twins due to bleeding that originated from the caesarean section that was not properly sewn.
In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the surgery, but the medical team did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, she responded late only after her systems began to fail, leading to her death."
Uterine loss
In severe cases, medical malpractice in childbirth can lead to a hysterectomy, says Attorney Rafe Lingza:"Our firm has conducted a lawsuit against a hospital that is based on hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.
In the same case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper care for the massive bleeding observed by the medical team after birth and yet no action was taken in time that could have prevented the damage."
What are the damages awarded in medical malpractice lawsuits at birth?
Neonatal compensation for injury due to medical malpractice at birth includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts given for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, loss of wages and pensions to the injured person and even his parents, and other components of damage.
The compensation paid to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average salary in the economy.
In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitative accessories, the cost of adjusting housing for the needs of the baby, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances,"says Attorney Reif-Liganza,adding that "today most of the claims on the grounds of medical malpractice are settled in a compromise that takes into account the chance and risk each party has in conducting the procedure." Then if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and, for example, as part of a lawsuit managed by our firm, the District Court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress a compensation in excess of 10 million shekels."
In summary
Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney skilled at handling claims on the grounds of medical malpractice, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of keratoconus eye disease in the South
Research has suggested there is a link between the development of the disease and close marriage •
The highest incidence was found in the Bedouin sector •
Expert:"It may be that in any sector with a lot of cousin weddings, there is a high incidence of the disease."
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible and find the right solutions to prevent the condition from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted to help understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new research provides research basis for the suspicion that the eye disease keratoconus is a genetic disease.
A recent study, which dealt with turning the shape of the cornea from a dome to a cone, found that the cause of the disease and the weakness of the cornea and the deformity of its shape is related to an enzyme imbalance, in which the free radicals can damage the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The source of this enzyme deficiency is genetic, which reinforces the hypothesis that keratocanus is an inherited disease.
According to Prof. Ariella Gordon-Shag, head of the Department of Optometry Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, "In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a incidence of keratoconus was found to be 3.2%.
The highest prevalence was in Bedouin students - 20% had keratoconus, but there was a relatively small sample."
The researcher added that this was not a surprising finding: "There is a large incidence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that close marriage is a risk factor for keratoconus disease.
So in any sector with a lot of cousin weddings, we may find a high incidence."
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: In cases where a family story of keratoconus disease appears, all family members should get a proper eye exam as soon as possible.
According to Arza Fruchter, clinical optometrist B.Sc"There is ten times as much appeal to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, especially the south, as from the centre."
Fruchter adds, " Over the past decade, I have noticed that most patients are evacuated from the periphery, especially from the Be'er Sheva area.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriage within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of the proper treatment of the problem."
So how do you diagnose the disease?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or late teens (ages 15-16 or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, concurrently with an increase in the cylinder.
Keratoconus patients show distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These signs are exacerbated by the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease may also develop rapidly and reach its peak in just a few months.
Many patients also show increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the Gaza operation, the IDF revealed the name of Lt. Col. M. Bennett:"Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel"
Mahmoud Khair al-Din from the village of Khurfish is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in the operation in Khan Younis •
"He deserves the publicity, his family and his children deserve." •
Next, the possibility of publishing a photograph of Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from the General Staff Patrol will be examined.
About three and a half years after the operation that entangled Khan Younis, the IDF today permits publication that the casualty in the operation, Lt. Col. M., is the late Lt. Col. Mahmoud Khir a-Din from the village of Hurfish in the north.
He was 41 when he fell.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "It has been three and a half years since the late Lt. Gen. Mahmoud Hir al-Din was killed in battle in a secret operation in Khan Younis, and only now can we reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to state security.
"The late Mahmoud was a fighter in a paratrooper patrol and later rose through the ranks of the army to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF Special Operations Division.
A hero of Israel who was posthumously decorated with the shadow of the Chief of Staff.
"I eulogized him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and face of the hero of Israel, Lt. Col. Mahmoud Hir al-Din, openly.
The environment looked up to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion conducted by the head of the Intelligence Division, Gen. Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censors, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khir al-Din, a hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977, in the village of Hurfish in the Upper Galilee, the firstborn son of his parents, Ahmed and a nun, with seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahed and had two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the Special Operations Division of the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Khir ad-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked to him.
Until the ninth grade, he attended the school in Kfar Hurfish, and then transferred to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he enlisted in a paratrooper patrol and graduated from officer school in 2000.
In 2002, he was tracked down by the Special Operations Unit in the IM and moved to serve there.
While serving, he earned a bachelor's degree in Law from the College of Management and a Master's degree in Education and Business Administration from the University of Haifa.
He met his wife Nahed in 2002 and they married in 2004.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends established a nonprofit that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the "Aharai" association and began guiding a group in Kfar Hurfish, after he arranged for the organization to start operating in the Druze villages to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013, his second son was born.
Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "This is when we become involved in the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din, the hero of Israel.
We have completed work and have concluded that there is no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.
He also deserves it, his family and his children," he said.
"An Exceptional Educator and Leader"
"Thanks to many operations he is nothing short of a hero in my eyes," said Gen Haliva.
"He has made a significant contribution, with courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He should get the right place for him."
He added:"I didn't know him personally, but he was an educator, an exceptional educator and leader - not only on the operational side, but also in my values."
Gen. Haliva said he would also examine whether to publish the picture of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno of the General Staff Patrol, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose picture was not allowed to be published.
The operation in Khan Younis took place on 11 November 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of painstaking preparations by the intelligence community.
In the command unit of the operation were the then-Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Gadi Eisenkot, the then-head of the Military Intelligence Agency, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heyman, and the then-head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been made public, and the IDF stressed that it was an operation whose intelligence value was invaluable.
But the Arab media showed in retrospect communications equipment that the Palestinians said had been left behind by the forces.
Hamas claimed the operation was aimed at planting listening devices.
According to reports, on the day of the incident, the force was travelling in two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas officials, and something about their behavior raised the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The on-the-ground investigation lasted about 45 minutes, during which time it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized it was in a difficult situation, Lt. Col. Hir A-Din managed to distract the Hamas men, and in a split second the force commander, Lt. Col. A., managed to open fire.
From the fire, three Hamas members were killed, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.
Ten months after the serious incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the CPL. Committee and award the Chief of Staff's commendation to three of the combatants in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip - among them the late Lt. Col. Khir al-Din.
The commander of the fighting force and another fighter in the team also received a commendation.
In a statement, the army said Lt. Col. M. received the commendation for"his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, in defense of his comrades.
Later, he acted with initiative and striving for contact, took a forward role in taking over the enemy and acted resourcefully to promote the takeover.
Consider transitioning from a tweezer operation to an extensive operation
Israel needs to ask itself, again, if it is wrong to change policy against the Jenin sector •
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would fuel and ignite the West Bank in its wake, but the Jenin gunmen may leave it no choice.
The turbulent weekend we have been through shows that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the terrain is still more volatile than ever.
It will take great efforts and common sense to safely cross the two upcoming mention dates: the"Nakba" Day, which begins today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day, which will be marked in two weeks.
Quite a few factors will stand by in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
In their minds, as always, are the terrorist elements, who are concentrating a special effort in trying to preserve the violent atmosphere of the past few weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the SWAT fighter, the late Sergeant Major Noam Raz, was killed.
Fighters who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they could not remember such a scale of shooting and violence - a testament not only to the tremendous amount of weapons on the ground, but also to the willingness to use them.
This requires Israel to ask itself, again, if it is wrong to change policy in the Jenin sector, and to move from small, intelligence-based operations to a large, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would fuel and ignite the West Bank and the entire arena in its wake; even now, the security establishment prefers to act selectively, when necessary, in order to avoid conflagration, but the Jenin gunmen may not leave it with a choice.
Learn the lessons for future events.
Raz's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims that it deliberately killed Al־Jazeera journalist Shirin Abu Aqla.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and those who attend the scene.
The IDF takes tremendous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocents as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of combatants.
This indicates high morality, but it also has operational and intelligence value: a terrorist captured alive־as happened the day before yesterday in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about weapons, attacks, and other terrorists; it is information that is often not obtained in any other way, and through which it is possible to thwart the following attacks.
The IDF acted correctly when it published the interim investigation it conducted in the case of Abu Aqla's death, clarifying that it is not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful that it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the case.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with empathy for the victims of Palestinian terror - the original grounds for which the IDF is constantly operating in Jenin.
As ever, the nature of such stories perish.
World public opinion is preoccupied with hers and moving on, certainly as Ukraine continues to rage a war many times more intense.
Therefore, it is a shame that Israel insisted on giving the affair of Abu Aqla's death another unnecessary moment of exposure, with the police's mishandling of her funeral.
Even if Abu־Aqla's family did not live up to the earlier summaries, a little more forbearance should have been expected from the police officers who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less excited by the Palestinian flags that flew there.
The responsibility is to act to calm the situation.
The Public security minister and the police commissioner ordered an investigation into the incident.
It seems to lack sufficient preparation and clear guidelines, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short time, and in two different districts.
In the Dizengoff attack, police also failed to manage the event, isolate the scene and handle the media.
The Commission of inquiry will do well if it is not only satisfied with analyzing the conduct of the police officers at the funeral itself, but also producing lessons and conclusions that will enable a more successful handling of similar incidents in the future.
Along with the internal handling of the police, he also pledges to address the conduct of elected officials who have lost way and direction.
The Israeli Knesset currently has several members who are seen as a danger to democracy.
They are on the left and the right, using their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Kasif is the latest example of this; if no action is taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the state will implicitly encourage the next elected official to further radicalize his actions.
Such moves, which are tantamount to defensive democracy, are essential in the explosive nature of this period, when in the background elements seek to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with common sense in his head is expected to rise above all these things and act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel may quickly slide into escalation against enemies from outside, and worse, against opponents from home.
Senior Police Official: "Government policies and goals are required here"
The Israeli police have launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal aliens, but the road is still a long one •
There is not a single element in the State of Israel today that includes this whole issue.""
"If the phenomenon of illegal aliens is to be addressed, government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities must be derived.
Today, there is not a single element in the State of Israel that includes this whole issue," a senior police official told Israel Hayom.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation of the security situation, the phenomenon was expressed in about 20 to 30 thousand IPS who enter every day through the gaps in the fence.
In addition, between 100 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day through 34 supervised crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each industry is limited by a quota set by the political echelons in accordance with the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, the Shin Bet is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to the attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians whose entry has been banned because they do not meet the permitted quota of permits.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were considered to be Shin Bet prisoners, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required the security forces to monitor their movements.
"Therefore, there is no significance to their entry through the loopholes in the fence, "says a senior security official," Anyone who wants to carry out an attack can enter Israel even through the supervised crossings, and there have been cases like this before.
Thousands of arrests
Following the attack in Elad and in light of the multiplicity of terror attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal aliens.
By the end of the week, about 16,000 people had been arrested.
Of those, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases opened, and about 200 were jailed.
Under the Police prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal aliens are only carried out against prone criminals or people who repeatedly repeat the act (recidivists).
An illegal immigrant arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes this is repeated a second time, but only for the third time has he been arrested, imprisoned and charged with unlawful residence.
According to the law, if an illegal immigrant is caught within 50 to 100 meters of each side of the separation fence, his treatment is carried out by the military prosecution.
According to data obtained by Israel Hayom, in 2021, 40,010 illegal aliens, shippers and informants were dealt with by the police.
7,405 illegals were arrested and 19,533 had criminal records opened.
The number of employers, movers and shakers dealt with by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 had criminal cases opened.
"The foundations of the Shin Bet phenomenon do not depend on the police, not the IDF, not on Israeli society and not on Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors, " says a senior law enforcement official.
"In order to address this phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be sterilized, and the Israeli side must charge them a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.
Officials involved in the case argue that the failure to collect the toll is due, among other things, to the lack of places of detention and the fact that arrests are made only when there are related offenses or it is a serious crime.
Legal sources say that the decision to charge the Shin Bet only from his third arrest was made in part because the courts cannot deal with the number of arrests made every day.
Anyone who examines the punishment will find that it is not a deterrent.""
There is a great complexity
"He is a complex man, "a police official said.
He could be a father of a family who entered the country to work in order to earn a few shekels and come back.
This is the basic platform, and on it are dressed many types of prisoners who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks."
It can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, 16-year-old illegals have been caught by the police, and even 8-and 10-year-olds are sent by their parents to intersections on the roads, in order to earn a few shekels a day from drivers.
"It also makes the matter complex, because in cases like this we have to bring the parents and charge them with neglect," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical or advanced construction jobs.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed waste disposal experts, especially in the north.
Of the 34 crossings, there are about 18 major ones.
There are crossings of vehicles and goods, there are crossings that pass through only people and there are crossings that are both.
All crossings are monitored by the IDF and the Crossing Authority.
The IPS are usually driven into the country by private drivers, since it is easy money.
"There are some who do this for a living and there are gangs whose main business is transporting prisoners,"says a senior police official," usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can reach 100 to 300 shekels per person.
Listed companies do not deal with this, because if the company is caught, it will be closed."
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, driving an IPS can be considered an offense.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licenses and insurance, who collects Palestinians at orderly points and at regular hours, including an arranged order, does not break the law," says a senior police official, "Someone who knows he is driving a Shabbat, usually picks them up in the dead of night at hiding points, including dropping them off at hidden points.
Most of these guys drive with a clunky car because they know they're going to be impounded, so they prefer to drive in an old car."

"A criminal investigation should be opened against her": Haifa City Comptroller on serious charges against Einat Kalish Rotem
The City Comptroller's report presents a concern about alleged criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials and political rivals: surveillance of employees and inflated payments to an accountant's office for carrying out the investigations •
"The harsh findings of the report require the opening of a criminal investigation." •
The City of Haifa had no comment.
Surveillance of municipal employees and political rivals and inflated payments to an accountant's office for carrying out investigations, "at the expense of the public coffers."
The report of Haifa Municipal Comptroller Ofer Tal, published yesterday (Tuesday), presents a concern about alleged criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
According to the suspicion, Kalish met with the accountant's office at Barlev & Co.and asked to carry out an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to councilwoman Sophie Nekesh, and it was examined whether the tenders held between the municipality and a company owned by Nekesh's family were kosher.
The auditor's report also shows that there is a complete lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal official whose job it is to concentrate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments and the data collected by the accountant was not transferred to him.
This has resulted in no one in the municipality being aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and the extent of the work required in each of them.
Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation was created in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved increased disproportionately, with a great deal of interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and surveillance on the part of the municipality.
In summing up the report, the audit recommended halting the unpaid payments to the accountant until material detailing his work on each of the issues he examined was received.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were under codes such as "gatekeepers", an information store, a fish shop, an investigative audit for the mayor and an investigative procurement audit report.
Shortly after, the city's attorney, attorney Marine Klein, noted that the mayor had signed the payment herself instead.
"I have not been commissioned by any audit report and I do not know what this is about,"she wrote.
It was also reported that the cost of the investigative audit was about two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels were paid, with half a million shekels left to be paid, from the tax money of the Haifa public.
Former city Treasurer Jackie Wakim responded: "These despicable actions taken to smear the name and reputation of elected officials at the expense of the public coffers and the taxpayer are a criminal offence."
City Council member Sophie Knecht said: "The auditor's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves."
Attorney Sarit Golan, a member of the Haifa City Council: The hard evidence and findings from the report call for the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the consultant for investigative review to carry out investigations, some of which doubt whether they are permitted by law in the way they were carried out and in particular the investigations relating to the council member from the opposition to the mayor and former senior employees."
Lior Datz of the "Gatekeepers" association: "It seems that all red lines have been crossed that the public authority sends investigators details in order to gather information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption while the association is conducting public proceedings against the Haifa Municipality administration."
The City of Haifa declined to comment.
Accountant Yehuda Barlev's office did not wish to comment.
Gantz revealed: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm UNIFIL's activities in Lebanon"
The Defense Minister attended the International cyber Conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that " Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation." •
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of El-Sayed in Hamas captivity: "A video aimed at blackmail – on the back of a humanitarian issue." •
Deputy Commander of 8200 Unit revealed: 'We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems'
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke at the International Cyber Center conference at Tel Aviv University, where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to hit the UNIFIL forces in Lebanon,"further harm by Iran and Hezbollah to the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the country,"Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hisham al-Sayed, a Hamas prisoner in Gaza who was released by the terrorist organization's military wing: "Yesterday, a video aimed at blackmail was released – on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four boys captive in violation of international law and against morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal behavior by Hamas."
"The State of Israel is working through a variety of means, and continues to leave no stone unturned in order to bring the boys home.
As we have said before – this is a humanitarian issue, that's how we see it, and on that basis we will continue to act.
Attempts at blackmail and exercises of consciousness will not affect our position and conduct."
Later, he revealed joint activity between Iran and Hezbollah: "Iran is also operating its affiliates in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recently, Iranian security agencies detected activity in cooperation with Hezbollah in order to harm the activities of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This was accomplished through the implementation of a cyber operation aimed at stealing materials on the deployment of UNIFL in the region, and using them by Hezbollah.
This is another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the Lebanese people, and on the stability of Lebanon."
"Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their methods of operation.
"In recent years, we have seen a phenomenon of hacker groups on behalf of Iran, which operate against Israel and other countries," Gantz said.
"The' new apostles ' are keyboard terrorists who are judged like the fighters of other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we are hurting them and their emissaries, and even today they are in our sights – and not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack against Israeli citizens will move to the agenda.
And the responsibility lies with the attackers and the state that funds and sends them.
Cyber attacks can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and other areas."
Gantz continued his attack on the nuclear power: "Iran is leading cyber terrorism – and making moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and administrations, as happened in the U.S. presidential election and other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Operations such as that of the Shahid Kahwa unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under the direct direction of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards as revealed in the interrogations."
"In recent years, we have blocked many attempts to break into private and public companies, both in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber responsibility', and to punish companies and entities that do not follow the guidelines."
Gantz went on to highlight Israel's next goals in the face of threats: "Our supreme task, in the military, in the industries and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
I and the Chief of Staff have placed this issue as one of the central tasks in the relevant units.
We examine the building of the force all the time – both in the scope of the personnel, in the subject of training and in the subject of tasks.
In the coming years, we will also need to examine the organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system."
Finally, the defense minister concluded by calling for cooperation with the world: "Our cooperation with the world is of great importance in the cyber dimension as well.
The same cooperation we are building in the region with Iran in terms of defense against various threats – we are expanding in the cyber dimension as well."
The deputy commander of the 8200 unit revealed:"We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems."
Uri, deputy commander of Unit 8200, said the unit's first public appearance at such conferences revealed that Israel had foiled an attack on water systems.
"Cyber threats are a key part of our operations.
Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and to take action to negate his abilities," said 8200 Deputy Commander, adding, "We also sometimes find victims outside of Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and by partnering with industry and other agencies, through implementation and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed."
As stated, this revealed a threat to Israel's water systems and attempts to poison Israeli citizens: "We thwarted the attempt to take over and poison Israel's critical water systems several years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a particular opponent had attacked Israel, and in the process we identified that the same attacker had also tried to target power plants in the United States.
It was the first indication of this attack.
We have managed to prevent this threat by working closely with our American partners."
Watch: Police prepare to Eliminate terrorists in civilian population
The Jerusalem Border Police inaugurates a new "Assaf" facility that simulates shooting in a crowded crowd in response to the string of attacks that have taken place in recent months •
Border Patrol's Counter-Terrorism Guide wraps up in Jerusalem: "The development provides a relevant response to the attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground" •
A glimpse of the "Assaf"facility
Preparing for the next attack: A series of terrorist attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, during which 19 people were killed and about 70 civilians were wounded, led the Border Guard to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to attack terrorists within a civilian population and carry out shooting in traffic.
Israel Hayom Exposure: A Glimpse of the "Assaf"facility
Popular terrorism focuses on harming civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security needed to lead a normal life of a civilian population.
The wave of serious attacks that took place this year, with attacks in Be'er Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on the busy Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist embedded in a crowd, led the police to creative thinking in order to develop a tool that could be used to train fighters to attack terrorists within a civilian population.
The work was led by the training Division of the Police and Border Patrol.
This was followed by a competition in the various police districts under the title "Commanders Lead Learning," in which each district was required to develop measures to help improve the policing and fighting skills of combatants, police officers and commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need for the training of Border Guards to fight in motion and in such scenarios, Assaf Ben David, a counter-terrorism instructor of the Jerusalem-based Border Police developed the"Assaf Device", which consists of a dynamic target, attached to a telescopic pole with a carrier that can be harnessed to the instructor.
As they guide the carrier to death, they can practice the warrior in front of them by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Police fighters and fighters have dealt with many attacks, including the bomber, who performs a shooting and poses a threat while moving in scenes saturated with innocent civilians.
The "Assaf Facility", in its current version, is based on components and parts used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic pole, which was upgraded and integrated into the facility, was taken from the field of maintenance and cleaning.
Using the device, it is possible to simulate shooting in motion within a civilian population at a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling a traffic stop, choosing a path of progress and carrying out selective firing including the practice of preventing harm to uninvolved persons.
Maj. Gen. Assaf Ben-David, whose facility is named after him, says: "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in the learning and training of combatants and police officers.
The development provides a relevant response to attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of development versus the relatively cheap cost of production gives us a significant advantage in competition."
State Auditor warns: "Central Election Commission is not prepared for cyber threats"
Benjamin Netanyahu warned during International Cyber Week against Israel's unpreparedness for cyberattacks •
"World War III will be a hacker war, but the world is not prepared for it."
Israel's Comptroller, Netanyahu Engelmann, attended Tel Aviv University's annual cyber conference on Wednesday and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
"We are exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it."
Engelman said that in the framework of the cyber reviews conducted by his office, significant deficiencies were found: "In the past year, we conducted penetration tests at the Traffic management Center in Jerusalem, hospitals and the Tax Authority's systems.
In the reviews we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were carried out by public bodies and some conducted penetration tests only during the audit.
In addition, deficiencies in the preparedness of the Central Election Commission for cyber threats have increased."
"We at the State Comptroller's Office are committed to continuing to address this significant issue more vigorously, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world," he concluded.
"I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles"
"From the first moment they showed me they wanted me, I was built to lead a great team." •
Returning to the Israel national team after four years: "I felt like I had a place, I wanted to be in the squad for EuroBasket" •
And the time at Maccabi Tel Aviv: "I learned to focus only on what I had in my control" •
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will travel today with the players of the Israeli national team to Poland, where they will meet the local team in qualifying for the 2023 World Cup (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia at the Solomon Group Arena.
In addition to the intensive training with the national team, Blazer also discussed his future in the past week, until he signed a two-year contract with Hapoel Jerusalem.
"I have a quiet mind now that I have found a team,"he told Israel Hayom in his first and special interview since signing.
"I have a bit of pressure now because I have to move with my family after settling in the centre area and it's not easy, but there are no phones anymore and professionally I'm much more relaxed."
You haven't been in the team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to enjoy the team and I come in with the attitude of contributing in everything I can, whether it's from my experience and whether it's on the pitch.
Of course I would love to play, but when you get to the team everyone has to put their ego aside and do everything to make the team successful.
I'm here for what they need from me."
You are now 14 players, and the European champions will be joined by Dani Avadia, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and there may be other changes as well.
Have you set your sights on being on the championship roster?
"I would love to be on the pitch and contribute."
The 29־year-old Blazer (1 1.99 m) has played the last two years for Maccabi Tel Aviv.
When the season ended it was clear that he would not continue with yellow and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring the Jerusalemites to Hapoel Holon.
You had other suggestions, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem?
"They showed great willingness to have me there, so it was a relatively easy negotiation.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach I realised this was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and appropriate.
I'm here to lead and be a big part of the team.
I've spoken to the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and winning, and that's exactly what I bring.
I've always loved playing in the arena, because I get energy even with the crowd is against me, and now that they will be on my side it will be even better.
I'm sure it will be a committed and fun group and I wanted to be a part of that."
Expand on your conversation with Coach Dzicic.
"Professionally, he believes in a lot of movement without the ball.He plans to bring a lot of good passing with Aye.Cue high basketball and a very intense team.
He believes in high energy in defence and attack and with the crowd in the arena it can work."
I looked at your career and saw that every team has at least two years left, if not longer.
Do you feel like you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
"Everywhere I go I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem my phone didn't stop ringing and beeping.
I've had a lot of messages waiting for me.
So I believe we have a good time ahead of us."
Do you think Jerusalem can be a more significant player than Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you sum up the two years at the TA?
"There were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained a professional all the way through, and no matter how much I got - I always gave everything.
I'm proud of the way I've done over the last year, and now everyone's going their own way."
If it were up to you, would you want to stay in the car?
"After the last year, it was clear to both sides that we were going in the direction of separation, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I hurt a bit in the minutes and my status dropped, although in the middle of the year I had a great run, but they decided to go in other directions.
After understanding the situation there, I realized it was less the place for me.
"Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it."
Finally, what are your goals for the coming season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the cup semi - final last season when I shouted to Ami Bitton, 'This is why I'm here,' so this is why I came to Jerusalem – to take titles."

Jerusalem decided not to exercise the option of Retin Obasanjo.
Hapoel Tel Aviv is looking into the possibility of bringing Adam Ariel in if he is released from Hapoel Jerusalem.
As you may recall, a few days ago we reported that the 27-year-old forward's future at the Jerusalem club is in doubt and it is possible that the team will take advantage of the option to exit his contract, with a final decision to be made in the coming days.
It is now clear that if he does not continue in the capital, Hapoel Tel Aviv will try to sign him in its ranks.
And in Jerusalem, the club's leaders decided not to exercise the option on Retin Obasanjo's contract for another season and informed him of his release from the team.
Meanwhile, defender Raz Adam may be loaned out to City's Ness Ziona after asking to leave the Reds to get more playing minutes.

All or Nothing: 1:1 Between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadid scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but made amends with an equaliser 10 minutes later •
The midfielder was later red carded (74) •
Hadera was also left with ten players due to red for Ido Levy's charge (87)
Hapoel Jerusalem's professional staff counted the number of foreigners on the lawn in Teddy, much more than once, it should be noted, and at one point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was banned).
This time, to their delight, all was well, and the 1:1 they achieved against Hapoel Hadera will not be taken from them by the Association's tribunal.
Before his red card, he scored an own goal and equalised to set up a precious point for Ziv Arya.
In the 33rd minute, Guy Hadid's private show began.
Palkushchenko charged wide, and the midfielder rose and rammed the ball into his team's net.
0-1 to Hadera who enjoyed a goal of his own.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hiddink was able to make amends and in the giant - Levkovic caught air and the midfielder this time rammed into the right and exposed net.
1: 1 in Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hiddink also picked up a second yellow and a red, this time after sliding in the direction of Marmentini.
Daniel Bar Nathan decided on a dubious red and sent the midfielder straight into an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Nathan also sent on Ido Levy and levelled the scores on the grass.
Recovery Department: Eilat beat Holon
60:85
Ariel Beit Lahmai's team notched a third straight win, this time especially impressive •
Hoover and Schuchman (15 CA) Excelled
Hapoel Eilat's journey of recovery continued this evening (Saturday night) with an impressive 85:60 victory over Hapoel Holon en route to a 0-3 season record in the meetings between the two.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel's team has been with three straight wins, and in fact this is a surprise only for those who did not watch the game.
We haven't seen this bad in a long time.
All this before the series opener against Besiktas in the Champions Cup: just 60 points, a first half without a three-pointer and 11 per cent to three in the entire game.
Bottom line: an unimpressive night by all the team's players (except Murphy Manko, who made Holon's 3-pointers), including safety Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in much better shape thanks to Roy Huber and Joaquin Schuchman (15 points CA).
The first bounced back in the final period and the second came back to flourish and also stunned with a three-quarter-court basket.
Give them a Chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv Israelis save Seferopoulos
After a Derby loss and an eighth consecutive European defeat, a Clasico defeat against Jerusalem would probably end the long love affair between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach •
So who does Yannis have to send a bouquet of flowers to tonight?
For his Israeli team, who were responsible for a crucial 42 points at the Arena •
Also: Why the Yellow Club needs to change its 'Americanization strategy', and take a vivid example from Ariel Beit Lahmi's model in Eilat
It is hard to remain cynical at the sight of the teary eyes and the warm and strong hugs given to his players at the end of tonight's game at the Arena, especially in the face of the tight grip and secret exchange with John Dibertholmau, who single-handedly saved the Greek coach his job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after a home defeat in the Derby and an eighth in a row in Europe, to also lose in the Clasico and move away from it to three wins in the table?
That would have ended the Israeli-Greek affair by tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he's got a lot to learn from this game, also and really mostly about the Euroleague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change in the habits of attacking and moving the ball.
The ball moved in passing, with lots of movement and drills, and Scotty Wilbekin, demonstrably, left the focus to Evans, dribbling very little, mostly passing blocks and making shots.
Despite scoring badly (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed defensively, and mostly, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team reverted to old habits, and the attacks reverted back to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a 2 and 40 seconds to go, Scotty dribbled himself to half a corner and threw a floater on one leg that almost lost the game.
The trick is to keep playing tricks and passing especially in the clutch moments, and that has to go into the nature and team DNA.
The important learning will be done by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who have become water-vacuums and towel-waving at European games.
Tonight they scored more than half of their team's points (42 of 83), and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of Maccabi's top five scorers were Israelis.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can help in the Euroleague as well.
In the first half it was mostly Hawthorn, who have been crying out for a month that they must play more.
Shooting, passing, fighting under baskets (7 rebounds), 2 yards of defensive determination and game wisdom.
Isn't that enough?
The second half starred Jake Cohen, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and covering for an injury to Zajic, and especially John Dee, who at 70-63 changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.
Yannis has a complicated relationship with Yiftach Ziv, and it seems that at times he gives him too much credit, and burdens him too much, to the point of risking loss.
It happens in the Euroleague, and it happened tonight, too.
But the important learning has to be the club's about its Americanisation strategy.
Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ganat and Yam Mader went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dvrat chooses Jerusalem, or maybe he was rejected by Maccabi.
And this is happening because Maccabi is gradually being left with fewer places for Israelis, because of an informed and grassroots choice by the club to base itself on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play in it, and then it will look for Jewish children to become naturalized, and pressure the principal/association to increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake by the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it is exaggerating with the foreigners, much because of the tax break.
Certainly we wouldn't argue that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones.
This season, for example, with Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, you could have two stars (star point guard and super forward) who are effective and stable next to Scotty and Zizic.
It will be more effective, it will be more true, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and generates empathy.
It's true that there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even receives tax relief from the state for its pretend representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association/league administration can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 on the roster, 4 on form, maximum three on the field at the same time.
Is it for the ongoing failed achievements (already seven years in Europe), just for Maccabi, that the league is awash with foreigners?
And the players Union, what about you?
Is that why you sat down?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there is one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargain to get less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in the above direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, plus 4 Israelis who were only two in the young teams (Huber, Ben Moshe, Ruina and Shochman the Fighter), she dismantled Holon (second in the table! For the second time in two weeks.
It is a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run in the days of Dan Shamir and much in the days of Sharon Drucker.
Short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is nothing like Ariel Beit Lahmi, who started out on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their best, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The foreigners only make up.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from knee injuries, it will be a tremendous team.
A song I dreamed of in Eilat.
You can learn from him on the right track.
"There was a feeling that the whole world was against us."
The Yellows are happy after the 83-78 win over Hapoel Jerusalem in the Arena: "We returned to play like Maccabi Tel Aviv should play" •
On the talk of Ami Bitton in the dressing room, the optimistic first diagnosis of the Dzeko injury and the management's approval of the acquisition.
A great sense of relief is registered this morning (Sunday) among the Maccabi Tel Aviv personnel after the important and prestigious 78:83 yesterday at the Hapoel Jerusalem Arena.
The team's players and management hugged coach Yannis Seferopoulos, who looked very excited at the finish.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer enthusiastically poured water on the game's outstanding Derrick Williams, and the rest of the team smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure had been released after the recent losing streak.
They, too, feared defeat against the great rival that would further undermine the system.
Fans also stayed long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
"We and Yannis have an amazing connection in the locker room," Oz said.
"We know the situation was not easy for him either, a lot of pressure came out.
We were really looking forward to it, even in the way we played.
We came back to play the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play, with heart and fight, we stand behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us."
Before the game manager Ami Bitton went into the dressing room and made an emotional speech to the players.
"His stuff had a big impact on how we went out and how we played on the floor," Maccabi said.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi are already aiming for the important game against Basconia on Thursday and want to end the longest losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the last few games we've been under a lot of pressure," Yannis told us. " If we get loose we'll win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
"A lot of eyes were on us and it was a feeling of the whole world against us, I'm proud to go to this war, we cut off all around and look only at ourselves."
Ante Zijic, who injured his right knee in the final quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the dressing room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
Doctors will see how the knee reacts today and then it will become clear how many days of rest he will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Basconia.
Apart from the strong backing given from the management to Seferopolos and the professional staff, at a meeting held on Thursday, manager Nikola Vucic was given the green light to bring in one or two players to strengthen the squad, and the Yellows hope to bring in a quality acquisition soon.
Anthony Bennett released from Hapoel Jerusalem
The forward, who was selected first in the NBA draft, was unable to acclimate to the team from the Capitals. •
The club said in a statement: "Anthony has entered the hearts of all of us, thanking him for his time at Hapoel."
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released from the team on Sunday.
The 28-year-old forward, who was selected first overall in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, posted 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five NBA games, as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight NBA games.
"Hapoel Jerusalem and player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision to terminate the player's contract at the club," the club said in a statement, "Anthony entered the hearts of all of us and we would like to thank him for his time at Hapoel.
Wish him well and success."
Study states: Zoom meetings hurt creativity
Some 2,100 engineers and academics around the world have been asked to develop solutions to the problem-some in video sessions, some in face-to-face meetings •
Result: Virtual meeting impairs creativity and thinking outside the box •
Study leader at Columbia University: "The visual focus on the screen impairs the idea-making process" •
There is no harm to productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of video-software encounters on the creativity of participants, compared to face-to-face encounters.
Unfortunately, creativity has been found to be impaired in virtual meetings through screens.
The question of the study - led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University - was whether remote computer meetings preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of the distance.
The study itself began as early as 2016 but received a big boost in the two years, during which many workers moved to work from home.
"People in a personal meeting move around the room, use objects and use them for creative thinking," Brooks says.
"In a computer session, however, the concentration in maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which impairs the broad and expansive idea-making process."
Space is narrowing.
To test the results and see if they would be repeated, they were tested twice – once at Columbia University and again in real life - on engineers who knew each other from early acquaintance.
At the university, the researchers divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts: in one, the subjects were asked to meet in person and develop solutions to the problem, and in the other, they were asked to do so through a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to share similarly and solve in a new way a problem presented to them.
In both cases, there was a decline in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who had met on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoc at McGill University in Canada and a researcher on ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his view, as part of a thinking activity, people often look at their surroundings to help create ideas, whereas in a video session the thinking converges to the screen rather than expanding in a way that allows creativity.
"When people are in the same room, they look around them and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can give them new associations.
On the other hand, research shows that relationships through a computer change our attention so that we are more focused on the inside and the screen, and this reduces innovation and idea creation through looking at the environment and thinking outwards."
There is no impediment to critical thinking.
However, before managers run employees back to the offices, the researchers note that "working through a computer did not damage productivity itself nor people's critical thinking on innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.
That is, the harm is focused on creativity only and not on the other forms of work in front of a computer."
Ellen Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also disputed the findings.
She said:"There is a difference between just creativity, like new uses for frisbee (one of the research questions; AG), and solutions of work.
It may also be that when employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or work from home, creativity will improve."
Both Prof Langer and Dr Olson also suggested future research in which such meetings would be stopped for states of mind and wandering around the room to see how this activity would affect the end result.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study only for brainstorming sessions, employees would return to work, and as a rule he suggested not to be alarmed by one study but to do more research in the field.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forcibly returned and not be happy is a bigger hit," he says.
Musk on Trump's return: 'It wasn't right to block him'
Twitter's fresh purchaser said it would reverse the decision, which led to the former US president's account being blocked •
"I think it was a mistake," he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter in a deal valued at 4 44 billion, said Tuesday that he plans to return Trump to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, after a riot by his supporters on Capitol Hill following his election loss to Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake," he said.
"If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and a suspension - a temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban," Musk said.
By 2050, the world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture.
New global study predicts major decline in next 25 years •
The Solution: Proper management of water reserves
A disturbing new study published recently in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050, the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the pace of water consumption and population growth remain at their current usage trends.
In the study, which involved scientists from all the world's scientific agencies, the scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The grim conclusions of the study show that currently the rate of water consumption has doubled over and over the past 10 years, with global warming causing fewer rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study, 84% of the land designated for agriculture in the world will experience heavy rainwater shortages.
One of the key conclusions of the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and the seasons, and to move to growing methods that will make it easier for water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the evaporation process that will lead to widespread waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater collection technologies to prevent their flow to the sea.
Information about many Bar Ilan University students leaked online
Hackers who attacked Bar Ilan University's database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the students ' information if they did not receive a ransom. •
The threat was realised and the information was posted across the network.
Students at Bar Ilan University came under attack from hackers when their personal information was posted across the web by an attacker known as Darkrypt, who a few weeks ago issued a ransom demand from the university and threatened that if he was not paid an undisclosed amount of money, he would publish the information under his control.
Estimates of the amount of money demanded by the attacker are that it began in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked, it went up and before the information was published it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are filled with angry messages and the chaos is unfolding there, with students unable to access their personal information systems and unable to carry out regular student assignments.
The university sent an e-mail message informing the academic institution of the attack and that they were working intensively to minimize the damage, while detailing some of the information that had leaked online.
No specific instructions were given to those whose information had been hacked and it said the university had carried out a series of actions to strengthen security measures on the University's servers.
In line for 40 localities: Fiber Optic reaches Binyamin
The trend of high-speed internet connectivity continues and now the fiber optic is coming to the Binyamin Council, which includes 40 localities •
The project in collaboration with the Council and telecommunications companies Telran, X-Fiber and Rimon Internet will get underway right after the holidays.
Binyamin Council signed a broad agreement of its kind at the weekend to lay fiber optics in all council communities.
The agreement with Net-Fiber in cooperation with Rimon, Telran and X-Fiber was signed after the conclusion of a large tender that the Council worked on in recent months.
The work will begin after the holidays and residents from 40 council communities who would like to connect to the fiber optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 gigabyte as well as advanced home end equipment that will enable strong WIFI reception, as required during these times.
Entrants will be able to choose between high-speed internet over fiber optics or high-speed filtered Internet over fiber optics that they will provide over the Internet.
The Council has been careful to ensure that the market remains open to competition under any circumstances.
The head of the Binyamin Regional Council, Yisrael Gantz: "This is true Zionism.
This is great news for residents.
The experience of life in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to study remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and set up advanced businesses in communities that will receive quality internet and without delays.
I would like to wish the companies good luck in their execution missions.
The people are waiting for you."
Gantz added: "We will soon get proper conditions for the best high-speed internet in Israel.
We worked for many months to bring a foundation to install the fiber and now the vision is becoming a reality.

We looked at: What do the side effects after the coronavirus vaccine mean?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weakness, fever and fatigue after getting the shot, while others feel nothing •
Could this indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these symptoms, or is this a unfounded rumor?
As more and more people get vaccinated, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are untrue.
Is the immune system of those who have developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies have responded less harshly to the vaccine, which might prove that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body that has entered the body?
"There are several levels of responses to the vaccine,"says Dr. David Dvir, head of the United Primary Medicine Department and a member of the advisory committee for the CTM (Pandemic Treatment Team), reassuring:"Headaches, fatigue, pain in the place, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body responds to the entry of a foreign body into the system."
Is there a link between the levels of antibodies that develop and the side effects?
"There is no correlation between the sensations and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 50-60% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
People who developed strong reactions were not found to be more protected."
"In the medical literature, there is no correlation between immediate response and vaccination levels.
In some of the trials in which people were also given placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It's also a mental component-how the person perceives the vaccine, if they expect there to be side effects.
A lot of the phenomena that happen could also happen normally, but because the public has been vaccinated it attributes the response to the vaccine itself, and this is a bias that you see about vaccines in general - attribution of phenomena that happen next to the vaccine and are attributed to it."
According to Dr. Dvir, the causes of the common reported symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions differ.
"There are all sorts of theories about this, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One theory is that it's a strong immune response."
Is it even possible to assess the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, it was shown that those who did not sleep or who were more stressed were more vulnerable to infection.
Besides, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its ingredients.
When there's a decline in the immune system, you see it right away.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone is walking around with a weak immune system and not aware of it.
These are people who come to inquiries because of recurrent events of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, diet, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want too strong an immune system, because it can cause autoimmune diseases."
Soon, MRNA vaccines will appear in more contexts, thanks to the vast knowledge that has accumulated about them in recent times.
"There is no doubt that this will open the door to other vaccines of this kind.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines - for treating oncology diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the material stays very little time in the body-going in, doing its act, and then falling apart.
This technology is not new, but it has received a major boost due to the great need for a rapid vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week interval between dose and dose is too small, and some vaccine experts say that after a third dose we may not need another vaccine in the near term, so it's not clear whether we're going to get vaccinated every six months or if the third dose will give a bigger spread."
Thousands hurt: Severe privacy outage on Route 6
Route 6 customers?
Your personal information, including full name, addresses, payment amounts and full details of your trips, may have been compromised •
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, the Derech Eretz company violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
After a report by Derech Eretz, the operator of Route 6 in Israel, about a security incident that occurred at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement procedure.
As part of the incident, security weaknesses were discovered on its payments website, which allowed a lot of information from the accounts of the member's customers to be exposed for all to see.
Among other things, customers ' payment invoices were exposed over a short period of time and these invoices included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates and what hours.
In addition, because the company did not record as required by law the access to its systems, it is not possible to know accurately during what period unauthorized parties were able to access the company's systems.
In the breach letter, which the Privacy Protection Authority forwarded to the company, the Authority emphasized that most large companies and organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that as threats and risks develop, the organization must carefully examine the updated risks and act in accordance with the customary security measures in the circumstances, in accordance with the nature of the database and its nature.
As a result, companies and organizations have a duty to update their systems and conduct risk surveys and penetration tests, in order to assess and prepare for the changing risks.
In addition, companies and organizations are required to use an automatic documentation mechanism and to conduct training for employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Protection (Information Security) Regulations.
According to the inspection findings, the Authority determined that the company violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations, and required the Company to take a number of corrective actions.
Road Haaretz, operator of Route 6, said: "The issue has been dealt with in accordance with the strictest requirements."
Travel warning to Istanbul: Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to exchange a destination or date for their flight
The news for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: airlines will allow the flight dates to be changed.
Reminder: Earlier this week the Counter-terrorism Command raised the severity of the travel warning to level four for Istanbul.
This is the highest level and means " high threat level: Do not enter this country and in the event of a stay you must leave the country as soon as possible."
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus said they would allow Israelis who booked their flight before the travel warning, that is, before the date 13.6.22, to change their destination or flight date.
This is through an application to the airline.
Tourism Minister Razvazov said: "Israeli citizens should not have to pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
I am pleased that major airlines such as Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request and I hope that other companies will give a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey because of the severe travel warning."

The skies of Saudi Arabia are approaching: Israeli companies prepare to reinforce lines to the East
The summary of Expanded Flight Freedom over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of European destinations
Israel's largest airline is planning major changes ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we reported in Israel Hayom, Biden is expected to announce that he will authorize Al Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the UAE.
The emerging agreement means Al Al will be able to fly shorter routes to Far East destinations and Australia.
To do so, the airline will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, in order to free up planes for new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be cancelled starting this November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations that have quite a small Jewish population, but at this stage are less profitable for society.
In contrast, the new destinations examined by El Al are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
Here's how the move will play out: Dreamliners flying to Canada will be released in favor of long-haul flights to the East.
The Boeing 737s flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which EL AL operates flights using the Dreamliner aircraft.
So the company could release large planes to fly to other destinations in the East.
At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines could resume flying to Turkey, where the company could operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Exempted from isolation for the vaccinated and recovering from non-red states, the foreign tourists are returning.
Those arriving in Israel received notices from the Ministry of Health that they were exempt from the quarantine duty upon receiving a negative response to the coronavirus test •
It was only later that the ministry issued an official statement saying only that it was only passengers from orange countries, although those returning from red countries also reported receiving the message. •
In addition, tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
At the height of the epidemic - the end to isolation for returnees from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent notices to those returning to Israel this morning, according to which they are exempt from isolation upon receiving a negative response to the coronavirus test they performed after landing in Israel.
It's also about returning from red states.
Some of the messages sent informed returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative answer or after 24 hours at the latest, and some received the exemption after receiving the negative answer.
Only after that was an official announcement from the Ministry of Health stating that starting at midnight, 4.1.2022, vaccinated or recovering persons returning from Orange countries will undergo a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and will be quarantined for 24 hours or until they receive a negative result (the earliest).
The decision will be enshrined in the executive order of the Ministry of Health and will be submitted for approval by the Knesset Health Committee.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovering persons who have already returned to Israel from an Orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they performed at the entrance to Israel, will end the isolation at midnight tonight and are not obligated to perform a second test.
However, travelers from red states reported getting the message, too.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and returned from an Orange state will be placed in home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortened isolation upon receiving a negative result in a PCR test performed from the 7th day of landing in Israel (landing day is the first day).
The decision to lift most of the restrictions on travelers and especially those who are vaccinated comes a day before a High Court hearing brought by the Association of Travel Agencies, Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotel Association.
In a hearing to be held tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand that all other red states be removed from the list, with Professor Itamar Grotto backing them in his opinion.
Strangers can also enter.
The Prime Minister and the ministers of foreign Affairs, health, Interior, tourism and transport agreed that starting on Sunday 9.1.2022, vaccinated/recovering foreigners (according to the Ministry of Health definition) from Orange countries will be allowed entry - this is subject to filling out an online form in advance, carrying out a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, conducting a PCR test at the entrance to Israel and then entering isolation for 24 hours Hours or getting a negative answer on the test (the earliest).
Non-vaccinated/ non-recovering foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red states, except those whose entry has been approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The team outline will not be renewed at this time.
What about red states?
The Committee on the Classification of Countries in the Ministry of Health recommends to the government the Committee recommends removing from the red list of countries and moving to the orange list the countries: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that currently remain on the red list are the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option being explored by the Department of Health is to exempt vaccinated people returning from red states.
At the moment, it is unclear whether there is a connection between the messages received this morning by those returning to Israel and the guidelines that may be received by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
The Department of Health has yet to receive a response.
The sky is starting to open up: Health Ministry changes restrictions on gates
Vaccinators returning from orange states will be subject to 24-hour isolation •
The US, Turkey, UK and UAE countries will be red-flagged.
After long weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which to fly without restrictions, and after all returnees from abroad were charged with isolation, along with a ban on the entry of tourists to Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health decided to recommend eliminating the three-day quarantine requirement for Israelis returning from orange countries.
So far, anyone vaccinated - or recovering under the Health Ministry's definition who has returned from an Orange state-has been quarantined for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Currently, the isolation that the vaccinated and recovering persons returning from orange countries will have to enter is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of the coronavirus tests performed after landing at Ben Gurion Airport (the earliest) are received.
Those who are not vaccinated or recovering will nevertheless be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two coronavirus tests, or 14 days without the second test, whether they have returned from an orange or red country.
A vaccinated or recovering person returning from a red state must also be in full isolation.
The latest list of red countries recommended by the Health Ministry, which still needs to be approved by the government, includes the US, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the UK, Switzerland and the UAE.
In all countries, except Turkey, the average number of people entering the country in the past two weeks is more than 5% of the total, automatically putting them on the Red list.
The rate of increase among patients from Turkey is rapid, the rate of positive returns from it stands at just over 4%, so it was decided to put it on the red List as well.
The most prominent countries to be removed from the red list are France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Thus, from January 9, tourists who are vaccinated according to the requirements of the Ministry of Health will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, similar to the conditions of Israelis returning from an Orange state.
In this case, too, the decision is subject to approval by the government, which will discuss the matter in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few cases in which the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
Tourists are against the restrictions.
The Association of Travel Agencies, Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotel Association have filed a petition with the High Court to lift the travel restrictions.
The state lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but left eight significant states on the red List.
In a hearing to be held this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand that the state cancel the list of red states.
One person who will support the petitioners ' position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to attend the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razvazov, who in recent weeks has supported easing restrictions on the entry of foreign tourists to Israel, said yesterday: "The cancellation of the quarantine for those who return from abroad and the return of tourism to those who are vaccinated are the right and right thing at this time.
I thank my colleagues in government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the harm outweighed the benefit.
The vaccine is the best response to the epidemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to conduct a life - enabling routine alongside the coronavirus."
NIS 200 million investment: The new resort to be opened near Arad
The desert is booming: Another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years •
Chef's restaurants, private pools and 110 rooms are just a fraction of what the hotel will offer •
All details in the article
Fattal's 7MINDS and the White City Buildings real estate company have jointly acquired a plot covering 20 dunams in the Judean Desert, where they will build a luxurious resort at an investment of NIS 200 million. The hotel will be built on the same area as the Masada Hotel, which was demolished a year ago.
The resort will not open for another three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three shared pools, a spa, chef's restaurants, a recreation area, a gym and more.
The person who will be responsible for the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ran Shmueli of Claro Restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one who will build the menu that is expected to have a desert concept unique to the resort.
The mayor of Arad, Attorney Nissen Ben Hamo, welcomed the project:"The decision to build a new and prestigious hotel near Arad gives the official seal to the amazing progress Arad has made in the field of tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the choice of the developers and am convinced that it will be a joint success since Arad has enormous tourism potential."

Almost everyone these days has a tablet or an "old" smartphone lying in a disused cupboard.

It was more interesting to hear how many people received pensions in the Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the sought-after city centers) is worth, and how much the wages of the workers (minimum).
Israel Post must not be privatized
The question is how many packages came and how many were distributed?
Because how many of them
Packages are ordered, and they disappear at the sorting center in Modi'in...
There should be a 5P package tax so that they don't just order rubbish and load up on the post office
This is mainly indicative of the cost of living in the country.
Thank you to King Pakim for making it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to go near the post office and hope that no letters will come from them and the hatred of the post office has led us to give up everything that belongs to the possibility of mail.
Good week.
Lay off all postal workers, and start rebuilding the post office - by a private company.
Employers are patronising and some are racist!
On the phone they talk differently and when they get to the interview their true face is revealed.
No wonder they can't find workers.
They're looking for slaves.

And in a few months, a separation of powers was reported.
Some women can get up every morning with a new husband.
I wish he had participated in Eurovision.
Hopefully next year he'll be playing his own original song.
That's where the big break will come in.

Smells like oiled PR and is invited in under the guise of an all-in-a-yard article hiding behind the newspaper's editorial name.

The song is not to my taste and the music video is not to my liking.

Right, and besides, our medians are like most of them screwed up.
The home front command is playing "like" games, because at the time we don't know...
Why only in Tel Aviv?
Everyone else is right-handed.
Despite the nice talk - we have not heard of the arrest of the hackers, the prosecution of them.
And in the last four elections, was the electoral commission prepared for an attack?
Why not elaborate for example...
Some infiltration and disruption attempts have been made and some have managed to infiltrate the Electoral commission in the last 3 years.
Don't we deserve some data, facts and proportion?
One of the more bizarre signings of Hapoel Jerusalem.

Baldwin is a social threat in the dressing room, say players who played with him in both Greece and Spain.
Hollins was injured and did not play in the Red Star's last two games...

What's really with Brown?
If he does not sign, he may have a problem.
What about Lorenzo Brown?
Hahaha how fits like a glove next to a loser's......
A great player. The coach has to give him more minutes. Don't give him up.
No.
To bring in Adrian Banks.
We need more Israelis on the roster.
Those who really play
Much more suited than Wilbekin to the Maccabees.
You can see there are professionals at Maccabi Blatt and Katsch.
Perhaps individual ability still rankles with the Scot, but a team player, and especially a player's intelligence, is much higher.
It is so sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis warm the bench
By the way Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes rather than a collection of foreigners and therefore will not succeed with all the stars who have drawn from around the world
Who cares???
If you're already watching a game with 6 American players and 3 Israelis for decoration, isn't it better to watch a Golden State game????
Puzzle until League Ends
Good luck.
Good column.
Love it.
As for the Israelis, he's absolutely right!!
And a comment about Ziv - we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he cannot be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost confidence (and it is no wonder after the treatment he received after 2 bad games in the Euroleague, as if foreigners didn't have such games) and his use may also be wrong, and is a result of the fixations and stencils of the coach.
Non-shooting blazer with all due respect…
Yiftach Ziv should not be in Maccabi Tel Aviv He is destroying it too
There used to be no good acting but Sorkin and Blazer and Cohen today well done.
Ido Eshed is a bum fan from Holon who gave him 500 shekels so he writes nonsense.
Pictured no.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jack Cohen are much better than Coliero and Taylor, who in Europe play about twenty minutes and can't shoot a basket,who needs foreigners at a level of nothing and nothing, much better to play Israelis.
It's good to have a good spirit for everyone.
It depends on increasing internal consolidation...
And required disciplinary strengthening of a point guard and guard
And that's the management part.
No, I didn't.
The non-middle human interaction is important in many, many aspects.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is a bad thing both from a professional standpoint and, frankly, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the zoom camera and the problem is solved.
What happened, the researchers used zoom so their creativity wasn't enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years?
Someone missed an important detail.
Scientists don't care about warming or rainwater
They only care about population growth.
They're working on more and more vaccines and bastardized methods to destroy the world's population, so they're telling us foggy stories about warming and other nonsense they're making up.
There is no problem desalinating water, in unlimited quantities
They said that 50 years ago.
Meanwhile, there are more people.
The solution is to restrict birth, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the other leftists are anti - states, and in all religions that believe in gods-in the foolish, the ignorant, the foolish, the blind, or for short - in the herds
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living organisms (also seismans) consume oxygen and emit carbon dioxide.
The solution: Seismologists, commit suicide!
It's green.
Good for the world.
May you be better off, and safer for the planet and for all of us.
Who are the scientists and how did they do the research?
I don't believe any research that talks about climate warming because that thing doesn't exist.
It is a trend to control us and usurp our freedom and freedom.
It's all part of the new world order.
And reporters like Asaf Golan are on their side as he did during the Corona.
I've never heard him present facts on either side and he always brings the side that serves the globalists.
We're being watched.
Just burning money on academic" bullshit "research.
As usual, more bullshit from the land of psychopathic seismologists.
Things are getting better. Human knowledge is expanding and with it new technologies and improvements.
For centuries the world's population has been growing steadily at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, have launched a huge project of war in the Gobi desert, with astonishing success.
The Saudis are doing the same thing and are also succeeding (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It's actually the seismic "climate crisis" (carbon dioxide emissions, which are needed for plants) that's causing the Sahara to get greener, but hey, that doesn't fit the seismological agenda, so you won't read about it in the papers...
Leftists don't worry.
Their urine goes straight to their heads so they don't dry out.
Does proper management of reservoirs mean a cut of at least 70% of the world's population?
It's surprising that COVID comes along and it's surprising that most of the population is injected with an experimental substance whose 5-25-year impact on the injected is not at all known.
Is it any wonder that Agenda 2030 is getting under way and now this?
Really puzzling the whole thing!!!
Hahaha what bullshit.
Stories of a thousand and one nights, all scaremongering and of course nonsense of the left trying to control the world through media control, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years.
They said there was no more rain in the country either and the drought is constant and here there is rain.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalana and that Peres did not know that children of Yemenis were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not rob antiquities and helped Weizmann not mess with his soldiers.
It's clear that you're promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting bullshit.
They'll also take care of the hinges, handling the power outages and the power falls and we're on a roll.
"This is true Zionism" as the opening of the Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
In the wake of the crook Bennett, the rest of the blinkered politicians will line up in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I'm not anywhere near El Al, more like "shoe on."
Nice to meet you and no goodbye.
You won't see us in your dreams either.
One more big shame, we in Israel are being held captive by El Al.All direct flights in its hands are back prices. You better go bankrupt already ,it's time for truly open skies.4
Some are focusing on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia were to allow Al-Qaeda to fly over its territory, then it would not add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not such a big game changer.
It is better to focus on more interesting achievements like energy supply, acquisition of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the Emirates, tourism and allowing Israeli infrastructure companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
That's a lot more interesting than 30 planes a week that would save an hour each.
More important, they would allow Air Force squadrons to be positioned in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran, and would arrange for the Emirates of Bahrain, Oman, Egypt, and Morocco to drop arms on Iran nonstop for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another Air Force squadron will be based in northern Saudi Arabia and strike Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq to the east from a less crowded area.
Once we're done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait Djibouti and the Comoros Islands into a peace treaty with Israel and get a majority of Arab League nations to join the peace process.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdogan could also help Saudi Arabia overthrow the regime in Qatar and end the subversion of this country, and its support for the other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these common interests end, it will be possible to talk about a few more flights of El Al if Elal survives that long.
El Al should close.
Sell tickets for flights that don't take place.
The worst is that there is no way to get a representative
"There is no customer service."
Anyone who buys an EL Al ticket and wants to change or cancel will forget about it ,a loss is certain.
You've been warned.
Air Canada is better
They prefer to fly foreign.
Arkka has gone from company shit to corporate hell
El Al has also been downgraded.
Best call a cab.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you sued by train to the field
Ryanair's 40 euros is much cheaper than Wizz.
You can carry an 8kg backpack.
Why are you misleading?
Wizz Air on luggage and seat take a lot more!!!
One big doodle
For example, I have just come back if I am alive.
The permitted weight is 30 kg
Trulli 7kg
And each 1kg extra 3 30
Go find out
All companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices but in the end it's a bag the size of a school bag.
A trolley already costs money and a suitcase is very, very expensive.
It's a good thing the airlines don't ask us to come on a flight with underwear and a tank top so there's no weight on the plane.
At EL AL, the price is not cheaper, but 50% on booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, in a successful method.
A country eats its inhabitants and eats.
To this is to add genetic stinginess.
Shame on our country for letting foreign airlines fleece Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does what they want.
So what have you learned today that it's not enough to pay for an expensive ticket..
Prepare us all for a surprise..
You'll pay extras on the wheels of the plane, on the windows, on the luggage that doesn't arrive, on the food, on the drinks, and they'll probably add to the toilets.
In short, stay at home and prices will come down..
Or bigger.
Journey will take a few days
Throw up and you'll probably get there too.
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and hurt Israel, while still winning the support of his new fans.
Open now?
It's no accident.
Even when the chaos starts, it's just surreal what's happening here...
This is not the height of the epidemic
Simon, not for you.
Rising number of confirmed doesn't mean number of patients is rising
Stop being tested for any nonsense, sit at home if you don't feel well
End of Story
Government of Loons
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
Losing control.
Especially stupid.
Public Confusion Score 0
Only more harm than good
"The daily and cumulative number of deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave has increased, "he said.
The face and the pictures behind it."
Your ratings will soar.
You don't understand Finance Minister for not paying compensation to tourism workers
Bringing more contagion
They don't care about the people.
8,500 have died so far
Anything talk about it?
Burying us, especially the elderly
We have become Russia/North Korea.
If you don't talk about it, it doesn't exist!!
The main thing is that the citizens will put money into the state coffers to grow the ministers ' stomachs and buttocks!
Apparently Doberman and Abbas are the prime Minister!!
Very well, the Omicron suspension was relevant to the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half a people, and there is no point in trying to stop the Omicron - which exists here more than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange state, they are statistically less dangerous than someone who is already here.
This is the first time I have seen sensible steps by the Israeli government in the fight against Corona.
As if someone had actually sat down and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi - did what he thought would look better in the paper (and failed on all counts).
The Dream Government at its Best:
A finance minister who told tour guides to find a new profession two weeks ago to open the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education is tweeting at the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and setting her own policy , which puts all schools in complete chaos!
Foreign Minister, clown who turns up sick in Corona for cabinet meeting
And the most buffoonish prime minister we've had in the country , not in control of the situation and losing his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government with no leadership and no direction, in which the entire nation of Israel has lost faith.
Go home and the sooner the better!!!
Maybe it comes from a bad place, but from a loss of control.
Now house prices there will jump to 5 50 million per apartment.
So where are all the weathermen?
They are building a bus station and believe it will affect all homes.
Except for protection money after that.
The hotel will be a white elephant like its predecessor.
Looks amazing.
Good luck.
I feel like it.
What about the art of being photographed completely naked?
Giving up the trash
Serious Fight for Briar Field
Why don't they give benefits to girls in the Muslim Brotherhood-occupied Galilee
All for Klaxons
In the present reality, is the South still ours?!
Need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
My friends will be there too!!
How about a folk hotel for a folk person?
Well done for investing in the [booming]South
Arad is developing and thriving and kudos to the mayor, who since the beginning of his term has had an explosion for the good and the glory of the city of Arad
Cultural life, Society, Education and more
Just a great mayor who made the city better!
Well done
I wonder how much protection money the owner of the resort will pay.
Ready for protection money?
Wow, sounds good.
Those who can only afford El Al-a company with service and security , the best in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai????
Don't be a tin company.
Neither social nor economic.
In recent weeks she has cancelled return flights from abroad, sent messages to Israelis telling them the flight was cancelled, ruined the entire trip on the spot, informed passengers to leave a message on W.App and Messenger come back after two or even three days.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, is it better to ground planes on the ground, rather than make the flights back to the country, and avoid economic damage?
Are there any other suckers flying in?
Neither did free fly with them.
Have they returned the millions of customers they took captive yet?
easyJet to Geneva round-trip 70 euros.
El Al One Direction 5 560.
I don't buy even for דולר 10, cheaters nonstop...
Then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their realization will be supplemented by the price change.
Those who buy tickets put their money on the wing of the plane.
Tin company.
Low Coast Exercises.
No luggage, no seat choice, certainly no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all members of the"disgusting."..Ali!
Nature dilutes fools!!
