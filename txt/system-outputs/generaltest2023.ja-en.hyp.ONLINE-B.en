All had previously been vaccinated against rabies.
He urges people to get their pets vaccinated against rabies and avoid touching the saliva of suspected animals.
Rabies can be transmitted to humans not only from dogs, but also from cats and bats.
Nearly 100% of people who become infected with the virus die, but vaccination before the onset of symptoms can prevent death.

FUJI System development to prevent accidents left behind Experiment with own vehicle | Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic information on Aichi, Gifu, Mie and Shizuoka
Fuji (headquartered in Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent children from being left behind in cars.
A motion sensor is installed in the car, and when a person's movement is detected, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with a pick-up vehicle at our facility.
Protecting the safety of children in the midst of tragic accidents caused by being left behind.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with two pick-up vehicles of "teracoya THANK", an English conversation after school for children that we run in Chiryu city.
Human sensors are installed in three places on the ceiling of the car to detect the movement of people based on the temperature difference between them and their surroundings.
With the vehicle engine turned off and the door closed, if a person's movement is detected after a certain amount of time has passed, a warning notification will be sent automatically.
By linking information with engine and door status, false positives are prevented as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to making a call to a pre-registered number, it will also be displayed in the chat on your computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and consideration is given to prevent mistakes such as overlooking.
The demonstration experiment will continue until around the end of February.
Ikko Kamiya, manager of the second section of the Innovation Promotion Department, pointed out, "During the experiment, peripheral issues other than the system became apparent."
For example, it was possible to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"If we can expand our solutions," he puts his strength into it.
The impetus for the development of the system to prevent people being left behind was a series of accidents involving shuttle buses that were left behind across the country.
An employee with a young child suggested something that could be done to protect the safety of the child.
We decided to develop it by making use of the know-how such as information management using IoT (Internet of Things) and sensors cultivated through FA (factory automation) related business.
Fuji's abandoned-abandonment prevention system sells for its simplicity.
The sensor can be installed by simply pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to pick-up vehicles, it aims to lower the hurdles for introduction and popularize it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization while seeking cooperation from nursery schools and kindergartens.
[Editorial] The start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen between Tsuruga and Shin-Osaka, which was originally scheduled for 2023, has been postponed, and this is beginning to affect town planning west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture.
In Obama City, where the new station will be built, the detailed location of the station has not yet been announced, and city planning, including the development of the surrounding area, is at a standstill.
It is expected that the formulation of the plan will take a long time, and it should be announced as soon as possible.
The planned Hokuriku Shinkansen station in Obama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency indicated roughly the location of stations within a radius of about 2.5 kilometers from JR Higashi-Obama Station.
We were aiming for the winter of 2010 to finalize the detailed station locations and routes.
In 2021, Obama City will start full-scale Shinkansen-related business in anticipation of the opening of Tsuruga and the opening of Obama in the future.
In the initial budget for fiscal 2010, the number of projects will be further increased, and we are trying to promote community development in anticipation of the announcement of the location of the new station.
However, the exact location of the new station is still unknown.
The city is considering land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station, and has set a budget of 3 million yen for this fiscal year as a project to formulate a basic plan, but it is expected that it will not be implemented.
An urban plan centering on the new station "will take time to build a consensus among citizens," said a city official.
There is a case in Echizen City of a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to put together an overall concept.
It is feared that the longer the announcement is made, the shorter the preparation period for the opening of the facility will affect the development of the surrounding area.
Before the location of the new station, there is a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, a citizen's group in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism demanding that the extension plan be withdrawn.
In the political circles of Ishikawa Prefecture, the start of construction was postponed, and there were calls for reconsideration of the Maibara route. there is
Obama citizens are relatively calm about the postponement of the start of construction, but there are concerns that the location of the new station and the timing of its opening remain unclear will affect future momentum.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue his activities to request the government to open the entire line as soon as possible, but the voices of the areas along the railway line calling for construction to start as soon as possible will be essential.
Indifference to the idea that ``Shinkansen trains will eventually pass (to the west of Tsuruga),'' won't sway the national government and neighboring prefectures and local governments.
I want the enthusiasm to keep raising my voice.
Chocolate shop for Valentine's Day, where sampling was revived for the first time in three years = Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture on February 9

A cat-shaped catering robot introduced at the Rock Salt Jingisukan Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae branch.
The cute facial expressions are popular with family customers. = Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
The food service industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, is moving to introduce robots that deliver food to customers.
It is said that it is useful for labor saving in store management and "contactless" customer service to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, and that the cute facial expressions of the robot are popular with family customers.
Restaurant owners and related parties are saying, ``It is difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, so the robots serving food will become even more popular.''
"Gin, gin, Genghis Khan♪"
A robot with a cat's face displayed on the screen smoothly moves around the store with dishes placed on it while playing light music.
When you arrive at the customer's table, talk to the customer such as "I brought the dish you ordered."
In August 2022, a cat-shaped catering robot was introduced at Rock Salt Jingisukan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Branch in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City.
When the food ordered by the customer is placed on the robot waiting near the kitchen and the table number on the screen is pressed, the robot autonomously travels to the table and delivers it.
It has a built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice function, etc., and reacts when the customer touches it, and the cat's face on the screen is rich.
The Bonta Group, which manages this store, has introduced a serving robot at two stores including this store.
President Toshiyuki Saito said, "The biggest reason for the introduction is labor shortage," emphasizing that it is part of productivity improvement through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually about 30%, but the introduction has reduced it to 21-22%.
The robot also has the role of collecting plates that customers have finished eating, leading to more efficient cleanup.
In August 2010, the Rokken Hoshiyama Fukui Branch, a yakiniku (grilled meat) and offal hotpot restaurant in Araki Shimbocho, Fukui City, introduced a serving robot.
Eifuku Hoshiyama, president of Seongsan Shoten, which runs the company, said, "Even if we recruit full-time employees and part-time workers, they don't come.
At the Fukui store, we operate by separating the zone where employees serve food and the delivery range of the robot.
The cost of leasing the robot is said to be about the same as the wages of a part-time worker.
In order to save labor, in addition to using robots, the store has introduced an ordering system using tablet terminals, and is also considering self-checkout.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the job openings-to-applicants ratio by job type in December 2010 was 6.94 for "customer service" at restaurants and other establishments, indicating a high sense of labor shortage.
A person in charge of Net System (2-chome, Takagi-chuo, Fukui City), which is a sales agent for serving robots, said, "The labor shortage at restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious, partly due to the impact of the corona crisis, and there are many inquiries about introducing robots." talk.
President Hoshiyama said, ``It will become more difficult to secure employees for suburban stores in the future, and I think that serving robots will become more popular.''
[Editorial] The town of Echizen makes an ending note and distributes it to the townspeople who want it.
The year before last, he published a "Okuyami Handbook," which covers the necessary procedures when a relative dies, a written-in inheritance list, and a family tree.
In various parts of the prefecture, lectures on how to write ending notes and organize your life are often held.
Echizen-cho's ending note is 35 pages.
Beginning with a review of his personal history in five chapters, he writes about his current health condition and financial situation, nursing care in the future, hopes for end-of-life medical care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a column where you can write what you want to do for the rest of your life or a message to someone important to you.
35 pages seems like a pain to write, but you don't have to fill in all the pages.
What do you most want to write down for your family and those around you?
The key is to have a clear purpose.
Bookstores sell a variety of notebooks for different purposes, and it is said that you can start writing casually from where you can write.
It was in 2009 that the word shukatsu was coined after job hunting.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake struck.
Many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly", and it is said that more and more people are preparing for their own end and end of life.
It's been more than 10 years since then.
The new corona disaster that has hit the world is still not over.
Prices have soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other factors, and electricity bills this winter have jumped to unimaginable prices.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current high prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, siblings and relatives could share the costs of funerals, nursing care, and managing graves, but now it is not uncommon for an only child to be an only child.
In addition, although life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a decade ago, the dilemma is that the older you get, the higher the risk of dementia and the need for long-term care.
It is important to keep in mind that behind the fact that shukatsu is not a temporary end and has become established, there is also a rise in social unrest.
In any case, everyone wants to avoid putting an undue burden on their partner and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword for ending notes, but you shouldn't be too complacent.
Rather than writing down my hopes and requests secretly, I would like to discuss them with my family at least once and calmly prepare for that time.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (second from right) and Minister of Education Keiko Nagaoka (third from right) pose for a commemorative photo with officials at the elementary school they visited.
On February 10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture, indicated that in principle it was not necessary for students and teachers to wear masks at the graduation ceremony.
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology established a policy that children should not wear masks at graduation ceremonies.
A junior high school principal at a large school said, "It's actually difficult to keep a wide distance between students, and I'm worried about how to respond. Some students feel uneasy about removing their masks."
It is said that the topic has been raised among teachers after reports surrounding the wearing of masks at graduation ceremonies.
On the other hand, one elementary school principal said, "If the government decides, they will not wear them. If choral singing is excluded, it may be possible to respond realistically."
At the graduation ceremony this time, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to relax the measures, such as allowing the participation of the students who had refrained from participating and resuming the chorus of the graduates.
In the prefecture, prefectural high schools plan to hold ceremonies in early March, while public elementary and junior high schools plan ceremonies in the middle of the same month.
Prefectural boards of education and municipal boards of education are expected to wait for an official notification from the education ministry before making a decision.
There were also some cautious voices about the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's policy of not requiring students to wear masks in all school educational activities from this spring's new semester.
The principal of the elementary school said, "Suddenly, one day, children will be confused if they don't wear masks. It's only natural that the number of children who decide to wear masks first and then gradually remove them is increasing."

On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided not to ask students to wear masks in school education activities from April, in accordance with the government's new guidelines for wearing masks.
As a general rule, no masks will be worn during choirs, physical education classes, and club activities.
During the 2022 academic year, we will ask for infection control measures according to the current hygiene management manual, and we will inform the boards of education and schools about precautions to be taken after April.
Graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high, and high schools, as well as universities, will be held in 2022. In principle, measures such as ventilation will be implemented, and graduates, faculty and staff members, and participating students will not wear masks.

A self-published book by the NPO "Emotional Collection and Editorial Bureau" "Dear Prime Minister 'Breakwater of Life' From Tojinbo"
"Dear Prime Minister 'Breakwater of Life' From Tojinbo" I self-published my 10th book with this title.
Newspapers across the country have picked up the story, and many readers have sent us their impressions.
The purpose of publishing this book is to create a "comfortable society" by sharing with you what we have heard directly from those who attempt suicide, regarding "social and structural" environmental issues regarding the causes of suicide in Japan. I wanted to have it.
For 18 years and 10 months, we have been patrolling the rocky shores of Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a famous suicide spot, to prevent suicide, and we have been providing support until those who attempt suicide are found, protected, and restarted. continues.
This book is a compilation of the problems we have heard from 784 people (as of February 6) who have been taken into custody so far. I am suing for 7 items.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are “life-saving” activities.
(2) "Human rights violations" pile up behind the suicide.
(3) Suicide victims are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens who live outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) Even if a person with mental disorders such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, it is treated as an "accident."
(6) The “duty of safety consideration” in high-risk areas for suicide has been forgotten and commercialism is running.
(7) The portion of the doctrine of a new religious group that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of telling the other party about future curses and threatening them with money and goods is extortion.
Religious groups that are committing criminal acts of "fraud and extortion" should be announced and eliminated.
Therefore, I received comments from those who subscribed to this book, such as "I was moved by the strong mentality of those who are working on this activity" and "This former police officer is a model among police officers". ``You are a living bodhisattva who supports other people like your own relatives,'' etc. Introducing the ed.
When I saw the photos in the newspaper article, tears welled up in my eyes.
I have heard that the number of suicides among people who have been cornered by the corona misfortune is increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone is like that person.
I would like to see a society where people can live happily with the life they have been given.
I felt respect and gratitude to all the staff who devoted their hearts to those who were suffering to the point of wanting to die.
I think that this activity is an activity that overuses both body and mind, but please take care of yourself and continue to speak to me.
thank you.

Kenji Shimada, who takes pictures of capybaras almost every week and posts them on social media, on February 1 at Hapijan, an indoor facility at Asuwayama Park Amusement Park, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture.
There is a man in the city who takes pictures of capybaras every week at the indoor facility "Hapijan" in Asuwayama Park Amusement Park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, and posts them on Instagram.
The post is lined with a variety of thumbnail images, such as the moment of yawning with teeth peeking out from a large mouth, or lying down and basking in the sun.
He has more than 10,000 followers in Japan and overseas, and has played a role in spreading the charm of Hapijan and Capybara to many people.
⇒ Shizuka Kudo posted traditional vegetables from Fukui Prefecture on Instagram
The man is Kenji Shimada (38), a company employee who lives in the city.
From March 2021, we started transmitting on the exchange site (SNS).
The capybara is one of the world's largest rodents, and has webs between its fingers that make it a good swimmer.
Since its opening in 2018, Hapijan has raised three animals, one male and two females, and you can observe them up close and feed them.
Mr. Shimada first learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
When he saw a video of him relaxing in a hot spring, he said, "What is this animal?"
I was fascinated by his human-like facial expressions and gestures.
After hearing that it will be bred in Hapijan, I was looking forward to being able to see it nearby.
I started taking pictures in earnest about three years ago when I bought a single-lens reflex camera.
I use it to capture the adorable appearance of capybaras, and I never miss a photo opportunity, such as the way they shake their bodies and cut water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram has reached about 830, and it is enough to look back and say, "I took so many pictures."
It seems that the male Yamato-kun, who seems to have remembered Mr. Shimada while visiting frequently, comes closer and calls out "Kyuru-kyuru".
"It's cute and I'm happy," Shimada's love for capybaras continues to grow.
Through SNS, he enjoys interacting with capybara lovers nationwide, such as showing each other his best shots every month.
Mr. Shimada, who says he often visits zoos in neighboring prefectures to see capybaras, said with a smile, "I want to continue shooting and disseminating my home, Mt. Asuwa."

Hayachine, known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, will be held until the 12th. It is held at the city general cultural property center in Osako-cho.
We have collected 124 materials, including valuable specimens collected by our predecessors, and introduce the footprints of our predecessors who were involved in the botanical research of Mt. Hayachine.
Hayachine's botanical research was carried out by Karl Johann Maximovich (1827-1891), a Russian botanist who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Chonosuke Sugawa (1827-1891), who was from Shiwa Town and collected plants under the guidance of Maximovich. 1842-1925).
As a foreigner, Maximovich was not allowed to roam freely in Japan, so he asked Sugawa to collect them, and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa continued to support Maximovich's research after returning to Japan, leading to the publication of ``Himekozakura'', ``Nanbutou Uchiso'' and ``Miyama Yamabukishouma'', which are unique to Mt. Hayachine.
After that, modern botanical taxonomist Tomitaro Makino (1862-1957) published ``Nanbutoranoo'', ``Clover clover'', ``Nanbu dog thaliana'' and ``Nanbu dog thaliana'' in 1903 (Meiji 36) based on collections by local researchers. In 1938, he climbed Mt. Hayachine and discovered and named ``Kato Chickweed''.
From the materials on display, we can see that many researchers have clarified valuable alpine plants.
Matsunosuke Sugimura (1874-1948), who was the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School and was a botanical researcher who accompanied the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 1927 (Showa 2), worked as a curator at the Osako Municipal Mountain Museum. Shichirō Tamagawa (1914-1988), who was also involved in the publication of The Plants of the Plants, is also introduced.
Sohei Yoshida, a curator at the center, said, "In the background of the name of each plant on Mt. Hayachine, there is a lot of research and connections between people. We will trace the connections between researchers spreading from rural areas to the whole country. I can,” he says.
The exhibition consists of 4 chapters, Chapter 1 is about the beliefs and history of Hayachine, and Chapter 2 is based on research by Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundations of geology in Japan. It also highlights the geological features of Mt. Hayachine.

In contrast to normal real estate procedures, Sakasama Real Estate discloses the information of the person who wants to rent, contacts the lender, and if an agreement is reached, each person signs a contract.
Operated by On-Co Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture), the service began in June 2020 as a demonstration experiment that is responsible for discovering latent vacant houses and building relationships through vacant houses.
The establishment of a branch office is the seventh and the first in Kyushu.
This is the first time in Japan on a remote island.
The event was attended by about 20 people, including On-Co and Tsuginova staff, Wadomari and China town hall employees, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background to the establishment of the branch office, saying, ``While the movement to attract people from outside the island is becoming active, if we can make use of vacant houses and vacant stores, the town and the island will be more lively.'' .
"We want to connect with people who have properties on the island and people who want to do something, and we want to help move forward with as many projects as possible," he said.
Takeshi Mizutani, representative of On-Co, said, "We take care of each vacant house, and discuss what the locals want to do with the area, what kind of people they want to visit, and what criteria they should use. It is necessary," he said, pointing out points to note in terms of management.
"The deeper the connections between people, the more information we can collect," he said, calling on the islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

If the battery is normal, when the key is turned on, the ACC, that is, the accessories, will be energized, so the blinker and brake lights will turn on.
It will also become a horn.
However, since the voltage rises after the engine is started, it will be fine.
Can ADATA DDR4 and Samsung DDR4 be mixed?

In principle, if the pin arrangement, voltage, frequency, and other standards are the same, they can be used together.

It is a "split" of the hair due to the hairstyle.
If you continue to style your hair like this, if you use the wrong comb or brush, your hair will likely become thin, so be careful.

If you don't like your skin showing, you can solve the problem by changing your hair style so that it doesn't split.

I think it depends on the cause of the swelling.
If you have an infectious disease such as a cold, I think you will catch it when the cold is cured to some extent.

When will the amount I applied for in the final tax return at the beginning of the year be transferred to my account?
I think it will be transferred in about 2-3 weeks.
You will receive a postcard telling you that the money will be transferred to you by postcard.
I have no choice but to wait for the postcard (notice) for the time being.

Prepaid cards cannot be used.
It's been a long time, but do you think it's okay?
Vegetable juice.
Depends on how it is stored.
If it's been refrigerated for a long time, you can still drink it after a few days, but if it's been left outside or at room temperature, it's better to throw it away.
If something happens to your body later on, it's a big deal.

About Instagram.
I (general person) currently have about 10,000 followers.
Or do you think otherwise?
What does it feel like?
I think it's amazing.
It is a miracle for ordinary people.
I think you were doing something special.
Problematic and frustrated
I don't have much time to exercise, so I decided to rely on the trendy pressurized innerwear and bought it.
My body is H175m W80kg I bought L size.
It's quite difficult to put on at first, but once you get used to it, you'll be fine.
I used it for a few days, but now I'm using another compression inner because of a problem.
The problem is 1. If the arm circumference is not quite slim, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve (just the upper arm) is too tight, and it becomes a little congested and itchy.
2. The lower abdomen is loose I stopped using it because of the above two problems.
It's pretty tight in terms of comfort, but there's no problem sleeping with it on.
Great for those who like it
Even at 158cm and 50kg, S was fine.
But it didn't suit me, who has a large frame and is muscular.
It's not a three-dimensional structure such as the buttocks, so it's easy to create strange gaps and fall down.
I always felt like I had to pull it up.
I think it's good if you have a body like a stick.
In terms of thickness, would you say that it is a safe thinness?
It wasn't henna or it looked like it was going to break, but I was able to tuck in my knee-high boots and feel refreshed.
wonderful
I didn't want to show my upper body too much skin, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit and came across this.
The top is fashionable with a lace-up back and a one-point mark on the hem.
I'm glad that I can choose from two ways, either wearing a bikini underneath or wearing shorts over it (^.
^^ It just arrived, and I've only tried it on, so I haven't soaked it in the water yet, so I don't know how it will hold up when it gets wet, but the stitching is beautiful, and the fabric is solid, so it's worth the price. I thought it was a bargain.
I was told that there is no wire in the bust area, but when I touched it, it seems that there is a proper hard core at the bottom of the pad.
However, it doesn't hurt when I wear it, and it fits my bust properly, so I think it looks good when I move.
Did you make a model change from without pads to with pads?
(^.
^^ I'm looking forward to getting into the water from now on ♪ Thank you ♪
45kg156cm M size is a little big.
The raincoat is made of thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but the manufacturing method is solid, so I think it can be used for a long time.
It comes with two rain visors to keep your face from getting wet.
There was no problem with strength, and I was able to use it safely even on a bicycle in a storm.
It didn't even break after use.
I put it in a compression bag and carry it in a compact state.
It really exceeded my expectations at this price.
I was able to put it on safely.
I installed it on the CLA 180 shooting brake in 2016.
Even an amateur can install it by reading the YOU tube and instructions.
If you loosen the torx screw too much, the screw will drop inside the car.
I dropped one and got lost.
Also, when crimping the gray connector between the brown and red and green wires, if you use a tapered type such as radio pliers, you will not be able to apply force evenly and the plastic will crack as shown in the photo, making it impossible to attach.
When I called support, they mailed me a new cable the next day and they are very supportive.
At the time of re-challenge, I used wide pliers as shown in the picture of the instruction manual and crimped it all at once, and it went well.
When I put the last main unit back into the car, it was a bit tricky to store the wiring, but I managed to install it.
After installing it, I can watch DVD, TV, and navigation while driving without any problems.
It costs over 80,000 yen at a dealer, and over 40,000 yen at a specialty store, so I think it's a very cost-effective product.
below price
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated. I tried using it, but I think that if you don't try a product that integrates the head and the body pillow, it may or may not suit you. I thought it wouldn't be a mistake if the body pillow was separate.This time I bought it for 3600 yen at the time sale, but I want to return it.
It's neither good nor bad
Product arrived.
I was able to use it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use and you can milk properly.
However, there are times when I feel that the sound is a little noisy and the response of the power button is poor.
I can use it without problems, so I don't mind it, but people who care about it may be bothered.
It's not super quiet 😅 I might be a little careful if I use it at night.
Also, I was worried that the attached tube and the part that connects to the machine would fit in the tube, but I pushed it in. It's lightweight, so I think it's easy to carry!
I need a trick to make foam...
I'm not sure if it's the worst compatibility with my hair type or if it's a performance problem of this shampoo, but it doesn't lather at all in normal use.
(The shampoo I've used so far was foaming without any problems even if I used it normally.) So, here's the solution I found ↓ ① First, take a little less shampoo than usual and spread it all over your hair. Shawasha familiarize yourself.
(At this point, no bubbles appear) ② Rinse your hair once, then take an appropriate amount of shampoo and apply it to your hair.
(It finally lathers normally) Well, in short, it's washed twice lol The amount of shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to use as little shampoo as possible the first time... is.
It's obvious that I bought such an expensive shampoo, but I could definitely feel that my hair felt better.
However, it is an honest impression that I was not satisfied with the overall review.
It's a pity that the Quattro Botanico series was taken care of by the face wash goods...
Even though the capacity is small, the cost performance is bad because you are forced to wash it twice.
In addition, considering the scent that seems to be unpopular with everyone, I will give it a slightly stricter 2 stars.
difficult to evaluate
There are negatives and positives, and evaluation is difficult.
Just use the blade cleaner to clean the front side of the blade.
I think that it is a good match with a razor with a good precision blade.
Positive: Removes dirt on the blade, such as sebum and soap scum, as intended.
(Only on the front side) If the dirt makes it dull, it will last longer.
Negative: The life of the smoother is drastically reduced.
The coating on the cutting edge such as titanium coat, ceramic coat, etc. will peel off easily.
(If you use shaving 2-3 times, most of the coating will come off, so I think it's better to use this cleaner after that.
Be careful with razors that say do not wipe the cutting edge.
) I hear that it can be substituted with fall-prevention rubber (anti-vibration rubber) that can be put under furniture used as a preparation for earthquakes, so I'm wondering about cost performance.
*The life of my razor is increased by 20-30%.
It's difficult to judge when a razor blade is discarded, but I think it's when the blade is damaged by shaving and the edge of the blade becomes rickety.
In that sense, I think it's a good product because it can prevent the sharpness from going down due to dirt.
(It's just a cleaner and has no sharpening effect. Sometimes it feels like it's being sharpened, but that's probably because the small rust has been removed.)
Inspired by TV commercials...
I bought it after seeing a commercial on a TV commercial showing how the face of an older woman looks better with just one application.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little firmer than a normal gel, and I wiped it off with a pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it feels sticky and unpleasant, but as you apply it while massaging it, it gets into your skin unexpectedly.
There was almost no stickiness after entering, and my skin felt like it was sticking to my hands.
The lift up didn't go like TV.
I felt a sense of firmness at once.
I have super dry skin, so this alone is not enough, so I've been using Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It feels really moisturizing.
I had high hopes that it would cover loose pores, but it did not.
Try using one bottle and see if it works.
It must have been difficult to put together...
It's an exhaustive compilation of statements made by politicians over the past few years.
While reading, I somehow agree that that remark at that time was after all.
However, it's hard to say whether "fact-checking", as the authors call it, is sufficient when considering its value as reading material.
To be honest, it's not interesting to read.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the major flaw in this book was the "method".
Ultimately no one knows whether what we call "facts" will always be facts.
Judging from the way it was written, I felt that the authors were aware of the fragility of "fact-checking" (or should I say falsifiable).
It makes me feel a little gloomy when it comes to the current Japanese journalists' perception of "facts" at this level.
Many people seem to recommend it, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge about the contents of this book.
If there are readers like the reviewer who are interested in the "fact checks" conducted by the Japanese mass media today, I think this book will suit them.
For those who do not improve their scores in mock exams.
At my school, political economy was printed out, and the class format was so boring that I felt like I was learning while I was doing it.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
Currently in high 3 and center this year.
Since I purchased it in March, I chose this as my study partner for an hour on the way to and from school.
First impressions can be summed up in one simple word.
You've reached God's realm.
When I finished one lap and took past questions, my average score was 40 at the time and I was 70.
I was surprised even myself.
It grows as if you ate something strange.
This reference book not only provides me with knowledge and information about politics and economics, but I also felt that my own strength and motivation for studying have increased synergistically.
Thank you for letting me meet you.
crime prevention
Eight years ago, I experienced two attempts at door picking, and I have taken anti-crime measures.
It is replacement by purchase from Cameras which we purchased this time eight years ago.
I used to use an infrared irradiation 30m type (other company).
This product was written by another person, but the distance at which faces can be recognized at night is about 5m.
I agree.
It just arrived and I haven't set it up yet, but I'm at the stage of comparing the image quality of the camera and checking for defects.
The image quality is much better than the camera eight years ago (of course).
I used a 32-inch monitor to divide the image into 4 parts, but if you maximize the shooting size, there is no problem.
So far, there are no problems with the product.
For those who are considering the level of face recognition other than crime prevention, they may be dissatisfied with the night shooting, but at this price, it is the best!
I'm for security measures, but I don't require face recognition.
Because if you are masked or masked, you won't know (especially at night).
Professional burglars (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
Even if it is small, it seems that high-performance cameras and recording can be distinguished.
On the other hand, I'm in trouble if I'm not a professional.
Nonetheless, recent burglaries are bold and clever, so we recommend using a variety of crime prevention products instead of relying solely on cameras.
For example, there are white solar LED garden lights available at home centers for about 1,500 yen (the latest ones are very bright with 6 units).
It's solar, so you don't need electricity, but it doesn't turn on until morning in winter, so we have three 100V motion LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30m at which people can be recognized.
Also, for daytime crime prevention, if you feel that the small size of the camera makes it less intimidating, you may need a cover.
I have a 24-hour security camera in operation sticker.
This is an original product from the security camera manufacturer that I used before.
Manufacturer products are more effective than pasting the ones sold at home centers.
The place to put it is a thief's entrance that can not be covered by camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
At the same time, it was a minus because the instruction manual for net settings was difficult to understand.
If there are any deficiencies after installation and setting, I will add them.
I sympathize so much that it hurts to read
If you were born in 1982 in Japan, the social situation may be a little better than her, but the situation is still far from equal, even with the enactment of the Equal Employment Law.
As I read on, the painful memories of surviving as a member of society in the midst of discrimination, such as "Oh, that's true", came back to me, and it made me feel suffocated.
It depicts the suffering of all women who try to live as human beings, not as women, not only in Korea and Japan, but also in feudal societies.
Isn't it time for women to put an end to emotional confrontations and stand shoulder-to-shoulder in this society?
A drama that makes you think "Men are the worst"
The story of the main character who was sexually abused by his biological father as a child.
Of course, even after becoming an adult, the wounds continue to drag on.
All the guys that come out are the worst.
The main character's husband, who is mild-mannered and seems to care about his family, is also the lowest in a sense.
There are spoilers ↓ Even if you know that the main character's sister is being domesticated by her husband, she ignores it. A development that makes men irritated, such as putting it away.
The protagonist's old mother, who pretends to be stupid, knows that her husband (the protagonist's biological father) was killed by her daughter, but her daughter doesn't know that overdose).
In short, after the death of the rape father, it seems that he didn't let his daughter receive counseling, so it's only natural that the main character would go crazy.
The main character's daughter wants to ask about her deceased grandfather?
Are you worried about the old man who died so young at this age?
in a drama? too many.
A few years ago, France was hit by a summer heat wave. It was reported to be full.
These people are "dry".
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that it was "dry".
French films are completely different from American films, and many of them have vague parts that leave a good aftertaste.
professional boundaries
If a precise calculation and an unforeseen accident that could not be fully read were to affect someone's life, then even if they had calculated to some extent from the beginning, they must have decided that it would be worth risking their own life.
The script, which embodies such a subtle heart-waving drama about how far she deceives those around her in order to fight her own conflicts that she can't show in public, and to get her own beliefs through, was brilliant.
On top of that...Jessica's acting is really great.
No matter what you look at, you can't go wrong.
It's really a professional job.
Usability After that, it broke down
I've used three so far, but this product broke in no time, in both good and bad ways.
The reason I chose this product was that I used the first 2200mA built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out after 3 sessions of 200 degrees for 5 minutes.
The second USB port is defective.
Charging is not possible.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but when I reinserted the battery about 15 times (I used the battery with a charger so that the USB terminal would not break), the contact was bad. For some reason, it became difficult to turn on the power.
Press the lid to turn on the power.
If you are an ICOS user, I think there are people who have experience.
That symptom.
Although it is also in the notes, batteries other than the attached batteries are not used.
The claws and catches seem to be machined, so there doesn't seem to be any bends.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought the one without the Starley logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the comparison with this one.
It looks the same size.
The same goes for chambers and draws.
Liquid crystal This is more beautiful.
It might be newer than without the logo.
Vibe This is modest.
Like a smartphone vibe.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibe or the sound is huge.
A cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is also made in China.
Attachments are slightly different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
No logo is a lump like steel wool.
Roughly like that.
Starley would have been better, but if it broke quickly it would lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I had no choice but to return it, so it was troublesome, but I proceeded with the procedure.
Just an ear rubber, but an ear rubber
This flat rubber is really painless.
It's the best similar mask I've ever used in terms of how comfortable it feels on my ears.
Even flat rubber can be twisted, and the twisted hem rubs against the base of the ear, which can be more painful than round rubber, but this product is not only soft to the touch, but the length is just right to prevent twisting. I think it is possible.
The three-dimensional fit on the face is good, and not only does it fit well, but there is a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower part of the chin, which is in front of the mouth, so you won't feel stuffy.
It may be because it fits the size of your face.
I don't know if it will fit everyone in the same way, but I think it's a good idea to try it once if you don't like the other smaller sizes.
When you open the outer box, it is in vinyl with a central slit like a box tissue, but when you take out the first one, the ear rubbers on both sides get caught and it is difficult to take out, so I deducted one star for that. rice field.
The vendor's response is 1 star
The price and taste are perfect, but I was distrustful of the company's response of ignoring and sending it even though the date was specified.
In addition to this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
I always buy from Amazon, so I know the delivery person.
I tried to match the arrival date as much as possible because they would carry especially heavy items upstairs, but it didn't work out.
It is said that shipping companies are having a hard time because of Amazon, but I am thinking that there is at least one thing that users can cooperate with.
I am disappointed in the response of the arrogant trader.
But the price is cheap.
If you are considering buying it, it includes disposal costs.
There are many complaints and I don't think it can be used for a long time.
I think it's a good idea to consider including the cost of disposal.
For reference, some local governments have centers that accept oversized garbage for free or at a low cost if you bring it in.
[Sitting comfort] The seat surface is slightly tilted to the left and is wobbly, so sitting is very tiring.
Even the slightest movement makes a loud creaking noise.
It is too noisy to use at night.
This is my biggest problem, and I feel that I can't continue to use it.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions are only rough pictures.
The information necessary for assembly is lacking, and there are many typographical errors.
・There is no explanation about the orientation when installing the seat surface and the support fixing base.
When installed correctly, the lever for adjusting the height is on the right hand side facing backward, and the dial for adjusting the direction of the spring on the back is facing forward.
However, since it is more natural for the height adjustment lever to face forward, many people will install it by mistake.
There are no such basic precautions in the instruction manual, so you will have to assemble by trial and error while looking at rough pictures.
・There is an error in the description of the contents The contents list at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who cannot find the 12 8x20mm screws that are included and look for them.
The 8x20mm screws are already inserted into the chair, so be careful not to waste your time looking for them.
The work accuracy is low, and it seems that there are combinations that can be inserted even with the same screw holes and screws, and combinations that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, just inserting the screw into the screw hole is very difficult.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with the screws inserted like this.
Also, I couldn't find the spare screw in the manual.
[Others] The black surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring and is whitish in places, so don't expect a beautiful product like the product photo.
An explanation that the manual is incomplete and a supplementary explanation of the above installation method was sent to the email address registered with Amazon 2-3 days after the product arrived.
Originally, such items should be sent out immediately after shipment of the product.
Many buyers have already completed the assembly within 2-3 days after receiving the product, so this is a completely meaningless act.
Hmmm
I'm a big fan of thermos and have been using straw type thermos for over 15 years, but this model is by far the easiest to use out of all the ones I've used so far. .
(1) The mouth part of the straw is made of a harder material than before, and the groove fits into the main body so that the mouth part of the straw cannot be removed from the main body!
! I desperately tried to take it and broke my nails. .
(2) Only the tip of the drinking mouth part of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush cannot be inserted.
③The mysterious part called the valve attached to the tip of the straw is thicker than the straw brush, making it extremely difficult to wash.
I've never been dissatisfied with the straw type so far, so it's a bit of a shock.
It is really stressful that the mouthpiece cannot be removed from the main body.
The good point is the outstanding cold storage power as usual.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and washed it the next day, there was still about 50% of the ice I put in the day before.
I don't drink hot, so I will continue to be a straw type.
Please improve it in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
I am reviewing for the first time.
(This is the impression of a non-professional who purchased a doll from scratch for the first time and has little knowledge of wearing doll eyes for the first time.) I received the product exactly as pictured.
When I put it on my Obitsu Doll, I was very satisfied with the light and cuteness.
However, it cannot be installed unless the fitting (entrance) is a little hard and pushed in.
I think the method is different, but I put tweezers into the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping This is the first time I've shipped from overseas, so I was aiming for three weeks, but it arrived earlier than I expected, in 8 days (near Narita Airport).
I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
When I looked at Amazon's shipping description, it said it was still being shipped.
There was no damage and no air in the eyes, and the back of the envelope was in a small sealed bag with a lot of bubble wrap, so I think it's safe.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is it safe to send personal information even though the mail is from overseas?
I felt a doubt, so I will make it minus 1.
I think that the product is a great bargain if it is this amount at that price without any problems.
Addendum Doll Eyes 8mm Model iPhonese
A little small (small work area), charging is severe
I ordered it after looking at the size notation, but I felt it was about two times smaller than I imagined.
Although it is larger than the A4 size, the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, so the workable range is narrower than the A4 size.
I was thinking of using it when repairing electronic equipment or making gunpla, but it's hard to use without B4 size.
If you use it only for the soldering iron work and use a different tray or mat for other work such as assembly and disassembly, it may be possible.
You can't put your tools down, put your parts down, and do more work in an area the size of a magazine.
I thought about ordering another one of the same type to double the area, but it was very electrified during work, and dust and cut parts would all stick to it. I think.
fatal flaw
After struggling to open the lid of the battery box, I finally opened it using a non-slip rubber sheet, but when I tried to close it after loading the batteries, it wouldn't close.
Out at this point.
Highly rated!
Can the lid of the battery box be closed? ? ?
In addition, instead of a protective sticker on the product, there was a small, fluffy saran wrap.
Is this a used item? ? ?
Speaking of explanations, only English written closely on a small piece of paper.
I don't understand the operation method at all without the explanation of the illustration.
It might be better if it's on another finger...
I found a good product!
I bought it immediately.
I use it for my pinky ring, so I had to use a lot of it to get it right and it was a little rough.
But I think it's good enough to use on other fingers.
But I think I'm a good idea merchant.
for the price
After all, you shouldn't expect quality from this kind of product.
One flower mark was crushed.
The size is just right when I put it on.
Those with thick ear lobes may find it difficult.
If anything, it might have been better to buy a patternless one.
dangerous
The design is good, but it feels big when you put it on your hand.
Eastern Hokkaido in the harsh winter...
As in other reviews, the heating wire is only 110 x 80 in net and the placement is horizontal instead of vertical.
I bought it because I wanted to warm the entire futon evenly, but it was more expensive than the futon type, but it was bigger, but I couldn't check it at the store like a famous manufacturer, so I wonder if it can't be helped.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and N warm of 0 birds.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
well done
Small size and plenty of airflow.
The battery can also be replaced with a spare.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it's good to do it like the picture.
If it is a smooth desk, it will be blown away by your own wind power, but if you lay a handkerchief there is no problem.
As for the sound, if you use it outside or at a family restaurant, you won't even notice it at "medium", but if you're at the office, it's too loud even at "small".
It is necessary to divide it as an attendant when going out.
Also, for office use, even if it is "small", the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It's perfect for when you're sweating on the go and want to escape to a family restaurant and cool off at once with a "big".
The only thing is that when I put it in my bag, on rare occasions, the power button is pressed and it keeps spinning without me knowing.
It would be nice to have some ideas, such as slightly retracting the button (causing it to sink in) or holding down the first weak button.
It's a must-have item in times of intense heat that can be life-threatening, so it would be helpful if you could make something better.
Multifunctional light speaker
I use the weakest warm color and put it in my bedroom.
Better than I expected!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color with a touch type.
The white color fits in any room, and the color light changes with gradation, so it's beautiful.
Also, if you touch your favorite color with one touch, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can light it up according to your mood!
Since it is an LED type, you can expect a long life.
As for the sound quality, I think it's more than enough for my amateur ears.
The great thing about this light is that it is multi-functional.
・There is a large speaker on the top.
You can enjoy music wirelessly with Bluetooth pairing with mobile phones.
・You can also make hands-free calls by pairing with a mobile phone.
・In addition, since it supports MicroSD, it can be linked with a personal computer and can be used as an mp3 player to play music.
typing and piano practice
At the age of 66, he started challenging DTM to prevent blurring.
I bought an audio interface and this unit.
At first, I was typing, but I became addicted to playing the piano, and I spend all my time practicing every day.
I downloaded the attached sound source, but the protection didn't work well, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but the free piano sound source sounds good, so I use it for piano practice.
I'm glad I bought it.
I feel deceived by how it looks.
Is the product a hit or miss?
It will be long.
The synthetic leather of the Doshisha office chair (flip-up armrest) that I used for 4-5 years has deteriorated and has fallen apart, so I am considering purchasing a non-synthetic leather chair with a flip-up armrest.
I searched home centers and furniture stores, but I couldn't find anything suitable.
I'm worried that I can't check the actual product, but I compromised on the appearance and price of the design and purchased this product on Amazon.
The box is surprisingly light and compact.
I have one spare screw.
[Caution] The attached hex wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I didn't know if there was oil on the hex wrench and the main body was white, so I was impatient when it got oil.
Assembled in 40 minutes.

The flip-up armrests have different hardness when raised and lowered on the left and right, the left is heavy and the right is light, and the armrests are not convenient (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak and hangs down immediately with a "click" sound.
The non-recycled high-density urethane foam feels hard on the seat, making it uncomfortable to sit on (weak elasticity?
) The competition mesh on the backrest is harder than other mesh chairs, and if you wear light clothes, your back will hurt.
It's a small detail, but the height from the seat to the ground was 530 instead of 550 (the height of the sitting height is important for tall people) And the legs that support the casters are not made of steel, so there are questions about durability.
A separately purchased cushion is laid out, and the mesh fabric part is likely to deteriorate (damage) quickly, so a towel blanket is used.
At 186 cm and 80 kg, I felt that only the fit on my back was good, but other than that, I think that the satisfaction level of the product is low, and I feel that it is a hit or miss product.
After all, it may be better to purchase an office chair by sitting on the actual product.
I received an Amazon email from the manufacturer asking for a purchase greeting, so should I inquire about the armrest and headrest?
under consideration.
Well, what is this?
In the environment of my house, it seems that I can see BS4K turning right, so I bought a 4K tuner from Pixela, which was cheap, without expecting much.
As an experiment, I was able to watch NHK BS4K and other right-turning free broadcasts, and I was able to enjoy them beautifully on a Panasonic 4K TV that I purchased at the same time.
(Sometimes the image is jerky) An update came soon after I bought it, and it became recording compatible, so I've been watching some scheduled recordings, but I wonder if the external 2.5 inch HDD is also affecting playback. It is a situation where only the image stops or frames are skipped.
The user interface has never been praised, and it is clear that "4K broadcasting can be seen".
By the way, during scheduled recording, it seems that you can only follow-up and play back the recorded program, and we accept this as a plus function that allows you to record in 4K on the HDD.
You may be disappointed if you purchase with various expectations, so do not expect too much.
Hope it gets better with updates.
Keep warm function is OK
I have only used the heat retention function so far, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in it, it got warm in about two hours, and it felt hot in two and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but the fan noise is annoying when the idling is stopped, but I don't feel it at all while driving.
Because it was still new, I was worried about the smell of chemical substances emitted by the fan, so I had to open the window regularly to ventilate.
As another person wrote in the review, the burr on the part where the shoulder strap is passed is terrible, so it is necessary to break the burr with a flathead screwdriver.
really fragile
Today, after 2 months of use, it suddenly broke.
I liked the feel of the keys and the size, but it doesn't make sense if it breaks.
I use a PC all day for video processing work, but the volume goes to 100% on its own.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
I can't use earphones because my ears hurt, and the volume is too loud to use my PC at night.
It seems that a signal is sent every few seconds, and the volume display repeatedly appears and disappears on the computer screen.
Furthermore, since the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, the mouse cannot be used freely unless the keyboard is turned off one by one.
The enter key and backspace key no longer respond.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's a thousand yen, you might want to try it.
If you are lucky, you can use it for half a year.
This is a 6-month warranty compared to the 1-3 year warranty for other companies in the same price range.
The short warranty period speaks to its fragility.
Good product, bad packaging
The product is a favorite because I use it in different colors.
I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a food stocker! !
However, the packing was the worst because there was a gap enough to roll around in a large cardboard box, and there was no delivery note.
The lid was missing when I opened the box.
I recommend the product, but it may be better to buy elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but for now
I bought a new lid because the support was gone.
It plays a role in the stability of the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make an unpleasant sound.
You have to choose the one that matches the thickness of the lid, so be careful when purchasing.
cute meatball bag
I have a dog and when I was looking for a bag to go out with, I was attracted to a stylish gray bag and purchased this one.
It's a stand-up type, and it's surprisingly light when I pick it up, so it didn't feel that heavy even when I held it.
The zipper moves smoothly and there are no snags.
It seems to be comfortable even on long trips.
It's very compact and easy to fold.
You can see the design of the paws even when it is folded, and it is cute even when placed.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use round and round.
First of all, I fell in love at first sight with its appearance and low price! I bought it.
The TSA lock has been my favorite for several years, and I have several others, but they are convenient.
And as a master of forgetting and losing keys, number lock is recommended.
However, to be honest, I put the most important point on lightness, so it's fine. If you cut it, it will break instantly.
Also, the fasteners are not easy to match, so I would like to have a way to overlap them.
It is recommended for carry-on when traveling abroad.
For the time being, I used it on a Shinkansen trip, but it was comfortable.
Difficult to choose size.
I have a hard time buying shoes because of my wide feet.
Converse and vans wear 24cm.
MRL996 is also 24cm.
Is it hard at first? I thought, but I'm fine when I get used to it.
My older sister said 24.5cm was too tight for the ML574 this time and when I let her wear it, it was definitely too tight.
It felt like my little finger.
That's why I bought 25cm.
When I received it and opened it, it was huge.
When I put them on, they were a little loose even with socks on.
I was wondering if I should return it, but it would be troublesome if I changed it to 24.5 and it would be too tight, so I'm going to wear it as it is at 25 with insoles.
I bought team red, and it's a bright red and it's very good!
Many black and white clothes are monotone, so wearing this will brighten up your outfit!
165 cm, male in his 40s
I ordered the L size randomly, but if you have similar specifications as below, I recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm I have a typical metabolic syndrome.
<Comfortable use> Underwater, the rash guard rolls up, probably because the waist is loose.
He is swimming while fixing the curled up part.
Especially if you are off guard in the jacuzzi, your metabolic syndrome will be exposed.
Also, if you walk while exercising vigorously up and down, it will roll up from the bottom.
<Manufacturing> The fabric is durable and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples showing through.
At this price, you can be satisfied with this build, but I think it would fit better if you purchased a smaller size.
I still had a gas leak...
The Silver Colt 25 was still leaking gas, and when I replaced the valve, there was a problem that part of the tank was missing, but I used [Busbond Q] to seal the tank and grease it up for repair so that I could hit it smoothly. Now, if you want to buy this Colt 25, ask someone who can disassemble and assemble it. It might be fun. At that time, I applied silicon grease to the spring and small parts and assembled them while fixing them with grease. When disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the screw on the safety, remove the safety, remove the two screws on the left side of the body, and remove the barrel. Take care not to damage the tip of the front sight and the inner barrel by using pliers so as not to pinch the front sight and the inner barrel. Don't blame people.
I was wondering what kind of quality it was for 188 yen.
It can be used properly when fast turning and when torque is required.
It's light and small, and above all, I like the simplicity of it.
There is no looseness when the bit is attached, and I thought it was an amazing cost performance for 188 yen.
It's just a matter of durability.
It may not be used that often, but I think it's good to put it in the tool box.
I purchased it together with "1/4 inch hex shank magnetic quick release screwdriver knurled bit holder 60/100/150 mm" from the same vendor.
No problem here, it was pretty good for the price.
controller stuck
The machine moves on its own and becomes uncontrollable.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the machine moves in an unexpected direction and becomes inoperable.
It is better not to buy this product.
Let me warn you all.
It's a terrible product.
Although it is wired, we recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It is highly reliable and has not broken even after using it for a long time.
It can also be used for PC games.
・・・・ Addendum I was able to get a refund for the Amazon gift card because it was returned as a defective product within a month, so I think that was good.
Will this increase computing power?
Suitable for children who understand math.
Isn't it impossible unless the child understands calculation to some extent?
The problem is difficult to understand.
Also, when I give tools to my master, I slide my finger on the screen, but I tried doing it myself, but no matter how many times I did it, it didn't go smoothly.
In short, it may be easy for people who are used to DS to slide. ?
I don't really like the illustrations of people in comics, or rather, I think people like the DS because of the fun of the screen... but for some reason I don't feel familiar with them.
The method of calculation is also a method of competing for time, for example, how many questions can be answered correctly in a few minutes.
I understand how you feel about making them rush for exams, but...why don't you make them rush to do calculations?
I also don't like the gong ringing when it ends.
Even though we are working hard, why not make the sound more pleasant?
I feel like I lost 6,200 yen with this.
I understand if it's half the price.
I'm sorry, I ended up with 2 ☆ because of this.
After all, Persona's songs are good!
Persona 3 reached the ED.
5 played halfway through.
Persona 4 has been troconed on the vita.
What you can do hasn't changed from the previous Persona 4.
It feels shorter than the previous work because there is no story.
The song is really cool!
Just listening to it makes me feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were in HD for the first time, so I was moved when I first saw them.
Somehow Junpei looked handsome (lol) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so it doesn't have anything new... If you think about it, I feel like Persona 3 is more profitable.
As a sound game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.
Blue is the main color of Persona 3, but it was difficult to see if the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if it is covered with the background.
There are plenty of assist functions, so I think even people who aren't good at music games can play.
Sound game experts may turn on the challenge function to make the game more crunchy.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not just a bonus, it's a solid 4-disc set, so if you like Persona songs, I recommend this one.
I'm sorry
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual product has a bluish tinge, but it is close to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but it's on hold at the moment.
Postscript After posting the review, I received an apology from the seller and an email to the effect that I would exchange it for a new product.
Subsequent processing was quick.
I think that the response was very good despite the cheap product.
4 stars for correspondence Postscript After that, gold is also purchased.
I think the colors are very pretty, just like the picture.
But after all the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the explanation photo is clear.
That's the only disappointment.
The evening gets very heavy.
We used for iPhone7s of SIM-free.
At the first setting, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing the SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to teach me (Settings > Mobile communication > Communication options Turn on data roaming ), which worked well.
The instruction manual attached to the product didn't seem to have much to do with it...?
However, around Gimpo Airport, I was grabbing 3G all the time, probably because the radio wave condition was bad.
When I went out into the city, it became 4G.
In the evening and at night, the communication sometimes became very slow, but now that I think about it, it may have reached the upper limit of several hundred MB per day.
better than i thought
I used Softbank Z4 for 2 years, made it sim-free and used it with Ymobile, and since Z4 was not working well, I was looking for a second-hand Xperia, so I found this new phone that can use Osaifu mobile phones and bought it.
I was using Mobile Suica, so I was worried if I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so it looks like an iPhone6 at first glance? That's my impression.
I don't play games, so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, and I have the impression that it's a little faster. , is used here.
I thought it was amazing because it was like an iPhone.
What I was worried about It could be a little smaller There is no strap hole *Compatible with a case with a strap hole I haven't tested the water resistance It's a bit heavy I've only used it a little but I'm satisfied Recommended
