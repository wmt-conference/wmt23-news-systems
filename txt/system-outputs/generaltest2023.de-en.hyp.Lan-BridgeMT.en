Geesthacht: New beet signs should encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blooms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors White and Pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blooms" is a Nabu campaign in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, day-care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015. : In the Geesthachter urban area, flowering islands are to be created over a wide area, on which insects can find food at any time. In favorable weather conditions, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthachter Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
s explaining the plants are put up again and again so that the undertaking not only remains an action of conservationists and the city's environmental specialist service, but also extends to the private gardens. About 50 Signs are there so far. Passers-by should be able to find out in this way what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will deliberately replant at home.
In the first week of January, the Wildhasel had already started the season.
r dates are shrubs such as Winterduftheckenkirsche and Wintersneeball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. for a year now in the soil of the buckets on Bergedorer Straße, they are showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given other signs. "The winter-scented cherry tree is a very broad bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," it reads, among other information, about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bedding plants that are now in bloom. n the first week of January was already the start of the season for Wildhasel. It blooms particularly lushly on the Richtweg near the incline, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
- Tanz-Gott Fred Astaire would surely be proud of her if he looked down from the sky to the Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m. sharp for a floating step dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday. Birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) von der Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and stepping is my life, I can't imagine without it".
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing the dancing legs.
The 97-year-old is 1926 in Jena (Thuringia geborgen). She was a soubrette, today one would say Musical-Actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I have spent my life with dancers, actors and singers".
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the group of tap dancers. "We're just having fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl," she says.
Wikipedia: Steppantance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are generated during dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is the colloquial Tap dance and the French Claquettes. Spanish Flamenco may have influenced the Stepptanz. The toes of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studios at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, we are big and small, old and young are welcome".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? The movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol".
- The limits of the digital
As digitization progresses, the desire for analog grows again for some
The speed with which our everyday life went digital left us little time to set up rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. either one was among the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call their relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you looked up a phone booth. get the smell of the plastic receivers and the clicking of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do this. Recean was one of the President's advisors.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the wars. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
n the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.

Oberhof: Kühn Eighth in the World Championship Sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 world titles and joins his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even sometimes heavy fog does not prevent the permanent winner Bö from already collecting his second Gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay had already been enough for a successful title defense.
Hardly anyone doubts that in the chase race number three will follow. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so that he can compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent, frighteningly easy.
At Doll, meanwhile, nothing ran together again. fter the veteran had missed every chance of a medal at the start with a penalty loop in the mixed relay and there was only sixth place, things didn't get any better three days later. penalty laps already in prone shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who in 2017 had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline.
n he surprisingly won Infilzen six years ago with a razor-thin lead of 0.7 seconds over Bö. t was one of only three career successes for Dolls, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. After his weak performance, the Beijing Olympia-Eighth pulled away without a word and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, second World Cup debutant David Zobel took 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
n a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is primarily about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
During a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden insisted on preserving democratic values.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." with a view to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: "Brazilians have isolated themselves for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by heavy riots. Bolsonaro supporters had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasilia in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is grimly reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol a good two years ago, during which supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently broke into the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much in international relations. "His world began and ended with Fake News, mornings, afternoons and evenings," Lula said. "It sounds familiar to me," Biden replied - an obvious nod to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note on the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF wanted posters? You could see the members of the Red Army faction released for denunciation and shooting down.
n a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, such a public mood was created, against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is otherwise more after Raudis in the S-Bahn or Onanists in the Park, is giving a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is ill-informed, because there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world that include Asia, Africa and Latin America than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not what it's about, but: In 1st to 5th place (!) is Ms. Wagenknecht, then Ms. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I no longer know anyone around me who reads this sheet. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the known level, where nothing is below it anymore.
And at the latest now, well dialectically, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all the not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no differentiation is now necessary.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth

SS-Massakers in Oradour-sur-Glane: Letzter Survivor tot
n the devastated village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved, a memorial center was set up in 1999.

He also contributed to Franco-German peace. The survivor had campaigned, among other things, for Franco-German youth encounters.
A curve layout for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
-Serie Nordlippische Weiler: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here the residents find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles a day sometimes brew along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even come back right away.
Deutsche Bank boss Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against the high inflation rate to be "absolutely" necessary. "The inflationary risks are still great. Energy costs can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give a temporary boost to prices," Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag".
February, the European Central Bank (ECB) had raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and promised a further increase by another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. Higher interest rates on loans can also lead to investment being postponed and thus to weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are significantly more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course we have to keep that in mind, but a high level of debt must not stop the ECB from acting consistently."
For the euro area, the ECB is aiming for medium-term price stability with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, but consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent above the level of the same months of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro. The sharp rise in energy prices, which significantly drive inflation, is also a burden for companies.
f inflation remains high, private consumption will "sooner or later collapse," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). I currently see this as the greatest danger for the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch boss Stefan Hartung is hoping for a broad debate on the "Germany-tempo" in infrastructure projects proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And it will perhaps also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out, with which it does not necessarily have to be as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
n mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply to some extent due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany-tempo". In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the garden of the neighbor against his will. ", said Hartung. There must therefore still be a process of negotiating what society finds right and wrong.
In the past, attempts have been made with the classic set of rules and have not succeeded. "We should think again about whether the previous procedure was really right. Maybe we overdid it with the rules and made it too complicated for us".
n view of the many open tasks, for example in the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible".
Union warns against breaking up Bayer-Konzerns
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the group after an announced change of boss at Bayer. From the point of view of the employees, Bayer with its three mainstays is exactly positioned for the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board, of the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
are the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health area with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy that is based on risk diffusion and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism".
The background is the change of boss at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial Chef Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. At the beginning of June, the ex-pharmaceutical boss of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over.
Baumann has long been under criticism. The 2018 completed acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars hangs on the Manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks from the weed killer Glyphosat into the house. Bayer shares were in a downward spiral for years. n 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has long been known that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which should actually run until 2024. long-term oriented strategic Investors. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split of the group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health Division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the "Rheinische Post". On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against Rentenreform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
A government project, the unions counter the concentrated protest on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected again nationwide on Saturday, who want to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the central government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants in protests were counted. A turbulent debate has been going on in Parliament for a week about the controversial reform.
Many people in France already work longer than until the age of 62, when they have not yet paid in long enough for a deductible pension when they reach the age limit. n many strenuous professions, people could hardly work longer, say the opponents of the reform. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not have their health completely worn out on the job.
Macron: Impending deficit in Rentenkasse
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, the employees would have to pay with their contributions for an increasing number of pensioners. order for the level of the pension to be kept stable, the population must work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government does not only want to screw on the retirement age. The increase in the necessary deposit period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension should increase to around 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of the most important projects of President Macron. n the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - broad protests and strikes were all certain.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Republicans, who have announced their support. However, some of the deputies - even from Macron's parliamentary group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote is likely to be Macron's concern about crippling strikes at the moment. f the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the President said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they would be calm and not lead to a blockade of the country.
s Calm weather expected - lots of sun at high altitudes
A powerful high pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that a lot of sunshine is to be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. n looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high will shift a little to the east over the next week. However, the weather in Germany will continue to be determined."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sleepy weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give the people in the lowlands sad high fog gray for days, while in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges there is pure sun".
This is how Sunday starts in most foggy-cloudy regions. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, according to the DWD, it can also rain a little. especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west the cloud cover loosens up in the course of the day and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country it remains heavily cloudy or covered with high fog. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, in the vicinity of the Rhine around 10 degrees.
On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble on the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more over the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, the sun is expected all day, elsewhere it first has to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine they are 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, only 3 degrees are expected. Weak winds blow from different directions.
On Tuesday in some lowlands there can again only be a tough resolution of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather after the fog clears is clear. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, according to forecasts, the sun shines all day. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominatorin hadert: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia was very disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can," the Italian said on ZDF after threading in a goal and being eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhiller in the World Cup for years. she has won four of the previous six races of the season in this discipline. Gold 2018 in Pyeongchang she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, has to wait for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline. t her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago she was absent due to injury.
"I actually thought I'd be in a good mood. It was a hundredth of a second," said Goggia after the surprise victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not."

y and Minister against Russia's Olympia-participation
Kyiv. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
n a joint conference call it was agreed to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Sports Ministry said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place at the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made the position of Great Britain very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now make a joint statement on this issue."
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. while Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Zelenskyy said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag was ultimately soaked in blood and not portable.
Ukraine threatens to boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a warring party because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelenskyy called on the officials to work for the protection of the Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The President also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC that it wanted to enable athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine also threatens a boycott should the IOC allow the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior responsible for sport stated that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it would reject a start for Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. From our point of view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The effort of the IOC to resume the Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," said a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior when asked by dpa.
at the end of January, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the ban on discrimination.

Half of the vehicles lost? : USA sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
Lost half of the vehicles? USA sees Moscow's Panzer stock severely decimated
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. We are talking about the "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army had been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
t an online event of the think tank Center for a New American Security, Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Great Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2 battle tanks for March. In a coalition with other states, Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The US has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, their delivery is likely to take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
n response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev held out the prospect of building and modernising thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for planes, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is a matter of course for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks".
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows for a stronger orientation of the economy towards the needs of the army. This means that, for example, individual sectors can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
a Post filling vortex at Heer
Because the post, which the former director of the Military History Museums (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment to a previously unfilled job takes place, according to the minister. She did not want to comment on "speculation by a liberal personnel representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. n addition to criticism of the Museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanners' point of view, these have been cleared up.
k also doubts the content suitability of Ortners. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". to the decision the "appearance of Postenschacher", says SPÖ-Wehrmacht spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are asking Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the swamp of corruption," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for state defense. he announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: The first fools get down on their knees before costs
s Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs, among other things for security, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kissling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total costs for the move.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades are cancelled. The "train of happy people" in Cottbus, probably once again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time since the pandemic. No parades were canceled at the Swabian-Germanic Fastnacht either.
Schleswig-Holsteins Karnevalshochburg Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We are going through with our event," says the President of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. But here, too, the financial concerns are pressing: If even more sponsors were not found or the previous ones were even more close, reserves would have to be touched - "that's not possible every year". The current deficit: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: There is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent for confectionery, says Elvira Reuther from the Nürnberger Fastnachtszug association. by luck in misfortune 2020 had been ordered too much, which is why this time there is still enough stock. For the move, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. For security, twice as many personnel are needed as in 2020.
who stands at the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland am Wegesrand, could get less Kamelle than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have as much with them. Camel or not, the rush of visitors should be large: "I think if it doesn't rain from buckets that day, then we can definitely expect an increased rush of people," says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that for two years no regular Rose Monday procession has taken place. Of course, the procession cannot be replaced by anything."
The Festkomitee in Cologne does not comment on the costs in detail. But the train is generally "deficit", that is no secret.
The Ukrainian Diary: Dreams and Self-Burned Vodka
The Ukrainians are not considered in vain as a drinking festival. There are local beers such as Obolon from Kyiv or Bier from Lemberg. I always find German beers here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't see much difference in taste. The same applies to vodka, which is widely available. They burn it here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. Exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics, nobody knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little you can believe the Russians. It means that as a tourist you should be careful with it. But that only applies if he goes into the mass sale. then it will probably also be gepanscht.

Biathlon-WM: The Federal President sees Favoritensieg and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the Arena by Schornsteinfeger-Meister Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the awarding of medals at the World Championships Sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
as hard as the Federal President tried, it was not clear from the grandstand on Saturday whether the windows on the shooting range really fell. "I had to get the results on my cell phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, referring to the wafts of fog that kept moving into the stadium, which severely impaired the view of the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed attending the 10-km sprint races at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, and received numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by the Biathlon", he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say the same - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the World Championships were awarded". In terms of sustainability, too, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades".
In terms of sport, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again surpassed the competition. spite a penalty loop after a shooting error, he secured his sixth win in the sixth Sprint of the Winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. behind him made his flawless shooter Brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) make the Norwegian quadruple win perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the battle for the medals a day after the Denise Herrmann-Wicks Triumph. Johannes Kühn took eighth place as the best German after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawless and finished 12th (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. his botched mixed mission on Wednesday, the Black Forester left five discs this time and disappeared as a 55. deeply disappointed and without comment in the cabin.
had entered the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. : In his last two standing shots, however, he had the good fortune of being strong; they each landed on the edge of the discs and fell anyway. ng the award ceremony, the 29-year-old then enjoyed it together with his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's chase. For women, on the other hand, German hopes for Herrmann-Wick rest. If you start with the number one, the goal is not to get in as a tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," sporting director Felix Bitterling took his "locomotive" to task. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 p.m. and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "Beenenschwarm" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on Referee Ball.
gressively running players or complaining coaches? Germanys Referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. -Chief referee Fröhlich points to a role model function.
The top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in togetherness on the field. I do find that there are new behaviors of the players that surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to that again - and we will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches had also been given place references. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburgs coach Christian Streich there was the league defeat in Dortmund Yellow-Red. "Coaching behavior also falls into the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike behavior has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanlike behavior," said Brych.
DFB-Chief Referee Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and referees. Overall, the ratio fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned then has to live with this. that shouldn't be anything world-moving," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In the most recent cases, those involved would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if then a process of rethinking as a whole got underway, that such behavior simply does not belong," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible repercussions on another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always fade away. There is a role model effect, resulting in imitation. n recent cases in the Bundesliga the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviours," Fröhlich said. regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful".

s after building collapse in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after buildings collapsed during the earthquakes. Arrest warrants have been issued against 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Saturday, citing law enforcement officials. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have favored the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the suspects was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine more people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.

st Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow has died
Hans Modrow is dead, as announced by the left-wing faction in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," said the left-wing faction in the Bundestag on Saturday. The party thus loses "an important personality", explained the parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch and the former parliamentary group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the District Executive of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for around 150 days. n the Volkskammer elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow took office a month later. He was the last Prime Minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The parliamentary group leader of the Left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
into old age he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be lacking."
The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was precisely a special merit of his. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. it goes on to say:
His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated".
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow saw the new state "quite critically". too quickly German unity was achieved, too unconditionally the GDR was lost, and too unilaterally it was condemned as an "unjust state", according to dpa, Modrow criticized in many interviews.
What happened in the night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Selenskyj condemns Russian missile attacks. ndes must carry out Kiew Notreparaturen on the power grid.
Kiev - The recent wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing Notreparaturen on the Ukrainian energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants were damaged, the head of the Ukrenerho energy supplier, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. n view of the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant, and production was curtailed at the Rivne and southern Ukrainian nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to let the small town of Bachmut down.
On February 24th there will be war for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger from Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kyiv, late Friday evening for the fifth time for this day, an air alarm was triggered. There is a threat of a drone attack," said the military administration of the Kyiv region. Iranian-designed combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolajiw and Odessa areas in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Bund selects consultant for network company
among others, the demands of the FDP and the Greens from the election campaign to split them off failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, it was agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. That is, it does not need to generate and withdraw profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms should help the federal government to accompany this process. The renovation backlog in the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very unpunctually. Minister of Transport Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to more recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon-WM in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
the external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann-Wick at all. she would have slept badly, she said after the race, she was "totally excited", the pulse did not drop even when running in. such a race", and that at the home World Cup, "you can't describe it with words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, supervisors and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", that was what she had planned to do.
For Herrmann-Wick the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as Germany's biggest, if not only, medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she currently occupies fifth place. And even if the performance density among the women at the top is significantly higher than among the men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, they had others on the list for this sprint victory.
criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of left-leaning heads of state. Ortega accuses of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation had taken refuge in churches. n the protests in 2018 more than 350 people were killed. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the years that followed, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: The armaments industry is demanding more orders from special funds
The first armaments projects have therefore already been canceled, other projects are threatened with the same, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag". Which specific investments would be eliminated, but it is not yet possible to say. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a request from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment sum is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which the Bundestag decided in June 2022, must bear the interest burden for the loans itself. If these increase, there is less money available for concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum is decreasing.
zell: Accident with 3 injured
n the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 1.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive on the Autobahn at the Kupferzell Autobahn entrance to the left in the direction of Heilbronn. t this moment a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police announced. When the BMW driver turned, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system revealed no objections. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The two cars suffered property damage totaling approximately 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgarter commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
On Friday evening, many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib-Moscheegemeinde
tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. is great - also in Stuttgart.
earthquake disaster in Turkey and in Syria is occupying the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people commemorated the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib-Moscheegemeinde, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's Bittgebet seriously and silently. n the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they too could overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asks for assistance and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands with the people of Turkey and Syria. The spokesmen expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration event. The prayers were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association of the Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has been collecting donations in kind on Glockenstraße for several days, which are to be brought by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should take a rest or a thousand steps".... The older ones know the proverb, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has undergone an unexpected renaissance. Because if, thanks to the home office, you are not sitting in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, you now use the lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as an alternative for a walk into the fresh air. t you could at least get this impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 2 p.m. not only dog owners cavort.
One reason, of course, could also lie in the fact that modern man, in the course of an optimal use of the time slot, can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things. Because why not on the occasion of a short march through nature from the neighbor who has not been seen for a long time learn news from the settlement? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evenings, not even to the old cinema? In this way, work and private life could also be combined - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? Unless there are foreign ears nearby, of course.
What you can also do amazingly is the acquisition of Naturalien. Fresh fruit, for example, which, along with cheese, stands on a table along the way. Or potatoes and meat. only if you have not already considered the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voices. "It's a shame, unfortunately we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, since you yourself have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you also let the sympathetic random acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! You do have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which was quickly thrown over before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife has always packed everything in!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat and on this short midday excursion you have not only become richer by a lamb loin, but also by an extremely practical idea. t is quite possible that on this day a second walk is due - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
and seriously injured
around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and came off the road to the right in a left turn for reasons that have not yet been clarified, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a delineator post, crashed sideways into a tree and came to a stop a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The rescue service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of being unfit to drive, a blood sample was taken. According to the Totalschaden police report, the Audi was built in the amount of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: a point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has ruled: The tax authority must turn over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
2018, Trump was still in the office of President of the United States at that time
The Treasury Department must direct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the department's decision said Friday.
Contrary to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as President. until before the Supreme Court against a surrender. A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a trial.
s to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There the circle of those entitled to access is somewhat larger and under certain conditions individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information is repeatedly leaked out of Parliament.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their undermining of our security as president," Pelosi declared.

British criminal after a long escape in Thailand gefasst
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. As the British criminal police NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police officers in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the NCA's most wanted criminals.

Kabarett - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The studied physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statements, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. fits the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again". Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic scientific skepticism here remains to be seen. n any case, his humor goes very well to Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. but now he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what Wissenaft actually is and what it can do - and above all what it can't. Of course, Corona also occurs, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a vast valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which offer the player temporary protection, as these cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super-tankers, as well as nimble missiles, which, during the extended game sequences, are increasingly difficult to hit. additionally appear at periodic intervals UFO's. These cannot attack the player-tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score with a UFO hit. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction sequence, the game introduction sequence, the game abl on, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test sequence. The latter mode of operation represents a special procedure for checking the control elements and the computer function.
4. Game sequence
The game sequence is triggered when the pressure switch START is actuated. The LED switch remains illuminated and the playing noises become audible. If the last player-tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game begins with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by observing the displayed text in the upper left pointing display angle of his cockpit. can be e.g.: OBJECTORS OF RIGHTS. n addition, a point representing the enemy position becomes visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone.
The upper, conical surface on the radar screen represents the field of view of the players on the underlying screen. If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to target on the screen. GNER IM FEUERBEREICH is also displayed in the upper left indication display at the same time.
momentarily UFO's become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the combat action and distract the player, as these usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or rockets. UFO's can be eliminated from both the Player-Panzer and the Enemy-Panzer. A shot by the player brings the player 5,000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and rotates twice as fast as the player tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several options give the exhibitor the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence. Furthermore, after reaching the specified points, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a further more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector switch for this adjustment possibility can be found in the figure.
5. Initial input at Maximum results
f a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of highest scores, he or she can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that with the triggering of a self-test, the tapping of the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or an interruption of the mains voltage, the table with the highest results is deleted. Upon deletion (RESET) the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are obtained and rewritten on the screen to challenge other players. Any score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. f a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, strokes are automatically written by the computer. fter that, the device switches back into the Attraction game sequence. ASSEMBLY
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI shift lever. it was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, whereby this structural unit became more stable and a proper functioning of the switch contacts is ensured. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever into the center position. For easier replacement, the microschalters are now fastened with self-locking nuts. Two PC-Boards. ATARI'S X/Y-Play circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the Auxiliary Platinum. With the help of these switching techniques k, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in a uniform and calm image. . The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply provided by the expansion of the circuit. . The Gerate housing. Due to the new design it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin-holding capacity. n the device there is also a console, which is intended for smaller players as a podium, in order to facilitate playing. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability on the stand.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. f one of these new parts is mentioned in the handbook, you will find this sign. 2.Equipment Inspection
fter removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should do some checking to round off the quality control. n order to be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: The device is not yet connected to the 220 V network. . Examine the outside of the housing for damage. . Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness plugs for correct and fixed connection. Possible open or loose connectors to connect to each other.
: Plug connections are never made by force. The plugs are provided with a positive guide so that a correct connection is made. A 180 degree twisted plug connection destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the Game-PC-Platinum for the correct and fixed seat. Note the production number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check that the punched production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC-Platine, Auxiliary PC-Platine, Regulator/Audio II-PC-Platine and TV-Monitors. n the back of the cover sheet of this manual is an illustration of the place where the production number is attached. This number should always be given when you call your specialist dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply unit, the control console and the TV monitor for proper assembly. Bend the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. With a look through the player's viewing glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange circled opening of the fairing. f the opening is not exactly centered, the covering, which is attached to the housing with an adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the mains unit 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
HAVE YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? below are a number of tips that can help you solve most of the problems associated with current DirectX games. Check the system configuration
Please take the time and check that your system meets the requirements listed on the package. DirectX diagnostic program allows you to get an overview of your system if you are not sure whether your PC meets the requirements. Please proceed as follows to call the DirectX diagnostic program: Click on the “Start” button and select the “Execute” option. Type in the text field "dxdiag". The user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is now displayed. Here you have access to all relevant Systemdetails, including information about the graphics and sound card. You can, among other things, check if the graphics and sound work properly by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. : If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise against changing some of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before the start of the games
It may happen that other programs take over the system resources that the game needs to run flawlessly. not all of these Programs it is obvious that they are active, and many are automatically started when the System is started up. Such programs, which are constantly active on their system, are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. We therefore recommend that you end such background applications before you start the game. - If antivirus or Crash Guard programs are running on your System, you should close or disable them before you start the game. Look for the program icon in the Windows taskbar. Right click on the icon and select the appropriate option (“Deactivate” “Close”, or similar). - Once you have deactivated the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also terminate general background applications, as these sometimes lead to problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to end all unnecessary background applications". The system cleans up
Before you install Software, you must ensure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need for this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, defragmentation and data carrier cleaning to make everything run smoothly. n the chances are high that current games on your PC will run largely without problems. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you otherwise use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to find out about the ScanDisk or error checking, defragmentation and data carrier cleaning tools. Use of Windows Help
1. Click on the ‘Start’ button and select the ‘Help’ (or ‘Help and Support’) option to call Windows Help. 2. Now click on the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. ‘ScanDisk’ (Win 98/ME), ‘Error check’ (Win 2000/XP), ‘Defragmentation’ and ‘Data carrier cleansing’. You will then receive a guide explaining how you can use these tools.
Does the game crash or hang?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This way you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INITIATING WORDS TO DRIVE
The desire to develop video games was ignited in me by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with the help of which one could push the world to its limits. presented me with a way to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technique, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything still had to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. to be quite honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that the video games exploited only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too out for “action” and forgot about a fundamental element of the human world of experience: the sensations. n the meantime, the technology continued to make rapid progress. nheit represents my contribution to making video games a true, sensation-transmitting medium of expression. although this could of course have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. is proof that you can definitely create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting vile monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but also has much more sophisticated and in-depth content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. f you are rather skeptical about video games, I can hope that Fahrenheit will help change your attitude in this regard. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. nteractivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first. n the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented for the entire Quantic Dream team an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure in which we were repeatedly forced to question many of the principles previously considered irrefutable. I would consider myself lucky if Fahrenheit - similar to books, films and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also passes you by not completely without a trace. David Cage
THE README-DATEI
n the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM there is a ReadMe file in which the license agreement and updated information about the game can be viewed. We recommend that you look at this file so that you can take note of the changes that have still been made after printing this manual. n order to view the file, double-click on it in the Fahrenheit directory on your hard drive (usually C:\Programs\Atari\Fahrenheit). You can also call up the ReadMe file, however, by first clicking on the start button of the Windows® taskbar and then successively selecting “Programs”, “Atari”, “Fahrenheit” and finally the ReadMe file.
AND INSTALLATION
1. Start Windows® 2000/XP. 2. Insert the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM into the DVD-ROM drive. 3. When the “AutoPlay” option is enabled, the title screen should appear. f "AutoPlay" is not activated or the installation does not start automatically, click on the Start button of the Windows® taskbar and then on "Execute". D:\Setup, and then click "OK". : If your DVD-ROM drive is assigned a letter other than "D", use it accordingly. 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation of the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM. 5. Once the installation is finished, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar and select Program/Atari/Fahrenheit/Fahrenheit to start the game. : The DVD-ROM drive must be in the DVD-ROM drive for you to play.

With the help of the "Sub-Test" switches, the languages can be set. f the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. -Programming. With this display, the difficulty factor for the game can be determined. Furthermore, a "maximum number of loans", which may be before the start of the game, can be set. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test-" switches (appears green), the value desired for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times, the factory or basic setting can be reached when the lowest line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the lines appearing green) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program display. " [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to transfer the High Score points to the next program display until "High Hit Rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs in order for their own initials (names) and hits to be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. f the limit is exceeded, - if there is a coin lock - the coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin the credits cannot become zero when over 99 is added. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum Credit" to O. : "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": The amount of the % number that must be reached in order to switch to the next round
"Time limit": release for additional Sparx
difficulty": the degree of difficulty of the game sequences

The credits per coin are set on the "Insert Slot Programming" display. High-Score-Program-Display (Highest-Trefferquote so far"). The hit points and initials of the players appear, including the next 10 points. The values are used to set to Highscore which were selected on the previous display (set from "back"). By pressing the "Up" switches, the Initials QIX Standard are set. Pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "Overall Evaluation". By pressing the "Up"-switches can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total-Credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts all over again. The total number can only appear to 0 when the battery or plug connection W1 is removed, with the device switched off. Coins on the left side: Number of coins inserted in the coin insertion slot on the left. middle coins: (not present) Right-hand coins: number of coins inserted - in the right-hand coin insertion slot. Loans Paid: The number of loans that are given for coined (converted coins). Loans Granted: Number of loans given by the device. % Free Plays: Granted Loans (paid + granted loans per 100) Played Minutes: Number of minutes played. Minutes gained: Number of minutes, with extended or won games. % Free time: Minutes gained/minutes played per 100. Average playing time in Sek.: Played minutes/paid + Credits granted

slot-programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, a standard coin setting can be selected by the display or another setting can be programmed.
If a default setting is provided, programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The magnitude values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is taken over. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by actuating the "Sub-Test" switch. After a single press, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and changing only the values that are not suitable. As soon as the setting has taken place, by actuating the "Sub-Test" switches, each new size to be set can be selected. n case of unwanted pressing, the default setting appears. With the "Up" and "Down" switches, the values can be increased or reduced. by pressing the "Test" switch, the process is finished. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") tells how many coin units are given for each coin - thrown in through an associated slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" Coin Units shows the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min.-Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. In the default setting, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (MEMORY) FALL
f "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory standard settings. This condition probably indicates a failure or fault of the battery.

Beginning of the test method. the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test' button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" switches the next program is displayed. f a continuous test of the video board is desired, the Self-Test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in the Auto-Test mode. With this program, the device will perform the hardware test continuously until it is switched off. f the "Open Coin Door to Test" display appears, the Program Plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the J 19 plug is removed, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware-Tests: These Tests are performed as follows: O = out / I = one / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. f a difference is present, the device stops and the value of the ROM's with the wrong checksum appears on the LED's. If the checksum ROM is hopeless, U 10 is displayed first. f this test is not successful, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM Memory in a given game can be introduced as Banks (Series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM-Type for each series is chosen by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory, which is shared by two processors, by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED-Value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt with the o.a. Display holds, an error has been discovered. f the Communications RAM's fail during the Video Board Tests, the failure may have been caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or a failure in the Data Board. To locate the error, remove the Data-Board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: a fault in U 3, U 4 or the circuits connected to it.
Video Board CMOS RAM
nce values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. f the test has been passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED-Value: 00 0011 If the device with the o.a. Display holds, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the circuits connected to them or the decoding.
Video-Board-Color-RAM test by storing predetermined number sequences in the color-RAM. These numbers are checked for correctness when reading back. LED-Value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, an error is present. Check U 56, U 57, the multiplexer and decoder connected to them.
Video-Board (RAM display). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared with the original sample. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LED's indicate the faulty RAM. f a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. f this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LED's), it is indicated that the next test is started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for Star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable seam defects. BUT I guess I was looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. based on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she's supposed to sit so tight and I didn't want to fight in an S or M with my bust.... In the end it would have fit in terms of length and hip...the rest I could swim. In addition, the feed material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and was distributed everywhere. Just damage.. It will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered them for our daughter, she is totally enthusiastic. She usually wears the 158 and she fits the 36 quite well in this case and will certainly be worn for the next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately I was presumptuous and the edition does not quite fit. But what is my fault. then slightly changed something so it's passt. The support looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the whole area. The hat worked without any problems. t nix plus. I would buy again immediately.
unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is okay, but not less than a year. Since the area for chewing is much too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use him for size. t now at 12 months we have looked for him out again and he can use it. Hasn't been able to bite anything with his few existing teeth either. And when he was in the fridge, calm down it's him very much.
Insufficient quality / Unfortunately Geht back
I have let myself be dazzled here by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I would like to inform you that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. as I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read through many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came yesterday, disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for less than 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... People, that's just not true! had really hoped that it is so, but there really can be no talk of it. The upholstered walls are significantly thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more labrile. Overall, the feel of this rucksack is not comparable to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are also not exactly of high quality. I have decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to spend the money for a decent backpack. Quality seems to have its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me either. When I unpacked the rucksack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked is the color inside. Here you will find your things much faster than with a gray inner life. For someone who has other claims to a rucksack, the rucksack is definitely a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
I had liked E. L. Todd's Elektrik series best so far, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and I was really looking forward to the third part. part is all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily lengthy. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything to herself and then is like a small child in every argument and squirms?! there were also disagreements, my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor's Ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor would stand on him and tried to convince the Ex that Taylor couldn't do it without him and he heard it himself. at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. had hoped that this is the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out, that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more tension back into the story.
man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn! First of all: The film is not so bad now, as many write. Sure, of course the Story is totally constructed, and again and again conceived according to the same Schema F. If you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and appreciates nothing, and does not learn to do so! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often have I only thought about the film (and this even though I know that it is only a film, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals often already shoot tears in your eyes . therefore Jurassic World The fallen kingdom is already really neat. It's just a shame that humans just don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We consistently destroy animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: Misrepresentation. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Nevertheless well done PopcornKino.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some are expecting a movie at 8 Mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and it doesn't want to be. This film is above all "French" - moreover it is calm, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and expect nothing from it that it does not want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90s, because of Orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Inflation like never before! Diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Helpless, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, diarrhea has remained for 1 week. It should be noted that for the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, for the larger full 5 ? This is very very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair an intense shade into a chocolate brown in October, in February/March I used this hair dye remover. I have applied the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, there was an approximately chestnut brown (slightly darker) result. Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it one more time, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfactory. This evil was the queen of time-wasting! t made no difference, my hair looked like it did on the first try. worst of all, it still stunked weeks after use.. no matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just didn't go away.
Highly recommended
I now take the tablets for a longer period of time and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating healthy but also by taking vitamins D3 and K2 a little. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also super since you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
perfect function !!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems "connecting" with the cell phone over time. means that it is no longer loaded even though the "Power On/Off" Button has been pressed for 3 seconds. If you remove the cell phone from the case and put it back in, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. t are not many gross defects, but I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly in its function and that is why, for the cost of 30 €, I am very disappointed with the product, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months .
too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews come to Stande. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you get from every optician in a slightly smaller form as a gift. The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and no better. I promised myself a lot more of these Towels it is also really very very thin. I used it, unfortunately I can no longer exchange it I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these towels is far exaggerated more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. Basically the Onforu works great, it's waterproof (me shcon fell in the shower), it gives Bass like Bass again, Bluetooth works great... of course you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it comes loose.. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small loudspeaker. As I said, Bass is played back as Bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. while some frequencies of the vocals are already almost in the ears wehtun, higher and lower frequencies grade are well enough audible. My old speaker didn't play bass as well as bass, but the frequencies were presented quite naturally in volume. Unfortunately, that's not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. therefore I have to remove a star from it. I hardly expected the frequency response anymore.
very bad
In a few places the color had split off and if you just walked over it with your hand, the color went off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. they would only replace the damaged parts but as if both chests of drawers were damaged. Service from the manufacturer Amazon took care of all this for us and transferred the money back to us. A LOB to Amazon
to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are supplied which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no other protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't fault it, as I desperately needed this product. The supplied adhesive hardly lasts, but sticks well - like chewing gum, which does not harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together. The stencils are partially incompletely stamped. For single use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high quality product.
am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closure + Beautiful optics + Stable when set up + Shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors slam through Magnete (you can perhaps compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean spots
- the dowels supplied are much too small and wobble (I didn't have any others and I didn't have a trophy in the house either, glued with handicraft glue) - the holders for the inlay wobble a bit (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If it weren't so good looking and had such good measurements, I would give less stars, since you have to do everything right to be really satisfied. I also find it a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me....but
s there are only 3 Stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also significantly more expensive). ffern I would have forgiven 5*. unfortunately the coffee does not run evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (packed individually, see photo) also means a star drawer for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and collects the full score soon.
t me on the alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud. I couldn't put them down either. Probably a defect, supposedly it is possible. The slightest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fell out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hands. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. f then, however, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I found the colors and also the color change beautiful, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery so that in the event of a power failure the clock and wake-up time do not have to be re-entered. But he went back for the reasons mentioned.
Super light, insufficient processing
I replaced four lights in the house with these lamps. unfortunately I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead I laugh at this point a board on... s also lag nothing in the box. "6 pay - 4 receive" is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have settled this amicably and quickly, but I only found out after the return deadline. So I see it as my mistake and I live with it. nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these luminaries - so far the only reason for two-star deduction. The light itself is super. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly lit. The light color tends to go in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc. For living spaces, I would personally reach for warmer lights. comparable to a good old 100 Watt pear. However, other lamps can also do this and evtl I also get intact copies there according to the order. f my review is a help, I'm happy for a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Tolle
I have received Gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Already positive. I considered for a long time whether to order this set, or not. ** The material is stable and It sits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole in the handle to hang them **The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on coated pans. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **They also do not transmit the heat and can therefore be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But shortly after wiping and they are gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
-B-Ware as Neuware Sold
Amazon Prime shipping just top. Delivery within 24 hours. n the shock, unpack the faucet and check all the parts. Here we found that the part has already been used badly. On all assembly parts we have had to find significant scratches, abrasions. The screw connections/connections of the hoses were all damaged. nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the Verchromten faucet itself. This part has probably been delivered before and sent back again. We keep this faucet and build it into the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. r Conclusion; We never order such goods via Amazon again, but rather give a little more in the hardware store from where we get Neat Goods. it's just Traurig that customers are so scared!!!
The product itself is top, unfortunately the external sensor is already broken after 6 months
n principle I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very simple, and the radio range is also very good, although there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably there, because completely astronomical values of outdoor humidity are always displayed. This is a great pity, since the device was attached to a protected place on the outside and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
aside from the fact that the first attempt at the delivery stand today still happily drives around the republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with triggering a replacement delivery has been outstanding as always. The mower quickly arrived at me and made a good impression. The motor is strong and a nice sectional image results. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the big shortcoming is the catch basket. For one thing, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If it is only briefly set down, then it is naturally compressed and parts of the contents fall out. Worse, however, is that the actual practical level indicator shows red even when the catch basket is half full. t wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from now on. always emptying the basket on a large lawn when it is only half full cannot be the solution. So I cleaned the device as much as possible and sent it back. : Basically a very good mower, which due to the unfortunate construction of the catch basket becomes unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate via the app. The supplied plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but for battery protection only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons I give only 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be re-closed quite fumbled. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and put them back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D Printer, as I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to level the Hotbed properly to this day. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there and the front right screw almost falls out, since it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The poles that hold the cart are straight and so is the table. Maybe someone already knows what you can do, because that's how it's impossible to print something. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very exhausting. I have already written to Support but after a week of waiting I still haven't received an answer. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back. I expected a little more.
robust and precise bin positive surprised
Unfortunately, after many years, my old measuring slider gave up the spirit, so a new one was needed. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. There are two batteries with it, so that it can be placed directly. The packaging of the sliders is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full marks for it and believe it lasts at least as long as the old measuring slider. there is a clear buy recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor
I bought the bracelet and for the time being I haven't worn it as it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it has been constantly "ventilated". After return was no longer possible, I disposed of it. Rate from purchase to
For the price ok
Personally, the stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me, so it looks quite massive. The larger spheres are freely movable, which again I find quite nice. However, the whole chain is very easy to process, so I have already torn the closure twice. So far I have been able to fix it again and again, but I think that this will not go well/last long. But for the low price you can simply not expect anything really high quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through's Maul, it can't work out, amazing! I rubbed it in with some leather care, which makes it a little softer and more snug. : If you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after some gimmicks.... if you follow the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station again and inserted a new one, the transmitters have finally connected. unfortunately my joy about it did not last long, because after just an hour the connection was gone again, and that although the transmitters were next to the base station. The display of the three stations was also very different! All in all for me so useless! The thing went back! f a purchase in any case, it only brings trouble!
schaden
Hello, I have had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner shaft was rusted off. I bought them again for just one reason, I needed them urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line as well as the drain would fit. hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production fault and the current pump performs its services a little longer. unfortunately the new pump had a transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled carton. I kept the pump anyway, since as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
You could have thought through it better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought that such an organizer is more pleasant than running around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. In the beginning everything went quite well. However, the paint then faded quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this is also possible with a cent coin, but also only with a cent coin. I couldn't find a suitable slotted screwdriver that wouldn't have ruined the whole screw right away. To get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can set the screw to different sizes or lengths due to the different parts, but if you have screwed the whole thing first, you need pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. ng the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and dexterity. Ultimately, the screw broke off in the thread during the third time of mounting and thus the complete thing was unusable. : If at all then for just once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
do not quite correspond to the indicated measures
Lightweight zippers, the material looks robust and all in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first Organizer Set), I will only be able to actually assess the goods after the first use. I can say in advance that the height is lower than stated. m I can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. f necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before. t is also to be noted that not 8 but 10 parts were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag still contained two smaller pouches/bags. Not high quality processed, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of a different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.
lala
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now that I wanted to use it again, he didn't anymore. Battery?. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can.
is always good care! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound on my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. there were two black cables. The Akkus runtime is long enough. Definitively perfectly adequate Klang. I liked that the headphones don't hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Buy recommendation in this price range.
s chicks Dress
Very beautiful dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions.. Price-Leistung is in full agreement here, especially since I also bought it in the Blitzangebot. t in my size perfect, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was already recommended). I just wished that the neckline wasn't so deep, and that the sleeves could also handle a little more fabric (if you don't have upper arms quite as narrow as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Finger away. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously wouldn't have expected such a scrap to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a High End Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD works normally, Blu-rays are maximum unreliable detected. The discs have to be inserted several times, after that it makes Rödel noises like you haven't heard them since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because it is no longer working or the disc is finally barely recognized. But then you must not under any circumstances press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or even just anything. This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze. n addition, of course no Blu-ray Software is included. If you additionally purchase PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
t what it's supposed to be, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging any devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. actually needed a second port and had I only needed a sneaky extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought myself this shapeless lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not simply dangle around in the area, as with a normal extension cord. no real bad buy, but my Euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-).
but small oho! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) as well as connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters which I had to send back could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 Controller for BT on my tablet and the HDMI one on my TV. multaneous loading is not a problem. Tone is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation :P There is a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case it doesn't fit with the adapter. Naja also keeps so safe and has contact from that... Although all of them are a bit expensive, they are justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole is very small and stably manufactured in an aluminum piece. Performance price passt.
Lots of performance
Top device. It has been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet but delivers decent performance. I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) rather a bit too cool and I am therefore always on the road at level 2. It has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived well. And I also like the simple design. Competitors like to look bad like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but it does not make a favorable impression. The feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed in use. Overall I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weakness Akku
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in the live mode is the location to feel exactly 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters at a time, but this is not disturbing. I would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. ll he lasts about 1.5h days. Here would be a super solution which would create 7-14 days. There is an XL version, but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not have to last with us and we also find it impractical to change daily. One should deal with the dog not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They pass well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. ven though my son only wears the shoes in PE lessons, after just a few weeks the sole breaks and the shoes can no longer be used. In the last couple it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought for the lessons it will be enough. Unfortunately that was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Perfect pass - but Original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, no difference seems to be noticeable either, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly processed and the strap on the heel sits quite loosely and will very likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm excited!
d well
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am driving to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them with good luck. Included in the scope of delivery were the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and I really hope that it doesn't reappear. In the inflated state, a lying test was carried out directly. It sits well on it and is a great fit for the Festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but the one for days at the event is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. We took out the seats in the back. so passt is perfect. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is inserted into the cigarette lighter of the cars. However, the plug was defective (somewhat at the solder joint). s my friend is technically gifted, he was able to repair it and reassembled the good part worked excellently and pumped up the mattress in zero comma Nix. Overall I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm then really looking forward to the endurance test at the Festival. hope that it does not lose breath and also lasts a long time. Likewise, that he does not reappear mold. fter the test I can definitely recommend it. f I should have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately my calendar only gets two stars. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of toys. Unfortunately, the calendar was torn open over several doors by the lappy processing directly on Day 1. 21. On the little door there were more garkeine little doors and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly as they almost came to his liking. The parts often get messed up, which often means that you have to build the car apart again to get the parts on. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. Mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach.) I would no longer buy this calendar and would not recommend it to anyone else. The manufacturers may rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and do it better. :\
a real drone
I am enthusiastic about the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. Inside it flies very well and the 5 min. Flight time is usually completely sufficient. I didn't expect anything else at the price that the hair would get stuck in it and the drone would break very quickly, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are not a problem. If you have any questions, please contact us.
Game ok but only playable with Zwang to Steam. n the purchase I did not see that it is not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would still be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is an outrage. nce then the computer has been constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the games.
unfortunately it fails because of the battery life
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and Optics toll, messages etc. were displayed without any problems. the operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. Big catch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evenings, overnight only on the drm cupboard and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. a lot of news came during the day, the battery was already at the end at noon / early afternoon and then you can not even read the time anymore. therefore, not usable for me. It's a shame.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+ you should definitely buy a case. I recently liked cases in which you can also insert the credit card. This is what the shell offers here. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. She looks classy. In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded in the ringherum, only the terminals have recesses. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. t even on TORRO's leather QI charging station. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be charged when the case is off. notherwise really chic and well made!
high quality shell with armored glass film
Robust case with a real armored glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and is firmly attached to the phone. Overall a good buy.
