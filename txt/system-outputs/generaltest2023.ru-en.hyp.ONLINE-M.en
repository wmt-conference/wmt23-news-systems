The July issue is traditionally sold during the Moscow Film Festival, and it is, of course, very sad: to read the strips when the soul rages on Shabrol.
Nevertheless, we will tell about the MIFF next time (as long as I complain that this year in the consciousness of the organizers finally strengthened the inexplicable idea that happy holders of purchased tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite insulting principle, which no normal film festival in the world sins), and in this issue we are accountable for what we saw in Cannes. "Cinotaur".
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the main character of Robert Rodriguez's picture "The Predators", and inside the magazine try somehow not to miss the story about "The Beginning" Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), himself - without fools - the expected film of the summer.
And also this time we publish the first part of a fairly detailed guide on the creativity of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is certainly not necessary to advertise anything specifically, and it is clear that the author of "Suspicion" and "Ropes" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolay Karayev, Denis K Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaire Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hugh Olga Shakina, the London-born Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant record, was suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch whatever it took.
Caught in a corner, she'll turn into the black we're used to, and she'll go looking for the truth herself.
Another fighter with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal fight-girl promises to strengthen the position of the actress in the genre of action.
She will have one car accident after another, run along the walls of a la Matrix, and like children, throwing strong men in the same strict costumes.
That's how beauty is supposed to save the world.
Here he is, my dear, who blew up and fixed the world with the Fifth Element and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was his most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless incarnation of Evil.
And at the same time, it turned out not to be a boring blockbuster of the American type about saving humanity, but the sweetest living carnival.
What Besson did 13 years between "The Element..." and "Adele..." I don't want to remember.
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idly by, but all this script-producing fuss and rare, tortured directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." - hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems like 13 years before us, it wasn't our Besson, it was some doppelganger.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment on Montmartre, sipping wine in the café across the street, and writing a story about the most charming adventurer.
To retell the plot (even if it has its own features), heating up expectations, in this case it is sinful more than usual.
The whole incredible drive here is that at every turn or line, there are surprises waiting for you.
And all as one pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
THE UNUSUAL ADVENTURES OF ADELE
The funniest adventure movie of the decade hints that "Adele's Extraordinary Adventures" will begin as "Amelie", plunge towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comic books about journalist Adele Blan-Sec.
Louise Burguan had only starred in three films before Adele.
She became famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for the Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to appreciate special effects, sets or tricks, but enthralls himself, like an old-fashioned novelist, exclaiming before the great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: "Go, my reader, great things are waiting for us!"
At the same time, Besson treats the genre of cinema, about which he knows everything decisively, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who watched old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself cynicism and not shy of risk
DIRECTOR: Luke Besson
STARRING: Louise Burguzne, Mathieu Amalric, Frederick Bel, Gilles Lelouch
Story: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city has been ransacked by an ancient monster brought to life by an old medium.
The police are chasing after the fossil, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History and journalist Adele Blan-Sek, who is not so much concerned with the beast as with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
RELEASED JULY 22
"Adele..." is the case when a parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is capable of radically changing it, directing it on a new path.
So it was with the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, with the gangster fighters of Quentin Tarantino, with the mentioned "Indiana Jones" (he was both bowed and ridiculed here), finally with the same "Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film consists of verbal trickery, acting clowns and plot equilibrium (circus terms are quite appropriate - the union of the two arts here organically and firmly as never before).
I need to say a few words about Adele herself.
She embodies the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer, who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality as pure courage and courage.
In the movies, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of macho on duty or fluffy-eyed romantic.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer, who only spins under his feet (only his knowledge in zoology is useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, and has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, quite sloppy, Luke Besson showed an unexpected creative eagerness, reminding that the border between the preferences of bored visitors of megamolls and high-spirited art-house visitors is easily crossed by films for cheerful lunatics.
Adventure movie game without sadness, fear and reproach
DEATH ROOM
An airtight horror with a claim to psychology and political context Jonathan Libesman's 2002 debut horror film was criticized, but enjoyed the public and made a good profit, and most importantly caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
As a result, the young director found himself in a factory forging new horrors on old drugs: Bay set out to remake the entire horror classic and commissioned Libesman for the prequel to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2006).
Criticism crooked again, but the audience liked it again—Libesman worked in the spirit of the "new scary", emphasizing the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, on his example, one can observe how the whole genre is convulsing, trying to invent new ways of influencing a saturated audience: the naturalistic blood of the splatterers merges with the catch-up of the slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natalie's debut painting "The Cube". The film was made by Michael Bay.
So in Death Room, Libesman was forced to take a different path: a dull massacre or a monotonous run from a maniac, he preferred the smarter option – almost without the infamous bloodshed, but with a psychological game and riddles.
Evil doctors here are playing cat-and-mouse with their subjects.
And three men in a locked room trying to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from the outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only do they pass the test, but also a young ambitious employee of the secret services, which is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who has subdued in wild experiments.
PLOT: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given each a pile of leaves with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white robe enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
The game of survival begins, with government agents watching closely behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for horror, but not enough for outright arthouse
Might have a social conversation and run a fire extinguisher down his face, but he can't miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and adamant in her sympathies.
She is hurt by her father's courtly way of life and frankly eavesdropping as he dives into the pool for yet another romantic victim, as if parodying a famous scene from Paul Verhuven's "Shoogels".
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young chosen from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not the difference of generations or the choice of profession, it is, one way or another, already predetermined, and the unsuccessful attempts of the girl to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
The sluggish melodramatic Mger Mkrtchan together with Pavel Bardin made a comedy with Ivan Urgan "Three and a Snowflake".
The father of a grown-up daughter in the genre of comedy convincingly portrayed Depardier
The fragmentary plot loops around the love affairs of the heroes, who all the time talk about psychology, and themselves, apparently, by witty director's find, emphasize the language of gaze and gestures.
Secondary plot branches (the girl who was mutilated in a car accident, whom Alexey wants to marry, the athlete-drunk in the performance of Sergey Gorobchenko), alas, are only punctuated.
Especially sorry is the line about the business of bribery of football players, as well as the rest of the frame.
Plot: A football star sales agent is most concerned about the fate of his underage daughter Nasty.
The sad father himself changes women like expensive shirts, but the daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must definitely marry a guy "with a rod".
What is the disappointment of a businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and at the peak of his father, chooses his peer and business partner.
However, with a potential slogan for the film's audience, the author hit the "nine": "Don't look for a problem where it doesn't exist." You can't be more specific.
Their similarity is astonishing.
In both films there are troops of tough guys, soldiers of luck, forced to avenge those who set them up, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The characters jump around pretty much the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular footage - and there and there something stuffed with dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind of dollars descends on the scenery.
Even the villains dressed in expensive costumes are difficult to distinguish from each other (they are played in both cases by Patrick - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was as Natiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to film dance battles, "Brotherhood of Dance".
Chris Evans has recently been asked to play a character in other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by the comic book series that came out in the 1970s and was relaunched in the 2000s, while Joe Carnahan was inspired by the comedy series of the 1980s.
It is simply amazing how they, without collusion, brought different material to an absolutely identical thunderous denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary fighters, evoking in memory a mass of paintings with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out to be in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you choose between these two tapes, the Losers look a little nicer and clearly more winning in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least there's Zoe Saldana here who's really into bazooka.
Cast: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of mother commandos working for the CIA set up their own superiors: a helicopter with the children they were trying to rescue is blown up, and the soldiers themselves are now considered dead.
But they're alive, and they're determined to do whatever it takes to avenge the scoundrel with the dark voice who set this up.
It's all nice, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting is only worth it if you don't have any more interesting options.
Made from recycled raw materials, conditionally edible warfare
A simple story about an escaped Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international screening.
In principle, having only these data on hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, cinema promises to be highly social.
Of course, it will be realistic, but tough.
There is a high probability of participation of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the picture (yes, poverty knows no nationality, but Romanian poverty, as our festival winners prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of issue, you can easily take what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the countries of the Warsaw Pact, who in the early 80s read a lecture about Bresson
The film won the Grand Prix of the Jury at the Berlin IFF.
The script is based on the play by Andrea Valean, whose work is in particular demand among the directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Cinematographer Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboyu.
All this is true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - understand us correctly - is not at all abusive, but recommendatory: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development, when its representatives have faith in methods
has not yet wavered in her work.
And this moment must be seized: only thanks to this faith can one endure the spectacle of the Romanian juvenile colony for an hour and a half and give oneself to the charisma of the most talented Pisterean (whose history, despite the gulf separating the two cultures, can easily be
convert to exploitation a-la '70s, with a cowboy deciding to walk out of prison, from where he's about to get out, to the nearest saloon).
CAST: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condéescu, Mihai Konstantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
Synopsis: After turning four years old, 18-year-old Zec Silvio (Pistereanu) is about to be released, but suddenly learns that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From that moment on, the young man's behavior becomes inadequate.
An affair with Anna's social worker further pushes the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the picture.
What nonsense this is!
You want to watch, watch.
A good debut, inspiring little hope that the Romanian art house will someday grow a decent direction
Cartoon about the joys of cruelty and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grobe (Sop) and his co-writer Renault was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandry, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, among others, for all "Glacial Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
“Ugly Me” is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to look at it in the ZO), especially if you like when different objects from time to time bounce from the screen into the hall), it is bearably written, and, most importantly, there are no lower waist jokes, because of which during the “Glacial Ages” had to shyly squeeze into the chair and close the children’s ears with their hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the sense of moderation of the authors, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn is dictated by the unwillingness to touch in any way the subject of paedophilia.
The "adult" part here, apart from the main conflict of lone fatherhood, is responsible for a rather harsh dark humor (which, one wants to think, we owe to the director Coffin).
Overall, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought out every detail to make the film appealing to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see children's cartoon characters get eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion.
The Nose-nosed villain Grew, whose childhood dreams of space travel have been transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the Moon, is forced to enlist the help of children to execute a grand plan and eliminate a young competitor.
At an advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans: Margot wearing glasses, Edith wearing a hat, and Agnes, who has a killer degree of affection comparable only to a Shrek cat.
As it usually happens, children change the plans of adults.
The main character is portrayed by Christopher Meledandry - both bald, nosy and prone to dark humor.
The original cast was voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Siegel.
In the finale, Grew dances the Travolta party.
To an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of the conventional desert, a car rolls up, out of which come three pairs of kindest tits.
Exactly so.
In themselves, the bearers of this gift are not so significant.
The camera's focused on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs we immediately report the good news - the whole film is made in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things about women's beauty and casts such that what happens on the screen is of secondary importance.
And there's a lot of funny stuff going on.
"Broker", "Killer" and "Stripper" dig in the sand, pour water (don't ask why), carry some kind of pork and periodically fight quite often.
The creators think a maternity chick with generous shapes, smeared in dirt, with a broken nose and shiny white teeth is cool.
"Virgin Stuff" is primarily focused on classic sex tape.
Rick Jacobson directed the episodes "Zena - Queen of Warriors" and "The Wonderful Journeys of Hercules".
A similar film in the spirit of the Moscow rental is "The Barrel for Jennifer".
What's more, when a slutty beauty twists the balls of a bandit, a fucked-up punk fights with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex, and the intrigue is unleashed through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for the film fetishist there is a real Klondike of pleasures.
Of course, Jacobson and his crew were having a great time filming this thrash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it wasn't for the physicals of the actresses, it'd be boring by the middle.
We can assume that this game came to us from the adult night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
STARRING: Julia Vo, Erin Cummings, America Olive, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring to the desert a mafia boss, who somewhere here hidden diamonds for a substantial amount.
Having achieved nothing and shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to quarrel, fight with each other and periodically arriving scumbags from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and cuddle.
As the case progresses, it turns out that the three are not who they were originally supposed to be.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even more fun.
Product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous nonsense
Yes, with his latest picture, Judgment Day, an exasperated Mad Max for the poor, Marshall gave a serious twist.
Bloodthirsty and biting ashes restore the director's shattered trust.
The new non-politically correct and grim magnum opus does not shy away from a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious cinema aesthetics of category "B".
There is in the picture both the hooligan courage of the War Dogs, and the beastly cruelty of the Despo.
Marshall's plan to clean up the peplum from the sticky post-gladiatorial filmmaking filmmaking has generally worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the Ninth Legion's history.
His battle-scarred legionaries (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough men trying to marry their military duty with an insurmountable desire to survive.
Murder and the piquant details of the dispatch of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and circumstance.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which cost a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the introductory handout in the German woods of the now standard "Gladiator" Sir Ridley Scott, but trying to accuse Marshall of plagiarism for some reason absolutely does not want to: he works honestly and without pretensions.
STARRING: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurilenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
Plot: The lands of modern Scotland occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost, where the centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is serving, is mercilessly crushed by the Picts.
Miraculously rescued, Dias is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, along with a bunch of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadist Itain (Kurilenko).
The subtle arthouse artist has so far managed to win back only the sharp character roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after "Centurion" the situation will change.
Peplum -— edition corrected and supplemented.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and harsher
A sequel to the story of schoolgirl Bella (Christen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young men: the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lottner).
Pattinson fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the cartoon series about a bald boy-sorcerer, called to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The Fire Lord waged a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will only be able to stop him if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) knows how to steal people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
By penetrating the subject's sleep, it makes the sleeping brain work according to its own rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite - leave in one head what wasn't there.
A picturesque lesson on managing illusory worlds by Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicholas Cage) finds himself a young assistant in hopes of defeating the evil wizard (Alfred Molina).
Using destructive spells, they'll cause trouble in the middle of Manhattan with dragons and explosions.
Bald as a billiard ball, Kisa has set out to take over the world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second episode of a fluffy family comedy.
A number of tanned thugs led by the flimsy-looking Royce (Adrien Brody) mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where they are hunted by stylish fangled aliens.
The return of the cult character of the 80s to the big screen.
Note George Clooney, who teamed up with rock-photographer-now-director Anton Corbine (“Control”) for a highly intriguing existential study of the psychology of an aging assassin hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly grasping human nature.
"The visionary artist of the scale of Corbine and the magnificent George Clooney is a film union concluded in the heavens," the studio press release boasts.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in the life of Clooney - with Italy: shooting took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel The Very Secret Gentleman, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the English narrator was replaced by an American, and the protagonist was transformed from an illegal gunsmith into a murderer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to figure out his last case and finally quit the lucrative trade, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tecla Ruthen), with whom Clooney instantly falls in love.
"Jack tempts fate," says the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be who he claims to be."
Judging from the trailer, Corbain's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashes (the film is similar to the long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe to star in Remark's film adaptation of "On the Western Front Without Change"
And can I click you from the photo gun!?
Johnny Depp was seen in two places at once this season.
First, in Venice, on the set of Florian Henkel von Donnersmark's thriller "The Tourist" ("Life of Others").
There, he plays a tourist in love with the heroine Angelina Jolie.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, at the Rome Diary, the filming of the legendary Hunter S. Thompson's debut novel.
The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson (Whitney and Me), whose last directing work was the 1992 thriller Jennifer 8.
Looking at the work of the posters of the domestic prison drama, one can not even doubt what inspired them.
But you can't approach the question of implementing an idea literally!
However, it is good that the heroine of the Russian painting is a stranger, but not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects: "Lucky Gilmore", "Big Dad", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't Joke with Gohan!"
A fifth comedy, Classmates, was released in July, and a sixth comedy, Pretending Wife, starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
There is also a seventh film, the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, in which Sandler will play Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughn, remembered by the audience this year as the enchanting fighter "Pipetz", will take over the reboot of the X-Men.
In X-Men: First Class, the director first enlisted James McAvoy as the young Professor X-Men.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepathic Emma Frost, nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Herd will reincarnate into the blue-skinned Mystic, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While filming of the new Bondiana series is delayed, its new director, Sam Méndez, is never bored.
On his to-do list are the musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the film adaptation of the novel By the Shore by Isaac McEusne.
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Cary Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman examines the role of practical Major George Smiley, the protagonist of the John Le Carre series of novels, in the film adaptation of the thriller Spy Come Out!.
The first adaptation of this piece was played by Alec Guinness in 1979.
The new version will be filmed by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film Let Me In.
Tom Tucker is adapting David Mitchell's best-selling fantasy novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, it is not easy (the novel has six parallel story lines), but extremely interesting work.
He has already made offers to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
In Crimea, shooting of international militant Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune".
It's dedicated to millionaires who went for their money to a real war in search of adrenaline.
The roles are occupied by Christian Slater, Sean Been, Wing Rames, Dominic Monagan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The film is scheduled to premiere in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy "Baby Jesus" along with English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox fired from Transformers 3
According to the film company Ragatoipe, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler".
However, the role of the main character and new beloved hero Shaya LaBafa is likely to be taken by English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley.
The girl doesn't have any film experience, so she's going to take accelerated acting classes.
This fact should not scare the experienced viewer - in the history of cinema there are a lot of examples of successful re-qualification of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron (“Monster”), Angelina Jolie (“Life Interrupted”), Jessica Lang (“Blue Sky”, “Tutsi”), Kim Basinger (“Secrets of Los Angeles”), Jennifer Connelly (“Mind Games”), Gina Davis (“Random Tourist”) and “First Vice Miss USA-86” Halle Berry (“Monster Ball”) began as modelers filmed for fashion magazines, eventually winning the well-deserved "Oscar".
Excelled in acting (also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Belucci and, what is especially nice, our compatriot Olga Kurilenko.
High rewards are clearly at arm's length.
In a nutshell, Rosie has someone to learn from.
Valeria Guy Germanika, who earned the Cannes Jury Special Mention in 2008 for her film “Everybody will die, but I will stay” and directed the scandalous TV series “School”, has been appointed creative director at the TV channel MT.
The management of the channel believes that Valeria will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanica also started casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into "Vykrutasy".
The main theme of the film remained the same - the provincial Russian teacher Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) hurries to Moscow to his bride, but is delayed to train the football team of the homeless.
A new development was given to the second storyline of the painting.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina the role of the capital bride Nadi will be played by Milla Jovovic.
As an additional intrigue will appear a third - ex-fiancé of Nadia Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, apart from the question of whether the field team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma as to who will win Milla Jovovic.
Due to the constant delays in filming The Hobbit and the presence of a mass of outside projects, Guillermo del Toro gave up the position of director.
The studios persuade producer Peter Jackson to take the matter entirely into his own hands, but he is willing to accept the move only if absolutely necessary.
Possible successors include David Yates, who completed the filming of the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Fascinated by the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers at high speeds wandered between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Pearl Hotel, where press conferences and round tables flowed, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The characters of the competition films behaved under the name - almost everyone someone ran somewhere: confused Asians from "Gastarbiter" Yusup Razikov and "The Other Sky" Dmitry Mamuliya were looking for the missing grandson and wife, a runaway bandit from the painting "Live" by Yuri Bykov
The same men were happily wrapped around the finger by Detective Klim Shipenko's hero "Who am I?" - who, however, was remembered by the audience rather by the presence in the frame of totally nude Jeanne Frisk.
Heroes of the domestic show business appeared and in a couple of competition pictures - in the film "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played the lorry driver, driving a circus animal to the slaughter, and Yevgeny Grishkovets reasoned on favorite themes - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film production for two "Satisfaction", where the business party They called each other to an alcohol duel over a lady.
However, the business events at the "Kinotaura" carried a tangible imprint of the show - it was not boring at any of them.
At a round table devoted to the fate of the Russian art house, Sergei Tolstikov, chairman of the Foundation for Support of Russian Cinema, arranged a picturesque confrontation with critics: "Do you read articles in the press that I read?" he asked the audience terribly.
“I write them,” the President of ERVESZ answered confusedly! Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko’s film “Oatsyanka” was suddenly taken from the competition program - he will go to Venice: Mostra’s selectors decided that unnecessary Russian screening would interfere with them.
Previously, "Kinotavr" did not interfere with the giants - in Sochi many times the films of major festivals were shown: this time, let's say, the film of Sergei Loznitsa "My Happiness", which competed with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun on the Azure Beret, participated in the competition.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of the former Cannes competitor and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, did not like Loznica's picture at all - but under pressure from colleagues he was forced to give her the prize for directing.
The award for the best debut – “The Missing One” – was given to the daughter
Horrible film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to monstrous acts without any visible goal.
A well-staged, purifying film-experience shot by a math-educated misanthrope who calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutante with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls the films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the joy of the viewer lies in the effort to understand his inaccessible meditative films.
The most complex picture “Kinotavura” has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition – the director’s star was born.
The impeccably dressed and groomed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained pretentiousness, hiding in the lair of neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, an unjust hand of the punitive authorities on the head of the hero, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkian spaces and situations.
“Sometimes it is useful to work not only with debutantes,” producer Sabina Yeremeeva said solemnly from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics disagreed: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull an "internal debutant" out of the domestic art-cinema cage.
And this is symptomatic - in our cinema these days, the zoners are moving after the youth.
Not the other way around.
Documentary film, shot in such a way that the head blows cleanly off than from similar fiction.
The author is interested in both a screwdriver exploring an electric meter and a piece of unsalted cream floating on a cast-iron pan—all of which turn the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-tooth lover and her criminal-brother into a real doc-canvas oil.
The winner of the short meter competition Nikolay Sokolov tries the black and white stylistics of the French new wave on the world of sleeping areas.
Even though the Raraov editing moves in the story of two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, may seem strange, but thank you for the rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the type An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 take to the sky, equipped for the duration of the work with meteorological equipment and technical means of impact on clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological pyropatrons with silver iodine and powdered reagents.
The process looks like this: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break” with these reagents clouds going to the city. The particles of matter condense the moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned and precisely where the cloud was impacted."
For ten years, work has been underway on a remake of a science fiction film starring Michael York.
The director was recently appointed Karl Rinsch (he already has a remake of The Beasts of the Black Lagoon in his schedule), who is famous for his commercials.
Previously associated with the project were Brian Singer ("X-Men"), James McTig ("V" stands for Vendetta), and Joseph Kosinski ("Tron: Legacy").
In the plot, the hero, who turned thirty, is forced to escape the death penalty, as the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching that age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a rotoscopic fantasy cartoon of the 1980s and plans to make it into a large-scale film.
The original was the joint work of director Ralph Bakshi (m/f The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of drawn boobs.
In it, Warrior Larn saves Princess Tiger and all the people from the evil ice lord Necron.
Rodriguez promises to be careful about creating Inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the near future, as 1 himself plans to do a remake of the classic jallo painting Dario Argento.
On the wide screens the heroes will return none other than Michael Bay - the ruler of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damin Chen, who will adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and together filmed "Two Evil Looks" in 1990.
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing it.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Noltey to join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur"
“I wanted to bring more power to the feminine character to reflect the state of things in China,” Chen says.
Chinese women now run big business and win Olympic gold.
Gong Lee embodies this power."
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
Is that an accident?
Regularity.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I present here (at the "Kinotavra" and Sochi Film Market - EMRBE) two pictures.
And I play the dream woman in both.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he introduced me, and a lot of people probably think that's who I am in life.
Dream girl.
Your film partner Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his hero.
How did you find common ground? What's he like on the set?
He's absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
First I saw him, and I thought, "Yeah... I don't just have to."
I guess without human contact, genuine and real, we wouldn't have done anything.
And this contact happened literally minutes after we met.
We're great, I'm not afraid of that word, made friends.
I told him all my fears, all my worries, that I was afraid that I would fail, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he was happy to give me that advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do it because I was so afraid of losing that connection, of losing our understanding.
And so at the premiere, we watched the whole film holding hands.
How was the shooting in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I never toured there, I never went there on holiday, I never went there as a child.
This town has a special magic, a character, a charisma.
And this is the city I want to go back to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always catches up.
So it wasn't hard for you to play in love with this town.
In fact, you are extremely organic on screen, which a lot of people, frankly, didn't expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are you easily given emotional scenes?
You know, I'm an unprofessional actor.
And I'm a very, by nature, trusting person.
If I came in and agreed to work with a director, then I'm actually putting myself in his hands and I want to be a test to be made out of.
I understand perfectly well that from the outside, and I, again, ask for hints and talk to the director, for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, in long hours of rehearsal, we come to the organ you're talking about.
And how did you work with the director of the painting, Klim Schipenko?
I was stoned by everyone, cameraman, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I enjoy working with crazy people!
That's what I saw when I was working with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was prepared not to sleep, not to eat - and that was exactly the situation here.
Not sleeping, not eating for 24 hours - and still, at least thunder, at least hail.
And if something went wrong, it was a disaster, and something must be done urgently to make it happen.
It's very easy to work in this crazy atmosphere.
And it seems to me that when people are so moved to a painful bigotry about what they're doing, it can't fail, because it takes too much energy.
What scenarios do you reject?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want nonsense, silly dialogues, films that say nothing, carry nothing.
I don't want to work just to be on screen again.
Do you have any suggestions, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no concrete proposals or plans at the moment.
I'm not the kind of guy who makes the charts.
The script came in, it got me interested, it premiered today.

PUBLICITY BOOTH
While we are working on the November issue, there are almost uninterrupted film festivals in Moscow: American film - "Amfest", "2toggo", "2-t-1", followed by the British film festival.
And here's the interesting thing: half of the people they know are constantly discussing that someone needs to be boycotted and someone needs to be supported, for some -- well, excuse me -- very vague reasons.
At the same time, when one of these festivals solemnly closes with a horrifying view of Chu4 projection without English subtitles, nobody kind of notices anything.
The least I want to moan about this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall to look at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then you will be shown them.
Meanwhile, we don't have any pixels inside: "Tron: Legacy" (a continuation of the classic picture about virtual reality), "Let me in. Saga (an American remake of a beautiful Swedish film), Unmanaged (another Tony Scott approach to the subject of trains) and a wildly detailed account of how films about Conan, the barbarian, the destroyer and the governor were made.

SOCIAL NETWORK
History of creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first and foremost, a story of paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools of the Internet that united the world, divided five friends and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire in decades.
Jesse Eisenberg is as brilliant as our conflict genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a number of reasons: partly because of anger at the outside world, partly because of sports interest and partly simply because IT is "cool".
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of the Social Network become apparent from the first shots, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking to his five-minute ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): the loud, harsh dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength already here and do not soften until the very end.
The same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (With the exception of the Winklevoss Twins, the cast was played by different actors.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other with the help of computer graphics.
Natalie Portman attended Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara landed the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR David Fincher
Cast: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Hermie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: Gloomy and closed-minded Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a personal turn from the gate, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook’s popularity grows, relationships with a few companions begin to crumble and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the dark, it maneuvered between two tangled chains of events and two separate lawsuits.
Outside of the stream of incessant debate, there is not much going on in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, not even all of Zuckerberg's legal ramblings are unlikely to draw even an extra paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this not very generous story?
After viewing, there is a persistent feeling that the “Social Network” is a portrait of our time, and the unspeakability in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing about the same thing, only on a larger scale - with the cosmic ego and big business.
Now that the daily solvency has become even higher, policy is no longer implemented in board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, wants to be the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now has no one to play with.
The Winklewosses (Hummer and Pence), meanwhile, are stomping their feet: who said that the rich, the handsome, and the athletic can't be smart?
(This line especially amuses Fincher.)
If desired, the “Social Network” could well turn into a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what's more positive or negative about his business?
And what social consequences would his invention entail?
He's a scammer?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close a book if there's even the slightest hint of something like this.
But it won't even be necessary here: in their version of history, it doesn't matter at all.
“What does it feel like to feel beautiful?” asks Tre VeaNez’s song “VaBu Wots’te A Vsp Map”, which precedes the titles.
The hero doesn't know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a poor idea of beauty and even less - of feelings.
Tastefully made character drama about the high-profile trial of the Internet era
At the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames among people of unknown origin did not begin to appear.
We used to call him "such, such a son."
I mean, there were patronymics, nicknames after my father.
But sometimes, for example in the case of the father's remarriage, the matronym was used - a nickname after the mother's name.
Susanin is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna."
The serfs of small landowners really did not have surnames for a long time - why she when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants names.
So, the fortress princes of Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the XVIII century. had surnames all over.
In the nineteenth century, even small landowners did not keep the man on the land, but let him earn a living by craft and pay the landlord.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport in which he had to write his surname.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of the serfs were released for bondage.
Which means they already had names.
Capital forensic investigators flew to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Forensic scientists of the central apparatus and employees of the forensic expert center came to Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the case of the gas explosion in the house at 39 Lineina, NGS reports.
According to the investigation, the defendants, Irina Urbach and Evgeniy Kavun, presenting themselves as employees of the fictional organization "Mezhregiongaz", examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked carelessly, and the prices for their services, on the contrary, inflated, the agency reports with reference to an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineina, a man and a woman visited three apartments of building No. 39, where they changed the hose plates.
So, in one of the apartments, they put a water hose instead of a gas hose.
Kavun, however, denies it.
According to him, it's impossible, everything has been certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture in one of the apartments leaked and exploded.
Two entrances collapsed, one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, resulting in the deaths of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the bombing of a house in Novosibirsk.
The fraudsters themselves came from Omsk.
St. Petersburg managed to avoid sea drift flooding
Arguments of the Week.

Specialists were able to prevent flooding thanks to the closure of the dam the day before.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
Sea drift flooding was prevented by the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could become the 32nd in number, the St. Petersburg edition Neva reports.There.
The water level reached 184 centimetres, but the closing of the seals in the Gulf of Finland kept the water level at 168 centimetres, which is only 7 centimetres above the lower threshold for dangerous flooding (161 to 210 centimetres).
The weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, sometimes reaching 20-25 metres per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again navigate the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland monitor the situation with the water level.
This prevents flooding, which may follow increased winds.
In Turkey 8 people arrested for malfunctions in collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Shanlyurfa, eight people were arrested for building defects found in buildings collapsed as a result of the earthquake.

The number of wounded exceeds 80,000.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude quake was followed by hundreds of underground shocks that were felt not only in Turkey's 10 provinces but also in neighboring Syria.

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, on Friday, an air bomb exploded during the Second World War, which the deminers tried to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard from tens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began to defuse it.
Luckily, the entire force is intact.
Agencies have begun to assess the damage," Norfolk Police Assistant Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write on social media that the blast shook homes at a distance of 24 km.

Photo caption: The explosion happened against the plans of the deminers, but did not kill or injure
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at its mouth on the North Sea shore of Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, deminers built a sand barrier around the bomb and erected a barrier to intruders at a distance of 200 metres.
At first, on Thursday, the explosives technicians were going to use a robot to cut the fuse from the bomb, but the attempt was unsuccessful, and then they decided, according to the local press, to use the technique of "slow burning" explosives.
In the process of this burning, an explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941 alone, known as the "Blitz", 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Almost 40% of Belarusian researchers are women
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, said Alesya Solovyi, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The proportion of women among PhDs and PhDs is also increasing: 41.1 per cent of PhDs and 21 per cent of PhDs are women.
In all fields of science except technology, the proportion of women exceeded 50 per cent.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, where women account for 64.4 per cent.
In technical sciences alone, men predominate, with women accounting for 26.7 per cent.
At the National Academy of Sciences, women account for 49.1 per cent of researchers, which is 10.2 per cent more than in the country as a whole.
Women account for 46 per cent of candidates of science and 20 per cent of doctors of science.
More than half (57 per cent) of the teaching staff at higher education institutions are women.
One in three vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work (31.8 per cent), 38.7 per cent of deans, 44.6 per cent of deputy deans and 42.5 per cent of department heads.
The majority of senior teachers and teachers are women, at over 60 per cent.
There is also a high proportion of women among associate professors (55.2 per cent).
According to the republican monitoring of public opinion conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about the opportunities of women in science.
63.5 per cent (56.5 per cent of men and 69 per cent of women) disagree to some extent with the gender stereotype of “science is a male activity”.
More than half of the population do not believe that women are less competent as scientists - 66.1 per cent (59 per cent of men and 71.6 per cent of women).
"Transformation in the mass consciousness of gender notions about women's research competence contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, forming a successful role model of a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," said Alesya Solovyi.
The International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated annually on 11 February.
The festival was established to introduce women and girls to science, encourage women to pursue scientific careers and recognize women ' s achievements in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30 per cent of the world ' s researchers.-0-
The probability of further increase of the key rate is higher than its decrease
Such a statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina after the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep the rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that recently there have been important changes.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have deteriorated noticeably - the prices of Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the economic situation is better than the October forecast.
The shift in demand continues, with consumption remaining subdued, private investment slowing, but fiscal spending rising.
At the same time, inflationary risks have broadly increased.
"Therefore, in the current year, the probability of a rate increase exceeds the probability of a rate decrease.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation", - said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, fast-paced consumption in the face of elevated inflation expectations, if the factors that constrain consumption activity weaken.
Second, there is a growing shortage of labour and productivity growth lagging behind wage growth.
The risks of further tightening of sanctions restrictions also remain.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher key rate trajectory than expected in October.
In the updated ECB forecast for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate are increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% p.a. for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% p.a. for 2024.
"This does not exclude the possibility of lowering the rate this year, but its probability and scope have decreased.
On the contrary, the likelihood that some rate hike may be needed to bring inflation close to 4% in 2024," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for the creation of special closed-end mutual funds (FIFs) consisting of frozen foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such papers will be removed from the existing retail PIFs.
This will enable the management of the remaining liquid assets to be started and investment unit operations to resume.
If the retail PIF contains more than 10% of the blocked securities, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed PIF by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the principal fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with a share of frozen securities less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the frozen assets to a separate closed PIF.
In addition, there is a requirement to inform shareholders of the consequences of the withdrawal of frozen securities to a special PIF.
In the future, in the case of the sale of such securities, the management companies are obliged to pay the owners of investment units at least 90% of the proceeds quarterly, the statement of the Bank of Russia says.
In addition to summarizing the industry, experts gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analysis and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia air transport passenger turnover decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transport - by 14.2%.
Passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people and passenger turnover - 228.0 billion passenger-kilometres.
International passenger transport amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, domestic transport - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
Analysts of PSB note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by the program of state support.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could get a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rosturizm.
Also, to ensure the accessibility of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidies for transportation of citizens, development of regional transportation, etc. with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to recapitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidies to the industry (so far, 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated), in 2023 passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, to 103.0 million people", - share the forecast PSB analysts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, death of 6-year-old child
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were killed in a terrorist attack in Jerusalem when a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Six other people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot at the scene.
It was later revealed that he was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions have been classified by law enforcement agencies as a terrorist act, the terrorist's relatives have been detained and the house has been sealed.
However, according to Israeli media reports, the assailant had mental problems and was released from the hospital only this week.
Austria is once again tightening controls at the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people remain at the border in cars waiting to cross it to the Austrian side.
It thus sends a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already passed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
On the basis of existing arrangements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request has been made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities considered it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants fell victim to smugglers and ended up between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
This is why, in the view of the police, more control is needed.
Vienna’s decision to tighten checks followed a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the Commonwealth’s borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status for the first time exceeded the figures of 2016 and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
Cargo "Progress 83" successfully docked with ISS
The automatic replenishment vehicle Progress 83 successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3.45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.

The docking was broadcast by NASA Flight Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists of the Flight Control Center.
Astronauts Sergey Prokopiev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina welcomed the cargo ship from the ISS.
Progress MS-22 delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian astronauts.
"Progress 83" successfully launched from the Russian Cosmodrome "Baikonur" on Thursday.
At the same time, Roskosmos reported that Progress MS-21 was unsealed, prepared for disconnection from ISS and further flooding on February 18.
According to the press service of the company, the passage hatch of the ship was immediately closed: "Progress MS-21" is isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its release are being clarified.”

How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Argentine Migration Service began suspending and revoking the residence permit of Russians who had obtained it through the birth of a child but had not remained in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic refused entry to the country to several pregnant Russian women, who were suspected of having arrived with the purpose of "maternity tourism".
On 11 February, they were admitted to Argentina by a court order.
More details - in the material "Newspapers.Ru."
The Argentine Migration Service began suspending and revoking the residence permit (Residence Permit) of Russians who received it through the birth of a child but did not remain in the country.
The director of the service Florence Carignano told C5N.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permit of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentine, but at the same time spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country), " - she explained.
According to her, when the court will consider the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came again."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of the child and left may withdraw it.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at an airport in Argentina because they were denied entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Argentina Georgiy Paulin, the diplomatic mission connects the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic may have considered the information provided by the girls upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more on the evening of February 8, reports RIA Novosti.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women arrived in Argentina, but specifically these three were issued a restraining order.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the law on migration, where one of the reasons for not being allowed into the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Paulin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine migration service allowed pregnant Russian citizens to enter the country by court decision, lawyer Christian Rubilar said.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the Migration Service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the Republic.
It allows short-term travel to 171 countries without visas, including the EU states, the UK and Japan, notes RBC.
In early January 2023, The Guardian reported a "boom of maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Paulin, in 2022 from 2,000 to 2,500 citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are going to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number may grow to 10,000," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that in 2022 about 10,500 Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5,800 pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how prices for renting housing in St. Petersburg have changed.
She's down 10%.
At the same time, it is known that throughout the country rent has become more expensive by 25%, reports Patrol Saint Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
One-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, studio - 22,000 rubles per month, two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country had become known.
The Argentine migration service refused to allow six pregnant Russian women to enter the country, as the purpose of the visit they had indicated was false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the TV channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them confessed that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
As a result, representatives of the country prevented Russian women from entering Argentina.
As clarified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure of action if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is in the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she can not clearly tell where she will go to rest, then suspicions from the migration service immediately fall on her.
Moreover, experts specify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".

Kirkorov won the trial against the fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed the illegality of the artist's construction, but did not attend the hearing.
Rybak sued musician Philip Kirkorov for allegedly illegally installed pier at his Moscow country house.
That's what Channel Five says.
However, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsov City Court. According to the lawyer, the court was presented with documents, design projects, which confirmed the legality of all buildings installed on the territory of the house of celebrity.
As the head of the law firm Alexander Dobrovinskoyi clarifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff a chance to go fishing.
The application for the executor was filed on 11 January.
The star lawyer jokingly said that probably the man planned to fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky specified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He stressed that from there there is an opportunity to throw spinning further.
Somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Doctor-somnologist Sofia Cherkasova told about food and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As noted by the specialist, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
These are primarily tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, because they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "torn", and therefore do not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, the use of caffeine-containing products is better to stop 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, there are difficulties with falling asleep.
Negatively affects the ability to fall asleep and alcohol.
The doctor specifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts greater than 36 grams of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as shallow sleep and frequent nighttime awakening.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends abandoning spicy food of voluminous portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in the internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For a healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the optimal is the air temperature of 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not necessary to abuse heavy food before sleep, because it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and habitual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to the regime of sleep and rest and allow the body to recover.

Roskosmos executive director for manned space programs Sergey Krikalev commented on the situation.
"On the cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months, there has been a heat leak from the thermal control system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened with our ship ("Soyuz MS-22" - TASS) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with the "Soyuz" came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to make sure there are no problems at the next launches.
"We need to do an in-depth analysis to make sure that this reason does not extend to similar designs on future launches.
This is the most important task that will be facing us now," he said.
According to the Executive Director, an analysis has to be carried out in terms of the preparation of the ship for launch, the materials that were used and the technologies that were used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some systematic mistake," Krikalev added.
The Executive Director clarified that on Saturday the commission began its work, which will conduct an analysis of all possible causes.
"The ship was supposed to be disconnected and dropped from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz ship ("Soyuz MS-23" - note. TASS), so serious consequences on the actions of the crew, on the work of the crew... This will not affect the program from this point of view," Krikalev said.
The Progress MS-21 truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on 26 October.

Deputy Director of the Russian Railways proposed to the Governor of the Irkutsk region to develop new sales directions
Irkutsk region needs to continue to develop alternative marketing directions, except for the Far East.
This is both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
Alexey Shilo, Deputy Director of the Russian Railways, made such a proposal at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reports on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year showed, even in spite of the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of the companies constantly interact with our "intermediaries" (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal price conditions for the transportation of their products according to new schemes, - Alexey Shilo stressed.
The Governor noted the importance of the stability of the shipment of products, the Irkutsk region is one of the richest in mineral resources of the regions of the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
There are about 25 coal-mining enterprises in the region.
The instability of export shipments has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal-mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures stable operation of such enterprises.
- Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to support the volume of traffic.
If there are additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market, we are also ready to assist in this direction, - said Alexey Shilo.

The cost of all works - more than 80 million rubles.
Repair is in the final stage, problems with connection to power grids - need to increase capacity, work with the power supply organization is underway.
In addition, in Granovshia and Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom the developers sold illegally connected to the electrical networks houses.
It was decided that the network company would arrange a personal reception next week for the legal settlement of these issues.
- Very often the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population increasingly uses electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes voluntarily connect homes to nearby grids, and this is already the reason for disconnecting the electricity supply.
Therefore, network companies in those territories where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, - Konstantin Zaitsev stressed.

Armenian-Turkish border crossing opened for delivery of humanitarian aid for the first time in decades
The Margara-Alyijan border crossing point on the Turkish-Armenian border was opened for the first time in three decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
Turkish and Armenian media reported this.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, according to Turkish news agency Anadolu.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency packages to the city of Adyaman in southern Turkey, Ankara’s special representative at the Armenian-Turkish talks Serdar Kylic said.
He expressed gratitude to the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Armenia Ruben Rubinyan and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vaan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help sent by the Armenian people to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-stricken region," Kylych wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vaan Unanyan said that trucks with humanitarian aid have crossed the border through the Margara Bridge and are heading to the earthquake-stricken region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margar Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
Turkish news agency Anadolu cites other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border post was last used to deliver humanitarian goods to Armenia to deal with the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
At that time, aid collected by the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria in the earthquake-affected areas.
According to the latest figures, more than 25,000 people have died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that happened on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan reported on February 11 that 21,848 people have been killed in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are marred mainly by Ankara's refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, as well as its support for Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Yerevan and Ankara have recently made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial air services between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year hiatus.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for third-country nationals as soon as possible.

"Now you can cast a bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake and will be remembered by most people not as a footballer, but as a footballer-offender.
But he's still a long way from Cocorin.
Because no one could screw up their potential the way Cocorin did.
Mamayev, with all his talents, was periodically noticed.
I can only wish him luck and realize himself somewhere else," - quotes Gubernieva Metaratings.ru.

In the port of Spain were not allowed a tanker with diesel from previously under the Russian flag ship
The Tarragona Naval Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Navy under the Ministry of Transport of Spain banned the entry of the ship Maersk Magellan to unload diesel fuel, because the cargo comes from the ship Nobel, which until July 1, 2022 was under the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Tarragona Naval Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development prohibited entry into the port of Tarragona for the unloading of diesel fuel on the vessel "Maersk Magellan" under the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it carries comes from a vessel under the Cameroonian flag "Nobel", which until July 1, 2022 was under the flag of Russia," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with EU law, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag since 16 April 2022 or that changed flag after 24 February 2022.
The Ministry clarified that the verification was carried out on 9 February, after which a ban was agreed.
The Ministry reminded that this is not the first case when ships are prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Maltese-flagged Black Star, which was carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel, was denied access to the port of Barcelona.
In 2022, following the intensification of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, the US and the UK imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian oil products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.

Pregnant Russian women problems with entry to Argentina explained
According to the expert, against the background of the influx of people wishing to give birth to a child in Argentina, the country's authorities began to monitor the entry of foreign nationals into its territory more closely.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina stemmed from the fact that the country ' s authorities were not interested in the mass influx of foreigners wishing to obtain citizenship for their children and residence permits for themselves, and then to leave.
This is reported by Lenta.ru with reference to Professor Viktor Heifets, head of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supported such practices.
He noted that Argentina did not approve of turning the country into a trans-shipment point rather than a terminal.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
The expert explained that the child would retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision to grant an Argentine passport to the parents after obtaining a residence permit would be made by the court.
If it turned out that they had not actually lived in Argentina and had left immediately, citizenship could be refused.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, according to the specialist, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by "soil law", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport allows you to visit 170 countries without a visa, including the EU states and the UK.
It was previously reported that Argentina began to revoke the residence permit of Russians who received a document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It was also reported that six pregnant Russian women were denied entry to Argentina on suspicion of providing false information about the reasons for their trip.
Russia is expected to open hundreds of new fitness clubs
In Russia, citizens' interest in fitness services is being restored, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mostly small-format, may be opened in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
These figures are cited by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators Olga Kiseleva in an interview with the publication noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
President of the National Football Association Elena Silina noted that since 2020 every year there were more club closures than openings.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 per cent.
However, independent analysts cite other figures.
According to Contour.Over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main activity "work fitness center" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but as early as 2021, it began to recover.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian millionaire cities.
Russians began to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3% year-on-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend is maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis indicators by the end of the year.
The management company from Kirov was deprived of the license
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov region annulled the license to carry out business activities for the management of apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, by the decision of the Regional Arbitration Court, the license to carry out business activities for the management of apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota" was cancelled.
According to the regional State Inspectorate, the court decision was made as early as November 2022, but it came into force only in February 2023.
The arbitral tribunal revoked the license of the "manager" because the organization had repeatedly ignored the instructions of the State Inspectorate.
At present, all objects that were under the management of “Zaboty” have been excluded from the register of licenses for the implementation of business activities for the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64,800 square metres.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The Kirov administration knows that they are left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Inspectorate informed the City Hall about the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, Governor of the Kirov region Alexander Sokolov set before the employees of the State Inspectorate the task of liquidating 2/3 of the managing companies of the region by the spring, as they are too many.
The legitimacy of the governor's demands aroused doubts among Kirov Communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could have been taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
Antimonopoly officials seem to have also asked the prosecutor's office to verify the legality of the actions of the head of the region.
Wildberries will make paid packages at delivery points
Marketplace Wildberries will make packages at checkout points payable from February 13.
Their cost will vary from 6 to 15 rubles.
Now the packages are provided by the owners of the drop-off points.
Failure to do so is subject to a fine.
Starting Monday, February 13, packages at Wildberries pick-up points will no longer be available for free.
Marketplace users received a notification that buyers who need a package will have to pay from 6 to 15 rubles for it.

Earlier, Wildberries customers found a platform in debiting funds from cards, the data of which were previously deleted from their personal account.

The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
As it follows from it, the company has the right to debit money from remote cards without notifying the customer, if payment from others does not pass for some reason.
The company, commenting on the situation, said that payments with buyers are carried out with the permission of customers, and no leakage of bank card data can occur.

Comfortable cafeteria area
Came in with my daughter to get a pension.
They were welcomed, everything was clearly explained, the documents were scanned, the application was issued, how to make an appointment for subsequent appointments told.
At the entrance, the administrator and security are greeted culturally and respectfully.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - hall is there, toilet, really cooler with water would not hurt to buy more.
We came twice, everything is great!
I wish all employees peace, good luck and a decent salary, in this difficult time for all!!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine waiting for a salad with scallops (which tastes just like no other!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A nice cashier asked me with her or in the hall to make me a coffee, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the gym, 300 milliliters.
A few minutes later, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to be in ceramics, so I wanted to be in the hall.
I've been done to myself.
I'm asking why it's in the cup and not the cup.
The girl responds, Decka, they do not have cups of 300 ml.
That's how it fits in a human's head?
Ask with yourself or in the hall, i.e. determine for yourself the technology: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
Get the answer - in the hall, i.e. in the cup.
Specify the volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
To put a person in front of the fact that cups aren't that big.
Here, platter, paper cup, 300 ml.
Remarkably, this is the third such case in the Green District in my memory.
It's doubly remarkable that I wasn't offered a standard cup so I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink my coffee the way I wanted. I asked her myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Cafeteria of Green Surroundings and Green Surroundings - sides of the same medal or organization are not related?
If not connected, there is understanding.
If related - why the food and trade enterprise known in the city for its service and quality descended to the rhetoric of the stall at Kazan railway station?
The rhetoric is because, I repeat, this is the third time that this has happened to me.
I can't rule out that it's not just me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I get the impression she's acting on her own.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please write down the actions for your employees in this case, even if you try to the service.
We really like the circus, we've been going there since we were kids.
I saw the numbers with Nikulin Yu himself.
And now with my children, my nephews.
I like the atmosphere of the circus, so do the programs.
Location of seats is very convenient.
You can see the arena from almost anywhere, and the backs of those sitting in front of you don't get in the way.
The circus is very intimate, family-friendly!
This time they went to the New Year's program.
A little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I'd like a room with magic and more animals.
Too bad you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby anymore.
But I guess there's a reason for that.
And overall a very nice place!!
I wish you prosperity and make us happy with your rooms!!!
Liked the developer Oddelstroy, chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
Use quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to see the complex, when there were no walls, so that you could see everything live, although how many apartments we considered and no developer offered us this.
Favorite ski resort of Russia!
The most fun is the gentle dense forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are boring and short for me.
The longest ones in sector E, there's even less.
But overall great atmosphere, lots of different cafes and bars, so fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
Great master Peri!
Did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is cloakroom and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come for an order by the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application and wait at the window sill for more than 30 minutes my order.
Today in business such a service is unacceptable!
The answer of the care service - we try.
At the register, no apology, it's just - it's not our fault, it's a program.
Neither call to warn, no other technical possibilities of communication with regular previously loyal customers you have not found.
The impotent are “trying”, and the business has to work.
Thank you, everybody, we're all parting.
We will not order more from you and recommend the more.
Spoiled mood, waiting for guests, the hostess's apology-- not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
The car was expected to receive in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but the fact came out 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania performed).
As a result, I am very satisfied with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
Rented a cottage for 4 days for 3 people.
The cottages are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the cottage has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge are available.
Of the shortcomings can be distinguished is too little space, in the bathroom terribly small shower.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and things to dry especially nowhere, had to take the owners dryer and put it instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
And so in general, it's a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There's wine and beer for those who want to drink.
Center of Moscow, I recommend
Wonderful place with very polite staff, will definitely come again.
On site there are all necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good renovation and all amenities.
Beautiful and aesthetic place, walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
Very liked, and Russia in miniature, and Lakes Park and landscape.
In winter many natural slides for children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We are constantly buying here, the prices are low, and the quality is on the level!
Very responsive staff, will advise and answer all questions of interest)
I recommend this store to everyone to visit! ❤️
Location as convenient for anyone.
It's normal for me personally.
Served quickly, unless any of the visitors are dumb.
It's convenient on the record.
The staff is attentive, will advise, guide, advise even if you did not come on reception days.
Basically normal.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly, prices are adequate in comparison with other services.
I thought the remote was an ejector, and these smart-asses did everything to me.
Huge thanks to the young guys!
Ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours on March 8.
After 6 hours brought flowers in a package, as if stolen (there is hardly enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were in the vase, I knew something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the website and the color turned out not to be the one I ordered.
Decided to recount and it turned out that the tulips were an even number of 20 pieces.
The support in Wotsap responded to my indignation about the colour and number of colours, "apparently the colour has been mixed up."
The next day I wrote again and I was offered a refund of 15%.
I think that's an extreme degree of arrogance and probably falls under the definition of fraud.
I've already filed a report to the IRS that they refused to issue me a check.
Next up is Rospotrebnadzor and the court.
I don't recommend anyone contacting this organization.
More than 10 years I go to the master Samira, for dyeing and hair cutting.
I want to cancel the professionalism of the master Samira, she perfectly does her job, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always attentively listens to the wishes of the client, and the client always remains satisfied with the result.
To all relatives and relatives I recommend this master.
All her work is always done at the highest level !!!’
Huge thanks to Master Samira 😍
Welcome was in this game club,I can say the prices are excellent,many gaming computers,also there are drinks and food.
Some of the minuses of broken keyboards fly away buttons, if you take the "normal gameplay" then computers are poorly pulled:(
Therefore, rating 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
My son goes to his class, and my mom goes to fitness boxing at night.
Administrators are super attentive, coaches are professional.
They arrange themed holidays for children, keep an eye on cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and study.
A six-year-old child is already holding the punch well, strong OFP.
Recommended for children, moms and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
The work is performed qualitatively, caring, clarifies everything.
With girls you can always talk about something!
It was the third time!
I won't regret anything!
Finally I can grow hair after lightening !!!
And Vita's studying coloring.
Therefore, it is she who will soon be able to combine blon with keratin!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰
Master receiver Elena Polyanskaya very responsive master, explained clearly everything that is included in the regulatory TO.
Also during the repair of my car rendered every assistance.
And also thanks to the master Valery Ushakov for careful and professional work.
I was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out qualitatively.
The only thing that confused when registering for the workshop was not enough correct information on the work regulations, when attending the workshop the regulations were more clearly explained.
I would like to express my gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
It took a very rare, certificate to the guardianship authorities to approve the transaction with the real estate, the employees very kindly met and helped to issue this certificate, although they could refuse, as it is not their responsibility.
Thank you very much!
There are very soulful people working here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, did not regret that came to this hairdresser!👍
Master Nahida made an impeccable painting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend ❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
For the 800th anniversary restored, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a field trip, that's great, too.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - a surprisingly beautiful collection
We have known Olea for more than 3 years, we use our services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learning new things and expanding the space for four-legged ones, which only arouses admiration and trust.
Always with peace of mind we leave our crib.
Daily video reports, if necessary pick up / take a zoo taxi.
And also bring clean and delicious)
generally fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for the care and attentive personal attitude to our pets 🐕💜
Saty Moose Restaurant is located next to the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
Before visiting it is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
Nice well-groomed zoo.
Less Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
Were on weekdays- entrance adult 300₽, schoolchild 170.
There were few people, with pleasure walked, looked at the animals.
Ant-eater impressed)
In Moscow, by the way, they haven't seen him.
On the territory there are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, toilet clean free, also saw a charging station phones.
In general, I recommend 👍
Salon at the highest level!!!
Very satisfied with the services of the beautician Natalia Kuznetsova, I go only to her.
I do all kinds of facial cleansing - both hardware and mechanical.
100% satisfied.
Master of his craft👍
Everything tells in detail about the features of the skin, picked up cosmetics caring for my skin type, just perfect.
I walk now happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you Natalie!!!
Great club with huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hammam and great coaches!
Of the minuses a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club like a public bath!
Special emphasis on the women's section.
On weekdays, starting from 19:00 there are a lot of people!
I'm betting a three, and that's only because of the first visit, when I got to the counselor, if I'm not mistaken, Timur, but I could be mistaken.
I issued everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything clear, the son also decided to issue the card, and unfortunately the consultants are busy with their affairs, clients are waiting, the son approached the consultant in the end, which everything is up to the light, several times frowned in the meeting room, something fun discussing, in the end the son left, nothing formalized, for pardon the consultant said, well, as I was present at this meeting, was at made.
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and that attitude.
It is a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude to customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to the appearance of reels), the staff knows their range, help in the choice of styles.
You can wear both a slim girl and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
Located near the metro, even a small parking is available.
We recommend!
It was September, celebrating his birthday.
In principle, for the service and quality of food everything liked: prices are low, portions of medium size, so you can eat, or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation.
When ordering, he specified the number and everything that was required, after which instantaneously called the bot to check the phone.
Nothing further.
When I arrived at the restaurant, it was discovered that the table had not been reserved.
Luckily, there were vacancies and we were able to accommodate.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent price / quality ratio.
I recommend!
Went to a cleanse the other weekend.
It is the first time I see such an organized staff, who treated many of my questions with the utmost trepidation, suggested how and what is better to do for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I heartily recommend it, the only clinic that doesn't want to heat up money on my memory.
Good shopping mall.
There's everything!
Large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops.
You can always find something to your liking.
From food to gifts.
no more foot into this store.
bought a washing machine, told us what city we were, so we'll get lucky ourselves.
The manager in the hall said where to go to the warehouse, the question "load"? He said yes. ))
in the warehouse carried out without a box, the question why? answered that so all ship.
when she began to insist, put two strips of foam, like that will do!
to load the trailer refused, but not their work, load themselves, they have delivery)))
When I said I'd turn down the order at all, they said, "Yeah, whatever you want, we don't care," and one of them finally went down the ramp and helped my dad put the car in the trailer.
This is the first time I've come across such a sham service.
Good shopping center Cleanly tidy. large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic" entertainment children's center"Nevidalia".
On the lower floor there is a large hypermarket "Renta".
Convenient,large parking convenient location.
Good supermarket of cosmetics, underwear and home goods.
Varied assortment, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, advise.
Everyone will find something for themselves.
Good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very good, nice place.
I advise everyone never to make a wrong choice.The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will pass super.
I recommend to visit)
We would like to express our gratitude to the Clock Marina, who was our funeral agent.
Having come to us on call, she took care of all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always in touch and informed us how things were going.
Thanks to her, we escorted a loved one with dignity.
Everything was organized, neatly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, perfectly understanding the state of the loved ones, gave advice on how to be better and simply sympathized with us in a human way.
He's a very good expert in his field.
Thanks for everything.
After receiving a lot of good reviews, I turned to RemSteirMash and I was appointed Master Alexander.
He started the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for service.
Everyone discussed and set a time - 2:00.
The next day came - a call from the master in the morning and a statement that he will not be able to come, a complicated application (how is it? and where is "completely free?") and, if he can, then instead of the appointed 14.00 will appear after 18.00.
We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time another master calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all scheduled business aside!
In short, the clever master Ivan arrived, fixed the breakdown, for which I thank him.
So don't make empty promises and don't waste your time.
Evening observations did not live up to expectations.
First there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked into the telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children climbed to watch several times, adults crowded and could not let others watch.
The objects that we looked at in the telescope were both the size of a normal star, and without a telescope you can look at for free.
The girl answered questions not very accessible, not understanding that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600 rubles.
The amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
Price list is average.
Sit, eating 2-3 dishes for two (very large porcini) + cocktail, about 2500 p👌
There are interesting beer cocktails, based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho highly recommend to try.
Price 420 rubles for 0.5 l.
And in general, the restaurant itself is very tasty cuisine, I do not know how others, and I really liked it, I will advise my friends to go there)
Great store, I've been buying from them for a long time, since the opening.
Good quality goods.
Bought a mixer, it's been five years, and it works fine and in good condition.
So when we did the global repair in the apartment all the necessary things were taken here.
Great gas station!!!
It is located very conveniently, there are and arrange the center and side of the area, generally convenient)!
The quality of gas is good, I refuel 2 times a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is excellent!!!
Eagles by card and by cash, by literacy do not cheat.
Shop, liked it!
You can choose any model, at a democratic price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help with the choice.
I took my daughter's laptop to study, 'cause her laptop was covered.
Helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
He helped with the wine selection, because with such a large menu, it's hard to figure out on your own.
Experience with sommelier interesting, charming Vasily, such in Moscow is lacking.
I ate sushaka - magic, chef respect.
Children's menu as everywhere: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. My guys ate pizza, it's FIRE!
With truffle appreciated adults, and children with ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
The staff is good, all smiling, friendly.
We liked it.
The brand new WB pick-up point is conveniently located.
Work schedule, from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends and holidays.
Inside the HVZ there are fitting booths.
Very good place.
Here work real professionals who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat room in Wotsapa for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
Glad that the product can be immediately viewed and tried on.
It's great to be near the house.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient arrival, own parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
Wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different shows.
We were at the Frog Princess Show today.
At the moment, this is the best of children's performances.
It was very interesting, lots of puppets, special effects.
Even the 14-year-old son, just went for the company, and said it was a very good performance.
Rested with her husband for 10 days in January 2023.
Rest was successful on "5", liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival they called, clarified what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price is 850 rubles), arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, the barrier was released without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, processed quickly, 15-20 minutes.
There is an elevator in all the buildings - this is a big plus!
The 2-bed room is spacious, the floors in the room and in the bathroom are warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two armchairs), panoramic windows (in the 5th housing).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in the 5th case.
Everything is clean, change towels and linen at your request, but if you do not ask to change, then still change on the 4th day, linen of good quality.
The territory is well-kept, everywhere shops, clean paths, in the evening beautiful lighting.
A minibus takes you to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
To the public transport stop 5 min.
In the dining room there are friendly guys, always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but here who goes for what, we all perfectly arranged, and the choice and quality, there was always and fish and chicken and bites or etc., vegetables for garnish every day, baking its delicious, more than 4 drinks, coffee grain, for breakfast always baked pancakes, but cheese and sausage is not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, temperature 11 - 16 ° C, sunshine.
We liked everything, really rested.
There is a desire to come again and precisely in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It's a pity that the pool will not be put into operation and the fitness complex.
Thank you to the whole staff of the sanatorium for their coordinated and high-quality work!
We've been going to "Flight" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
Everything is very much like it, the coach praises) this is the most important.
Let's go to Valeria Pleshkova!)
I never thought my daughter would be so flexible!
Wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to take a look at this promising place - and we did not miss it!
Prices are very affordable, and incredibly delicious pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, even the crust remains.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in a word, recommend:)
It just so happened that I went to Tomarov Hospital with high blood pressure and high heart rate.
And was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover wiped window sills, furniture, doors.
Food is dietetic, but excellent!!!
Surprised that at 7 am they bring tea with sandwiches (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, all to one put and intramuscular, and intravenous injections!!!
As long as the I.V. is standing, they'll come in, ask about your well-being...
Earlier it happened to do ultrasound of the heart, but so - for the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, young man).
Special thanks to the treating doctor Vetokhina Claudia Fedorovna!
A real professional: attentive, literate, gives an exhaustive answer to any question; picked up the dosage and drugs, from which normalized both blood pressure and heartbeat, which previously could not achieve after contacting other doctors.
Many thanks to the chief physician Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the medical staff, nurses, and cooks!
When visiting the customer service, the impression remained good.
I met the administrator in the lobby.
Competent and courteous specialists quickly and patiently help clients on all questions.
The specialist assisted in filing the application and clarified my question.
For a small store very even a good choice of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, all sorts of things.
Working around the clock, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It's great when there's a place in town where you can ride down the mountain.
Hoists hoist and on the weekend of course the queue is going 40 seconds descent and 5-10 minutes queue.
But overall Cool, immersion in the atmosphere of positive and winter, even if the roads are dirt and damp.
Turned to the service for the repair of the iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery had to be replaced.
Contacted directly with the master Alexander, who explained all the details of the repair and immediately indicated the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done qualitatively.
The masters are very pleasant in communication, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when the parts were replaced, the camera was hit, the focus was lost.
Immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected in the shortest possible time, everything is working properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is nice to have a dialogue.
Prices, compared to other services, acceptable, have.
If you need repair again - I will definitely contact you!
Scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires careful, operational and qualitative attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the keepers
Excellent f/c
Responsive concierge, garbage is cleaned, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We opened in our area a good, cozy place to relax.
There are all the necessary shops.
A killer and varied food court.
Tables are located in cozy areas.
No boredom.
Well, we've been, we've tried...
The interior has nothing in common with the Italian cozy cafe...
Space is very small, the tables are rectangular, like in the dining room.
Pizza... well, if you haven't tasted better, I'll like it. It seemed kind of faceless.
I did not like the fact that the waiter is always standing behind your back and your interlocutor opposite almost always looks in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yeah, they're delicious.
We're not coming here again and I'm not recommending it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best foreman I've ever done a haircut and a dye.
Very carefully and qualitatively everything does, I am happy to go to her, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I'm only taking my daughter to Lena's.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We from Nizhny broke down on the way, kind people from KatResource quickly reacted and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, I wish more such good people!
And the serves are clean and good!
We came to the concert of Sergey Chigrakov.
Great concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come this year for the planned concerts.
Quiet place, wonderful Georgian restaurant, on weekends and holidays playing live music!
The staff is pleasant and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The score is the highest, I love this place ❤
Park in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is room for both children and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more ups and downs in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear distribution of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't get any bad food.
Often promotions and discounts.
Glad it's close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
Been to the bar twice, everything liked, polite staff, delicious dishes and most importantly - great music, DJs know their job.
The only, the second time disappoints the soloist of the group "Hands Up Band".
Not only does she sing softly, but she also reads the lyrics of most songs from her phone, especially when they were Hands Up songs.
It's kind of illogical (performing at the Hands Up Bar, Hands Up Band).
Rested at the beginning of March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
For his birthday, they gave him a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
Breakfast is just a headache.
There's a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant to the room, pay for the service 20% above.
Restaurant prices are a little overpriced.
Taste for a three plus.
The water park was included in the cost of living.
The water park itself can not be called the best in Russia.
But the masseuse was a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure a little disappointing: neither goodbye, nor a good trip.
The clerk at the entrance didn't even help opening the door seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
It's something that needs to be worked on to keep the mark.
It's a great place to hang out with your friends.
Large and comfortable steam room, there is billiards, outdoor pool, karaoke.
Food is delicious, drinks are fresh)
Workshop on level!
In a short time he repaired already 3 pairs of shoes (2 husband and 1 wife).
It's all right.
Quality of work at height.
Special thanks to the master for the careful treatment and quality of work!
Great basketball school!
The son walks for 5 months and he likes it very much, he is looking forward to every training.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and soulful atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I order through the Internet myself.
Great location of the store.
Plus there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
Good store AV - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their helpfulness!
There is a cafeteria for several tables.
I am often - everything is fine!
Nice pool!
I am specifically about the "frog", Coach our Anastasia Vitalyevna really likes the child and is professional!!
The locker rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are hair dryers!
I love bakery cupcakes, service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee always on top.
But alas, not this time, ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout did not make coffee until I reminded them, they did, it is impossible to drink, it stinks and remains the aftertaste of spoiled milk, decided not to finish and just left.
Last time I had a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it.
Be careful, please, as I'm not a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows go this way!
Victoria adjusts perfectly, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which well removes all the down, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected by the type of hair and skin, thanks to which the paint lasts for a long time.
Better not do eyebrows!
Thank you so much for arranging my mom's move!
Moving is always a great stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, qualitatively.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
All at the highest level.
For a long time we treat teeth with the whole family precisely in Novodent.
Recently treated teeth son 8 years old, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You do not have to wait long, there are no queues because the appointment is by appointment.
For me so the most delicious shaurma in Tambov only here, I am not a lover of shaurma, BUT when you want something bad only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat with lots of stuffing.
And I don't know why, but it never leaks in me.
Often when you finish eating shaurma base no longer eat because there is a lot of water sauce well short fuuuu...., but not here.
That's why you guys are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
In the dining room the food is always fresh.
Interesting lessons at the school museum, various activities are held during the school year
Nice shop, polite staff, nice assortment.
However, the big downside is that the goods that are brought, apparently destroyed right in the trading hall.
Sometimes there is little space to pass between the rows, and also not very pleasant when the goods stand directly on the floor, without pallets, but it is rather a remark to the organization, not to a particular store
An exquisite example of Soviet architecture.
Strict splendor, which is treasured with trepidation.
I got double pleasure from the concert, in large part due to the atmosphere of a cultural house.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that it was really the entrance to the light.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
Completely accidentally stumbled into this online auto parts store.
Called, specified the wincode, said wait)
Ten minutes later, they called back, offered several options.
Since the machine personal working did not save and asked to order a good clutch kit LUK.
Five minutes later, they called back and said there was good news for you.
If you take not the whole basket + disk + survival, and take LUK basket + disk set and separately squeeze LUK, it will be cheaper for 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
I took the clutch and went to the service.
When I removed the gearbox, I found that I still needed a flywheel and the faster, the better.
I already knew where to turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment on the call (for the first time also paid on receipt).
The next day, the flywheel was on his hands.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I'm happy that everything came quickly, that we went to a meeting.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year party succeeded in glory, but with nuances.
Booked a double table, turned out they put me behind a four-seater.
But no trouble.
It's just weird they didn't warn you.
Kitchen for four, fish failed at all.
Hosts with contests made at a school-level PowerPoint, to be honest, not very good.
But when it comes to music, everything's perfect.
The atmosphere was high.
Everything else seems like bullies.
Thank you for the event
I leave my feedback,with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 Chelyabinsk.
In this institution work only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the PBS department and in the maternity ward and in the postpartum ward.
But special thanks to Kotlyarova E.Yu., this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., this is the midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much, for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Lovely shop.
Large assortment of balls, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, with left always with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the institution on recommendation.
The food was amazing, no programs, a little cheeky waiters, but we were in a great staff with children and celebrated an important event, were friendly.
There was no fire-supply plateau, the children were waiting.
You can go for good food.
