Criteria for admitting children to preschool education at Kindergarten, Prague 8, U School Garden 8 - for the academic year 2022/2023
The decisive factor for admission to preschool education is the actual place of residence of the applicant, in the case of foreigners - the place of residence, in the relevant school district of the Ministry of Health, at the time of application for preschool education in the Kindergarten, Prague 8, In the School Garden 8.
Another evaluated criterion is the child's age.
Children are admitted gradually according to the criteria listed below until the capacity of the kindergarten is filled.
And, if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
- Letter from the occupation.
Kherson.
"Natasha, we are holding on with all our might.
It feels like they are scared.
Very afraid.
They can stop anyone on the street and force them to repeat several times that they are great, that they are strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and in our heads, it spins - how are you, bastards, scared if for your greatness, you need someone to keep repeating about this greatness.
How you are not confident in yourself.
It's like having sex with an impotent man, to whom you have to endlessly repeat that he is strong, that everything is working out for him, trying very hard and persistently for him, and all the while thinking when this painful torment will finally end.
We repeat this in order to keep us all safe.
Because it's very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a mindless body with a machine gun.
Because later, when this filth is driven out of our land, we will need to organize the city.
No matter who we talk to now, everyone says the same thing.
Words that smell of decay in the city.
We will probably need a lot of cleaning supplies to just wash the sidewalks, buildings, and even trees for a long time. Because everything these inhumans touched smells of decay.
Yesterday, one woman, a retiree, refused to repeat that they are big.
Three healthy men undressed her and left her on the street, forbidding anyone to approach her to help.
For three hours she stood undressed on the street and just spoke loudly:
"Do not come near me, my dear ones."
Do not put yourself in danger.
Please!
We still have a lot of things to do with you...
Then!
And more.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It's even hard for me to imagine what they don't steal.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting from children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are scared because flyers are constantly being posted around the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbolism.
We are waiting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
And when they get close, the people of Kherson will deal with the filth with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they hurry.
And we will wait.
We will wait.
We will grit our teeth, clench our fists until our fingers go numb, and wait.
Because we have something worth waiting for.
Once and for all.
And none of this filth remained.
And then we will clean the city.
Long.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
The author of the written is not indicated for understandable reasons.
and I need communication. I've become quite sour. I know that few people want to communicate with sour people, but I still don't lose hope.
How satisfied are you with your housing?
Do you need help?
Are you working in the same profession as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar questions are currently being addressed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in the context of studies among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic due to the war.
The conclusions will help better understand their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
Everyone who provided a functional email when requesting humanitarian aid will receive an invitation to participate in a survey (from the address invitation@click4survey.cz).
The questionnaire is filled out only once by each person!
By filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help us to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
PRODUCTION TECHNICIAN
,MECHANIC IN PRODUCTION
We manufacture electronic microscopes and spectrometers that assist scientists all over the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics or modern medicines - none of this would be possible without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues to join our production team, who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology, and want to have a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities for both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I would like to say a few words on this occasion.
A strong desire to meet with residents to discuss important, pressing issues, but meetings are prohibited by law because the country is at war.
I would be grateful for any sound advice and any help in my desire to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are strong.
Together we will overcome all difficulties.
Together we will win.
So, get in touch.
I will listen to everyone.
I will be immensely happy and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the conditions for the payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all Ukrainian refugees arriving are entitled to the first aid payment of 5000 crowns, without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
To receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove their severe financial situation - to be considered unemployed, not to own any property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor has decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è‚É£ The first aid payment will no longer be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily meals, and hygiene supplies, they will not be eligible for a payment of 5000 crowns.
The government will start to consider that the basic aid was provided in kind (housing, food, and hygiene products), which means the purpose of humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and there is no need for cash payments.
This measure is intended to solve the problem with Roma refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic solely for financial aid.
2Ô∏è‚É£ the right to receive the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth financial aid, as before, will only be available to those refugees who can prove an immediate need (such as unemployment, etc.).
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå as in the first point, only those Ukrainians who were not provided with free housing, daily multiple meals, and hygiene items will be able to receive financial assistance;
üìå the applicant must actually reside in the territory of the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of "aid tourism", when a refugee lives in one country, but comes to the Czech Republic for a few days solely for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address in the application for assistance does not match the address indicated in the Ministry of Internal Affairs database, the applicant will be asked to provide proof that they actually reside in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the assistance payment will be denied.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion crowns on humanitarian aid payments.
And today I spent the whole day digging defensive structures, and the whole city is digging, the forecasts for the near future are not very cheerful.
Honestly, I'm tired, it's very difficult to organize such a process.
We help the army dig trenches and ditches, for this someone needs to organize equipment and people, and as I am the village elder, these are my responsibilities.
All municipal enterprises are involved, and we also appeal to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We need to unite, because otherwise we won't overcome the Russians.
There is a lot of propaganda to make people lose faith and weaken resistance.
Honestly, I haven't picked up a shovel today, I hope I won't have to.
My kids put girly stickers on my phone case so I wouldn't forget that I'm female.
What will happen if the bill is passed?
‚òòÔ∏è A government commission will be formed with representatives from the President's Office, certain ministries and business associations, which will expediently review the tools of state regulation of economic activity.
‚òòÔ∏è The Commission and other executive bodies will review all permits related to conducting business in most sectors by the end of the year.
And they will suggest which permits or procedures need to be removed.
‚òòÔ∏è The Cabinet of Ministers will expedite the removal of all "unnecessary" permits and procedures.
Without any public discussion, in a behind-the-scenes mode!
‚òòÔ∏è It won't matter whether the Cabinet's decisions contradict current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the ability to influence the regulation of economic activities that may harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something akin to the Constitution of Ukraine.
‚òòÔ∏è The state will regulate business according to the principle "one new permit - minus two old ones".
Regardless of whether this will make any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
‚òòÔ∏è In a behind-the-scenes mode, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents regarding permits or procedures in the environmental sphere.
Forest protection, wildlife conservation, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc. are under threat!
‚òòÔ∏è Neither the public nor the parliamentarians will influence the process.
We don't even find out who and how changes the bylaws until the final decisions are made.
‚òòÔ∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the ability to influence are business associations.
Bill ‚Ññ8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Shortened review periods for permits, opaque procedures, absence of any decision-making criteria - this is a move towards the East, not towards the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the appeal.
They told her - grandma, the Russians have approached the village; Grab your cat and get in the van.
And she refused - what am I, an old mare... Save the children and the girls, I'll manage here... The old woman goes down into the cellar, stuffing cucumbers, rolling a barrel with chaff, a pile of troughs; There are doors - iron bolts and silver locks.
And behind the doors, someone is rattling chains.
"I never thought," says the old woman, "that I would live to see this."
Over seventy years old - and still going strong.
Go - just not through the cities, because I swear, you will bring us closer to "Putin kaput".
The cat hisses like a witch, the glass in the windows is cracking.
Tanks rumble and move between the houses.
Russians are entering the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the den.
Good day, go to the post office and confirm your identity through "check-in", then upon confirmation you will be given a code, and this code again you have to indicate in the registration on the internet and you are ready.
The bank card must be registered to the person who wants to receive the financial aid, another one will not work.
I did the same for a friend, it also indicated that some key was needed, but when she waited, waited in the government office there they told her why she came since she is already registered.
It also showed her, in this app, that some key was needed, but in reality, the registration is already going through without it.
Help me too, the application was submitted online on May 5th, but I can't understand whether to go to the labor office or wait.
It says that you will receive money on your card after processing your application, but it says that the identity is not confirmed, the banking system gives an error.
Good day, dear Ms. Angelina!
I want to express my point of view regarding the use of "in" / "on" in relation to the word "Ukraine".
The use of this term in recent decades has become a serious political issue.
Today's war of Russia against Ukraine was prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy.
Thank you for the interesting exercises and tasks, for the clear explanation of grammar, and pleasant communication.
We especially thank you for the technical support of the training, primarily for the textbook, which allowed us to understand what we sometimes did not grasp during the lecture.
These three months laid the foundation of our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish the entire creative team creative inspiration, peace, and happiness!
In its productions, it popularizes world classics in Ukrainian, among them "Lolita" (V. Nabokov), "Perfume" (P. S√ºskind), "Sin" by M.Kotsyubynsky, "Letter from an Unknown Woman" and "Beware of Pity" by S. Zweig, etc.
The works he stages are not easy to perceive, they require the investment of soul and heart.
The author skillfully leads the viewers to deep emotions and tears.
In his opinion, tears are a purification, a path to the recovery of the modern person.
Has a whole range of awards.
In 2005, he received the title "People's Artist of Ukraine", Laureate of the National Prize of Ukraine named after Taras Shevchenko (2007), but Mr. Mykhailo values the attention and love of the audience the most, and they respond with reciprocity.
Admirers of Mr. Mykhailo's talent hope that after the war they will again hear his saxophone playing, see his unparalleled ability to transform, and be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art.
Useful minerals of Ukraine
Minerals are classified by origin into magmatic, sedimentary, and metamorphic.
Therefore, their placement is closely related to the structure of the Earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
The fuel minerals mined in our country include: coal, brown coal, oil, natural gas, peat, and oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully meets its own needs in stone and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing a severe shortage of oil and natural gas.
Experience shows that until we have created a rational economy, a severe shortage can occur in anything.
Peat has long been mined in Polissya, Ukraine.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, agriculture, and in the glass, porcelain-faience, and food industries.
Various chemical substances, including acetone, phenols, paraffin, feed, yeast, are also obtained from peat.
Considerable deposits of oil shale are located in the Cherkasy and Kirovograd regions.
The geography of fuel resources placement is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources have a sedimentary origin, therefore they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as in the edge foothill depressions.
Stone coal.
94.3% of our country's coal deposits consist of bituminous coal.
Ukrainian anthracite coal is distinguished by its high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine, there are deposits of the highest grade of coal - anthracite, which contains up to 94-97% carbon.
1/3 of the coal is coking.
After special treatment, it is used during the smelting of iron and steel.
According to the explored reserves of coal, Ukraine ranks eighth in the world and first in Europe, and in terms of production - respectively eleventh and third.
The proven coal reserves in Ukraine are about 50 billion tons.
Estimated reserves - about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write "messages" on the shells they drop on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
Yes, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the Eurovision stage to save the soldiers trapped at "Azovstal" in Mariupol - and the next day the Russians wrote on the shells "Kalush, as you asked! #to Azovstal".
The rockets used by Russian military to shell the station in Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022, had "For the children" written on them.
Then, 61 people died from the shells with a cynical inscription, among them - 7 children.
The tradition of writing on shells appeared during the First World War.
During the Second World War, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies.
Then it helped soldiers maintain their fighting spirit while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on the shells by Russian soldiers are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these projectiles, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they do not like the political course of Ukraine.
Russia needs to be stopped so that similar "messages" do not reach any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing greeted us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
"We are transporting insulin, it requires a temperature regime - it cannot heat up."
Is it possible to go through the check in an accelerated mode?
The border guard allowed us to go to the front of the line, even the trucks courteously gave way.
Lviv
The city of Lviv is alive.
It's like the aorta of the Ukrainian body - an endless flow of people.
People from all regions of the country have found refuge and a sense of security here.
Some are going further to Europe, some are returning home, some are staying.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at the checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the cathedral windows battered by the dictation.
She wraps monuments and sculptures in white canvases.
But the war is not heard in the Market Square, where thousands of voices sound at once, it is not heard in the cafes and bars, where people continue to live.
Yes, life quiets down earlier - at 11 pm life hides from the curfew.
But it exists: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 pm and an alarm was announced, it could only be heard from a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpin
We paved the way to Kyiv through two of the numerous martyr cities - through Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities, where the air smells of hope.
People return and rebuild their lives despite the pain.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Shrapnel or automatic gunfire?..)
On the shattered balcony, a Ukrainian flag is unfurled.
Near the front door - holes, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And three people are lingering near these entrance doors.
They clean, mend, build a wall and with it a new life.
And two blocks down, a mother is walking with her child in the park.
I can't help but ask: "Did their father survive the execution of men in Bucha?
"Is he still walking with them?"
At the exit from Irpin - a graveyard of cars.
These are the same cars that civilians tried to leave in and were ruthlessly shot by Russian occupiers.
This cemetery has become an object of a peculiar "patriotic tourism".
If you go deeper and stand among the car skeletons, you can smell a heavy odor.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, sluggish air, it feels like you could cut it with a knife.
And weeks have passed since the passengers' death‚Ä¶
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.
And in one of the cars - an abandoned bicycle, in another - a warm children's jumpsuit.
Somewhere, a little book with airbag instructions was not completely burned.
Remnants of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
We drive on, I look back one last time to look at the city - and my eyes fall on the same bridge under which frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is that same overturned bus, and it was on these broken slabs that a Ukrainian soldier carried a child in white.
This child in the white jumpsuit probably survived.
But is there a chance that the child who wore the clothes left in one of the cars is still alive?
A man is sitting on a broken bridge, a camera over his shoulder.
Just sitting and looking at the gap between Kyiv and Bucha.
Doesn't take pictures, just looks.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge, and thinks: how is this possible?
"Happy holiday!" - a man joyfully exclaims to us. - "Happy City Day!"
On May 29, military Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Mykolaiv
Hero city, outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A frontline city that the occupiers just can't capture.
And we believe that they will not capture - the city is fighting and living.
At the corner of the streets, at every other intersection - neatly stacked tires and Bandera stripes.
Evening Mykolaiv is incredibly quiet now - the noise against which the city lived, has subsided.
No votes, no cars in the evenings.
And it's extremely dark at night.
Light camouflage for safety.
People live "by candlelight", or more precisely, by the light of their mobile phones.
At home, we only turn on the light in the kitchen - quickly and as needed.
Grandma covered the windows with heavy quilts, through which light does not penetrate.
A hunting rifle stands near my sister's crib.
"It's at hand from the 24th," says the father.
During air raids and the sounds of explosions, we hide in garages or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in a frontline city, it is very difficult to live in a state of constant alarm.
When should we live then?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers away from the city, shots from "peonies" reach the October district, covering Kulbakino.
It flies close to my relatives several times.
On the neighboring block, across the road from us.
The windows at grandma's neighbors' house were blown out, the children took them to their place, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of Ingulsky and Central districts.
Life goes on.
On the central Cathedral Street, a siren is wailing, and an elderly couple is sitting on a bench, chatting about something, calmly discussing.
A cyclist rides past them.
Watching with dad - what will we do?
"So... Shall we go for a coffee?"
So we sit on Soborna Street (formerly Soviet, by the way) in a small park near the monument to Saint Nicholas.
And what else to do?
Honestly, when the siren catches you off guard on the street, often there is nowhere to hide, no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I'm looking at the building of the regional state administration, or more precisely, through it.
This is not just a hole in the building, it's a hole in the heart of every resident of Mykolaiv.
On the lawn near the entrance lies a huge trident - it once adorned the Regional State Administration.
Now, in the place where the trident once stood, there is an empty "nothing".
Just like at the office of the head of the Regional State Administration and a dozen offices around.
The rocket landed precisely on Kim's table.
The war takes on a completely different shape when it's not in the news, but under your feet.
I'm walking through the corridors of the Regional State Administration, and with each step, I hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor - someone had submitted requests and applications, but now it doesn't matter.
On the table of one of the surviving cabinets - a dusty makeup bag.
On the bedside table - a flower.
Took her home, replanted her, let her live at least.
Met a security guard who was on duty on March 29.
Survived.
"Fixed it, sewed it up, - shows the head. - Already back at work."
Only journalists can get into the Regional State Administration.
Together with us - a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, live broadcasts, interviews.
According to official data - 36 fatalities.
This is "September 11th in Mykolaiv style", "a monument to the Russian world", comments the press attache of the regional head.
The Mykolaiv Regional State Administration is just one of the wounds on the body of Mykolaiv.
And these wounds will take a long time to heal.
Even when Denmark helps to restore the ODA, the people of Mykolaiv will always see a terrible void in it.
Russia has started a new "gas war".
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of military actions, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transportation system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped gas supply to Bulgaria and Poland, in May - to Finland.
In June, Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the "Nord Stream" pipeline.
Official Berlin expects that Russia will cut off natural gas supplies this way in July.
Such blackmail was also used by Russia in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
Gas has always been for Russia not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political issues.
Russia is not interested in establishing healthy economic relations.
For her, the priority is the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West.
Financing the Russian economy is like donating to a third world war.
The upcoming winter will be challenging, but it will give Europe the opportunity to become independent from Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to quickly diversify gas and oil supplies.
But in order to become energy independent from Russian energy, the EU needs time.
Meanwhile, the Putin regime is intimidating Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and the absence of heating in homes.
European countries, especially those dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may experience a shortage.
But this crisis will stimulate a more frugal attitude towards natural resources and increase energy efficiency.
Europe wins when it rejects Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
The temporary discomfort is worth enduring so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia is burning the crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian Army is using incendiary shells that destroy mature grain and oilseed crops.
With this, Russia is causing the spread of hunger in the world.
Due to the Russian war, the number of people worldwide suffering from food shortages could increase by over 40 million.
At the same time as destroying Ukrainian crops, the Russians are stealing already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroying agricultural infrastructure, and blocking sea exports.
The destruction of Ukraine's agricultural potential is another manifestation of Russia's military aggression.
Thus, Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the global one.
More sanctions are needed against Russia to prevent it from continuing to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital Transformation launches an innovative hotline format - the virtual center Diya.Business.
Forced migrants from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for arranging their own stay, registering a business, employment, and receiving assistance.
Therefore, the virtual center Diya.Business is being launched to provide all necessary answers in a remote format, while Ukrainians cannot return home.
It's scary how you have to fear every important day, and how you never know the day or the minute what might happen.
Good day, Hanna, could I ask you to call back the pediatrician and ask when we can come for Darusia's next vaccination.
They were supposed to be tomorrow, I can't come because I need to replace the car battery, it will be by the end of the week.
The neighbor brought a cable and we charged from Marina's car.
But the car's panel says the battery needs to be replaced.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia is supposed to bring it from Ukraine, and then they will replace it for me here.
I will try to start the car tomorrow, if it works, we will go by ourselves, I will leave grandma in the car and will not turn off the engine.
If I don't make it, then I'll write to you and you'll come for us.
I'm very sorry to bother you, to distract you from your work.
Okay, let's leave at 11:45 to avoid any risk.
"The war is not over yet, and the fate of our new neighbors also becomes our reality.
We hear stories of escape to a safe place, tales of mothers telling their children about the great adventure they are embarking on together, to get them into hastily loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and are afraid of all adults, who still don't quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
The stories of children, for whom the only memory of home is a toy they could clutch during many hours spent in overcrowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, - emphasize the organizers.
At the end of each journey - a return to a safe home.
But this trip is different, scarier.
This trip did not end even after more than eight months.
A return home is anticipated.
The theme of war is ubiquitous, so our march may seem redundant.
On the contrary, in the conditions of growing antipathies and hostile attitudes in society, which are fueled and exploited by populists, we want to note that involuntary wanderers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in a poetic form and thus, apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
Currently, they are a part of it".
Despite such a painful theme, the parade was still managed to be made bright and hopeful.
To this, masters and craftswomen added their touch, who together with children and adults created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, rag dolls, little houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade went from Campi to Wenceslas Square, and at each stop, a huge performance was played, the dramaturgy of which was developed by Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to preserve the bright idea of the parade and at the same time to show what Ukrainians are facing now," says the playwright. - Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects normal life, which is interrupted by an air attack.
The first to come to the rescue are the glowing birds - they cover the children first with their wings.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of wings protecting becomes even more relevant.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song is spreading through the column.
And all creatures came back to life: sunflowers, dolls, toys and even little houses.
Such symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who have helped and continue to help Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we can overcome this difficult path and safety will prevail in our homes."
The wife sends her husband to the market to buy snails for skin care.
On his way, the man meets friends and goes on a three-day drinking binge, of course, not coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers about the snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
He's thinking about what to tell his wife about why he was gone for so long.
He knocks on the door, spills snails on the floor, his wife opens the door, and he, herding them with his hands, says:
- Well, here you are!
Come in, come in, come in...
Our editorial team spoke with Ukrainian refugee Marina, who worked in the field of building and structure architecture in her hometown of Nikopol.
"Currently, I am trying to establish myself as an artist," said the Ukrainian woman.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, worry for loved ones.
In the conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, there is a sense of confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she and her children have found themselves.
But the woman believes in her strength and tries to adapt to life in Prague, without giving up the thought of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Marina is originally from Nikopol, which is in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
That's where she met her husband and gave birth to two children - a son and a daughter.
Worked as an architect at the State Nikopol Institution.
"By education, I am an architect of buildings and structures, graduated from Dnipro Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
"Before this, I studied at an art school and graduated from a lyceum with a specialization in 'artist-designer'," Marina shared.
And everything was fine, but her life changed on February 24th.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the pressure of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina, without hesitation, left Ukraine with her children.
Prague became a refuge for the woman.
"Of course, a new city, big, crowded... A new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs tell me.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy for me.
Moreover, I am not ashamed to ask for help from the Czechs and have never felt any aggression from them.
"I thank them for this," Marina shared.
According to her, in resolving issues related to finding housing, visa processing and insurance, submitting documents for benefits, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Absence of a place in the kindergarten
Having received a tolerated stay visa, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
"Of course, I want to find a job in my field.
"But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands...", she said.
"We were not accepted into the kindergarten because there are no places."
They say that you need to find adaptation groups for children, but where they are, no one specifically knows.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
"She was eager to help me find a place in a kindergarten for children, calling a number of different institutions, but...", continues Marina.
"Generally, I am very concerned about the state of my children, they find it hard to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient.
I can't say that the children are bothering me, but if they were in kindergarten, I would be able to attend Czech language courses peacefully.
Once I took the little ones to a Czech lesson, they played a bit, then started to get restless.
"I, like a normal mother, was distracted, couldn't study properly... If only there were language courses for adults with children or someone was with the little ones during the study... But my daughter is so attached to me," the woman sighs.
"Of course, we, along with our children, attend various free events that are specifically created for refugees from Ukraine, for which we are greatly thankful to the Czech Republic," added Marina.
When the children are asleep, Marina engages in self-education, learning Czech online, because she understands that it will help her find a job and somehow self-organize in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
Once Marina was browsing job vacancies online and saw an announcement: "As part of the initiative of the Association "Spolek Zaedno" with the support of the EC representation in the Czech Republic, we are organizing a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague for "12 stars for Ukraine".
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.
Only creative imagination is required from the participants...".
Marina could not miss this opportunity.
"I gathered the courage and applied for participation."
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we spent the whole day drawing.
Before this, I couldn't sleep, I was worried.
"Moreover, I haven't picked up a brush in six years," the Ukrainian woman shared.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, among which 12 paintings are works by Ukrainian artists.
"The theme of the paintings was open, but we still agreed to use Ukrainian themes in our works - we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis for our palette.
"Therefore, the collection of paintings is dominated by blue and yellow colors," added Marina.
30 candidates participated in the event, out of which only 12 were selected.
Marina was among them.
On June 1st, an art exhibition will take place in Prague with their participation, supported by the EU representation in the Czech Republic.
"That's how life goes."
"All your once acquired knowledge and skills can come in handy, and also support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," Marina noted.
"Currently, I am trying to realize myself as an artist.
Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
"But something needs to be done...," the woman said.
Marina is grateful to the Czech Republic for its hospitality and friendliness, but believes that the war will end soon and she will return to Ukraine with her children.
Active combat operations are ongoing in the south of Ukraine.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will need a considerable amount of time to fully recover from the full-scale war initiated by Russia.
However, Ukrainians are not waiting for better times, but have already started cleaning their cities and villages from Russian garbage, rebuilding the infrastructure.
Kyiv region took the hit in the first days of the full-scale war, when Russian occupiers wanted to break through to the capital and capture it within a few days.
These cities and villages have experienced active combat, the atrocities of the Russian army, and in some places - occupation.
At the beginning of April, the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Alexander Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after active combat and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public spaces.
Ukraine is cleansing itself from the Russian world.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan for a quick takeover of Ukraine, Russia began a new stage of this war - informational.
Russia is trying to force the world to change its view on the Russian war and to decrease support for Ukraine from the international community.
International organizations are evaluating the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine fight the aggressor, thus becoming accomplices in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report: Ukrainian military are setting up positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure objects.
In doing so, it ignored the fact that it only concerns objects from which the civilian population has been completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to the information attacks of the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia attacked Ukraine, occupies its territories, kills and tortures the civilian population, destroys cities and villages.
The Russian Federation is guilty in the war, it has no right to any actions on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian warriors have the right to defend their land and drive the enemy out of occupied territories.
Help Ukraine stand against Russia on all fronts!
I am sure that everyone in the world has at some point dreamed of their ideal home.
Believe it or not, I am not an exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.
He was near the beach and had a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I will definitely be happy to live in the heart of picturesque landscapes.
My house would be a two-story cottage with a wonderful exotic garden in front of it, and there would be many different flowers and fruit trees.
I will also have a garage for my car.
With a car, I will be able to commute to work, go shopping or simply travel with my family, wherever our eyes may lead us.
In my ideal house, there will be at least six rooms: a bright and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, an office with a workspace, and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with bedside tables and dressers.
There will be many interesting books in the bookcases in the office.
The living room will become the most visited place in the house, where the whole family can gather together, share news or just have fun.
That's why there would be a large sofa with small pillows, a few chairs, a small chest of drawers, a huge TV and a long built-in aquarium.
Additionally, in my ideal house, there would be an attic where we could set up a home cinema or a game room.
Behind my house, there would be a pool with several hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we could exercise daily to stay in shape or just engage in various team sports such as volleyball, basketball, football, etc.
My ideal home would be large and cozy, beautiful and lovely.
I would really like to live in it.
But this is just my dream... I have to make it a reality.
Hello, how many men are there supposed to be, so I know which room to prepare? Is she alone?
I passed the letters to you through the secretary.
Yes, of course, I'm asking how many there are to know where to place them.
Okay, just tell me straight away so I would know.
So she could clean the room in time.
Also, could you advise how I can send a parcel to Ukraine? My daughter-in-law is due to give birth on the 6th and probably needs our help. She is alone at this time and I can't leave her without support, it's my only granddaughter.
Products, diapers.
I'm just going on leave on June 6th.
I was discharged from the maternity hospital for only 10 days.
I didn't manage to buy everything for the child.
There's no bedding yet, just a blanket.
So they should know I hope they will find the main thing is not to panic because right now I don't know what to do I'm ready to go and search myself but they won't let me into Donetsk there are heavy fights now and I don't know how the search will go it's hard.
So the last words I heard from him were that I'm a hard worker and it's good that I took my sisters and brothers, that they are safe.
I have to hold on, my children are what keep me going, they are my hope and support. I have nothing else but them, they are everything to me. I am happy that I have them.
My whole body is numb, I don't feel anything at all, it's good that I can still walk, this has never happened to me before.
Thank you, I can't go there today, another time is needed to calm down and gather my thoughts, there are a lot of thoughts.

How football teams from Ukraine and Russia fought in Turkey.

FC "Minai" confirms that this is a fresh photo from the latest training after the fight with the Russians.
A conflict occurred between the players of the Ukrainian football club "Minai" from the Premier League and the Russian "Shinnik" during a training camp in Antalya, Turkey.
The parties confirmed that there was a fight at the local hotel where both teams happened to be staying.
Initially, the conflict that occurred on February 13th was reported by Ukrainian and Russian media.
Then the fight was confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC "Minai", the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
Apparently, one of them was intoxicated and was bothering a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight really did take place, but it was on the floor where the Russians stopped, and in equal numbers.
The number of injured from "Shinnik" only confirms the fact that Russians really "throw" their own, - says the statement.
The club states that even after the skirmish ended, the Russians continued to fight amongst themselves, local police had to intervene.
"Before the start of the gathering, FC "Minai" main requirement to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to accommodate "Shinnik", according to the statement.
Football journalist Roman Bebekh, who was one of the first to report the situation on Twitter, posted a photo of the Ukrainian player who defended the employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that the conflict was provoked by Ukrainians.
In particular, the Baza telegram channel reports that representatives of "Minai" approached the players of Yaroslavl's "Shinnik" and started demanding them to sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians denied this.
"The numerical advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our boy.
The people of Yaroslavl stood up for him and defended him.
"There were five or six of us, there were many more Ukrainians," a source close to the Russian club told the "Kommersant" publication.
As a result, several Russian players sustained injuries.
"The Yaroslavl footballers were examined by a doctor, among the injuries - a cut lip, a broken toe and a suspected rib bruise," writes "Kommersant".
"I don't understand how Ukrainians could have ended up in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine," - the general director of "Shinnik" Sergey Kulakov was outraged in a comment to journalists.
Later, Kulakov told the Russian agency "RIA Novosti" that the Russians are leaving the hotel, but emphasized that they are not being evicted, they decided to leave on their own.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what do diabetes medications have to do with this?
7 minutes ago
Injections that are gaining popularity help to lose up to 15% of weight, but have many side effects.
In the UK, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy weight loss injections, used by some celebrities, including Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to manage obesity in type 2 diabetes.
Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large social media following, have admitted to using it.
The product is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other treatments for type 2 diabetes can indeed help with weight loss.
By affecting specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down food digestion.
As a result, a person feels hunger less often, gets satiated faster and consumes fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick fix and not a miracle cure that helps to lose weight without any effort.
The treatment is supervised by a specialist and is supported by diet and physical exercise.
Like any medication, Wegovy may have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or upset stomach, bloating and gas.
Moreover, rapid weight loss can lead to fat loss in the face, and in some people - to hollow cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
This effect doctors called "Ozempic face", from the name of another drug for treating diabetes, which is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors recommend taking Wegovy for no more than two years.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine have recaptured some lost positions.

In some areas of the front, the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to regain previously lost positions and secure them.
This was announced by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhny, during a conversation with the Chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhny, the most tense situation is currently in the Donetsk direction, where Russians carry out up to 50 attacks daily.
Fierce battles are ongoing in the area of Vuhledar and Marinka, where, according to Zaluzhny, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are holding the defense firmly.
"Despite the constant pressure from the enemy, we continue to keep Bahmut under control and are taking measures to stabilize the front line around this city," Zaluzhny reported.
In a conversation with General Milley, Zaluzhnyi shared his concern about Russia's use of surface maritime drones, which poses a threat to civilian shipping in the Black Sea.
Russian troops, after capturing Soledar, continue to tighten the ring around Bakhmut.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Sergey Shoygu, stated on February 7th that the situation near Bakhmut is "developing successfully" for his troops.
On February 11, the evening summary of the General Staff reported that Russia is reinforcing its troop grouping in the Liman and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and the night of February 11, Russians attacked critical infrastructure in several regions of Ukraine.
As reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from six o'clock in the evening on Friday until midnight, Ukrainian air defense systems destroyed two dozen "shahids", which the Russians launched from the eastern coast of the Azov Sea.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile strike against Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

EU to intensify sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
The European Union will impose new sanctions on Russia on the anniversary of its full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.
This was announced by the Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of the extraordinary EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU will support Ukraine "as long as it is necessary".
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries providing the most financial support to Kyiv.
"In terms of supplying weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone in continental Europe," he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized the "public auctions under the slogan: battle tanks, submarines, airplanes - who will demand even more".
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

He also promised to continue closely coordinating with partners supplying weapons to Kyiv.
Scholz reminded of the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022, about support on the path to European integration.
At the upcoming extraordinary summit, EU countries intend to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine's European path, he emphasized.
Ukraine belongs to Europe, and its future is within the European Union, added the Chancellor.

Mecola called for giving Kyiv fighter jets and long-range weapons - DW - 09.02.2023
The President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, during the meeting on Thursday, February 9, in which the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, spoke, called for providing Ukraine with aircraft and long-range weapons.
"EU member states must quickly consider, as the next step, providing long-range systems and fighters necessary for the protection of freedom, which many perceive as a given," said Metsola.
According to her, the response must be proportional to the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union," she said, addressing Zelensky.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
Zelensky, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on the path to EU membership.
"We are getting closer to the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
"A victorious Ukraine, a member of a victorious European Union," Zelensky stated in his speech before the European Parliament.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending against "the most anti-European force in the modern world".
"The Ukrainian European way of life is being attempted to be destroyed by total war.
But for what purpose?
To destroy the European way of life after the Ukrainian European lifestyle.
For each of the 27 elements of the European way of life, 27 countries of the European Union.
"We will not allow this," emphasized the President of Ukraine.
Zelensky will ask to expedite weapon deliveries.
On the eve, DW reported that Zelensky arrived in Brussels to gain the support of the European Council and expedite the provision of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As a source from Zelensky's frontline diplomatic team reminded the publication, during Zelensky's visit to the US at the end of last December, Kyiv received an "agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support, which was voted for by Congress".
"Therefore, the President of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally travels to other capitals," said the interlocutor.
The diplomat noted that, "of course, such decisions are not a matter for the Council of Europe, but for the member countries."
It is expected that Zelensky will voice Ukraine's needs for weapons during the Council of Europe summit and will personally communicate with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member countries.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine primarily needs long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia has begun a major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops have begun a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the west of the region has noticeably increased over the past week, according to the analysts' report for February 8.
It is also noted that geolocation footage of the combat confirmed Russian offensive successes in the Dvorichny area to the northwest of Svatovo.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine prevent Russia from achieving significant success.
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces have so far prevented Russian troops from achieving significant success.
ISW assumes that the RF offensive has not yet reached full pace, the Russian command has not yet put into action parts of the 2nd motorized rifle division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after deployment in Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in the Luhansk region currently hold the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces are setting the conditions of battle, ending a period of Ukrainian initiative since August 2022), full engagement of these forces may lead to their ultimate culmination on the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving the objectives of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions," the report says.
According to analysts' forecasts, this climax could potentially create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces, which they could use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning report, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Russian Federation's troops, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive actions in five directions: Kupyansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka in the areas of Kremenna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Marinka and Vuhledar.

"Of course, there will be attempts to advance both in the direction of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia," he said in an interview with Reuters.

SpaceX limited the ability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones through Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
On Thursday, February 9, Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, called on the American company SpaceX to clarify whether it supports Kyiv in the war initiated by Russia.
Thus, he responded to the information that Elon Musk's company has limited the ability of Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite internet system.
"Companies have to decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to a free life and Ukraine - and then they don't invent ways to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its "right" to killings, territorial seizures," - Podolyak wrote on Twitter.
Also read: "Peaceful proposals" by Elon Musk: how it was reacted in Ukraine and the world.
Starlink should not be a weapon.
On the eve, SpaceX's Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell stated that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army actively uses to counter Russian aggression, "was never intended to be used as a weapon".
"However, Ukrainians are using it in an unforeseen way, which is not part of any agreement.
We know that the military uses it for communication, and that's okay.
"But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes," the director is quoted by Reuters agency.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could "limit their ability to do this".
"There is what we can do, and have already done," she added.
The company refused to specify what measures it had taken.
SpaceX "negotiated" with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX provided Kyiv with free Starlink systems to ensure internet access for the population.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked it to take over this issue.
Then she estimated the necessary funding until the end of 2022 to be 120 million dollars, and approximately 400 million dollars over the next 12 months.
The issue of funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the US, as well as in the European Union, however, soon the owner of the company, Musk, announced that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US Department of Defense to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, believes that the relations between Berlin and Kyiv in the context of Russian aggression are developing "wave-like" - they have "ups and downs".
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
"By nature, I am a fast person.
"Others act more slowly, which may also be related to their bureaucracy," Zelensky noted, adding that in a war situation, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people's lives depend on the situation every minute.
Revitalization from PPO
The President of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage, Germany's "conservative attitude" changed and he received support from Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally received support from Steinmeier (President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I had previously had difficulties, especially due to the so-called "Steinmeier formula," - Zelensky noted.
He emphasized that "good work" had been done, which allowed to change the relations.
"We have received IRIS-T air defense systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
"They saved many lives," noted the President of Ukraine.
According to Zelensky's estimates, Berlin managed to increase the production rate of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to deliver three more IRIS-T systems to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate around the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kyiv has brought relations with Germany "into a difficult phase," noted the President of Ukraine.
He called the discussions on this matter "emotional and complex".
"I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is needed not for us, but for Europeans," Zelensky explained.
Categoricalness regarding exterminators
After the allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kyiv with battle tanks, discussions began about the transfer of fighter jets, which Ukraine insists on.
Here Scholz took a categorical position: Germany will under no circumstances transfer combat aircraft.
At the same time, the Chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv "as long as it is necessary".
He made similar statements both after the meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of European Union leaders on Thursday.

already nominated a new prime minister - DW - 10.02.2023
The Moldovan government, along with Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita, has resigned.
This decision was made after consultations with the country's president, Maia Sandu, Gavrilita announced on Friday, February 10th.
"After a year and a half of working in the government, it's time to announce my resignation.
"We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, fighting corruption and integration into the European Union," she stated.
According to her, during its tenure, the government "faced energy blackmail."
"They thought we would give up and act like previous governments that betrayed national interests, but that was not the case. We worked in a mode of continuous crisis," emphasized Havrylytsia.
She did not specify the reasons for her decision to resign, citing only a lack of "support and trust at home".
Sandu thanked the Prime Minister "for the enormous sacrifice and effort", also noting that Gavrilita led the government during a crisis period.
"Despite unprecedented challenges, the country was managed responsibly, with great attention and dedicated work.
"We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and bankruptcy," - stated the President of Moldova.

The new Prime Minister could be the Secretary of the Security Council.
According to the law, the cabinet of ministers will continue to perform their duties until the new government is sworn in.
To replace Gavrilita, Sandu has already proposed her security advisor, the current Secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and former Minister of Internal Affairs of the country, Dorin Recean.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, where the majority is held by the "Action and Solidarity" party.
Havrylytsia was her representative, so voting for Rechan should not be a problematic issue, notes AFP agency.
Rechan has already stated that he plans to continue pursuing Moldova's membership in the European Union.
According to him, the priorities of the new government will be "order and discipline, a breath of new life into the economy, as well as peace and stability," writes Reuters.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.
The country has twice experienced a complete power outage across the entire country due to Russian strikes on the Ukrainian power system.

In Turkey, in the region affected by underground tremors, almost 171 thousand tents have been set up.
According to official data, over one and a half million blankets have been sent to the disaster site.
Meanwhile, in Syria, representatives of the non-governmental organization "White Helmets", who carry out a rescue mission in rebel-controlled regions, complain about a lack of support.
On February 10, a representative of the "White Helmets" reported that only two small international volunteer teams, which do not have rescue equipment, have arrived in the region to provide assistance.
In addition, according to him, the region is not receiving any humanitarian aid from the UN.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which operates in London and reports on events from the rebel-controlled northern regions of Syria, noted that one batch of UN aid arrived in the region the day before, but it lacks tents for shelter and equipment for debris removal.
About three thousand "White Helmets" volunteers are involved in rescue operations in northern Syria.
According to their data, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people have been found, and over 3.3 thousand people are considered dead.
More than 10 thousand were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939.
Early in the morning on February 6, a powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.8 occurred in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria.
This earthquake was the most powerful in nearly a century of observations.
The last time Turkey experienced underground tremors of such magnitude was in 1939, when about 33 thousand people died.
In less than 12 hours, the southeast of Turkey was shaken by a second powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.5, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

The decisive round of presidential elections is taking place in Cyprus - DW - 12.02.2023
In the Republic of Cyprus, the second, decisive round of presidential elections is taking place on Sunday, February 12.
He was succeeded by the country's former Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulidis and former Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the UN Andreas Mavroyannis.
Conservative politician Christodoulidis received 32 percent of the votes in the first round, his opponent in the second round Mavroyanis, supported by the left forces, scored 29.6 percent, outpacing the leader of the ruling party "Democratic Rally" (DISY) Averof Neofitu.
The DISY party, after the defeat of its candidate in the first round, could not decide who to support, making the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, notes AFP agency.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by general vote.
He forms and leads the government of the country.
The winner of the current election will hold the position of the head of state for five years and will become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of a coup supported by the Greek junta, and subsequent intervention by the Turkish army.
In 1983, the northern sector of the island occupied by the Turks declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Ankara.
The latest negotiations on the attempt to reunify Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots - about 560 thousand people - participate in the elections.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote in them.

"Energoatom" reported a new threat to ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
The President of NNEGC "Energoatom" Petro Kotin called the reduction of water by the Russians in the Kakhovka reservoir a new threat to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).
"Many threats at ZNPP.
"The lowering of water in the Kakhovka reservoir is a newly added threat," Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that as of the evening of February 11, the reservoir level is 13.8 meters with a normal level of 16 meters, "so that the station receives replenishment for its generators, for the condensers of turbines and for safety systems".
"In recent days, we have seen that the level has stabilized and is slightly increasing, because it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m," Interfax-Ukraine quotes Kotin.
He explained that the Russians, who control the sluices at the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station, have started to release less water, while the inflow upstream of the Dnieper has increased.
The President of "Energoatom" clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at ZNPP is sufficiently filled and there is enough water for now, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, this, in his words, "will be a big problem for ZNPP".
Kotin emphasized that the critical level will be 12 meters, the emergency level - 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will not allow a critical situation.

Israel to intensify campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to intensify its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, announced on Sunday, February 12, the country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
"Today the government is meeting to prepare for an even broader response to those who carry out terrorism," Netanyahu is quoted by Reuters.
Such a statement followed after a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, resulting in the death of three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
Police shot a man at the scene and also arrested and interrogated family members of the Palestinian.
Israeli law enforcement sealed the doors and windows of a Palestinian family's house.
The next step after sealing could be the demolition of the attacker's house, reports AP.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot dead during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians launched a rocket towards the Israeli border on Saturday evening.
The Israeli army stated that the missile was intercepted, reports dpa.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army conducts almost daily raids on the West Bank of the Jordan River, leading to numerous clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, there have been reports of 45 Palestinians killed during or in the course of their own attacks.
In addition, as a result of Palestinian attacks in 2023, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman were killed.
According to human rights defenders, in 2022, about 150 Palestinians were killed on the West Bank of the Jordan River and in East Jerusalem, making this year the deadliest in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, last year 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis, AP reports.
Israel conquered the West Bank of the Jordan River and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, over 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, dpa notes.

Greek Foreign Minister visits Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - long-time opponents, writes on Sunday, February 12, dpa.
On the same day, the foreign ministers of the two countries, Nikos Dendias and Mevlut Cavusoglu, held an unexpected meeting, during which, as captured by Greek television cameras, they even embraced.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara.
Cavusoglu thanked Dendias for Greece being one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the natural disaster.
He added that both states will try to restart dialogue and solve their problems.
"The assistance of Greece to the Turkish people does not end here," emphasized the head of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to him, Athens will "do everything" - bilaterally, as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit the disaster area.
Several Greek rescue teams are operating in the Antakya and Hatay region.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
Political commentators and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope for several days that the aid Athens provided to Ankara could mark a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members have already demonstrated solidarity with each other during the strong earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This aid, known as "earthquake diplomacy", helped to achieve a certain easing of tensions at that time.
Conflict over the islands
Athens and Ankara have been arguing over sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean for decades.
Ankara questions Greece's sovereignty over a series of islands in the eastern part of the Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos, and Kos.
Greece seems to be violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous landing ships on the Turkish western coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
Also read: Are Greece and Turkey on the brink of armed conflict?
Turkey almost daily reinforces its claims by flying fighters over Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country's leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade Greek islands.
Ankara's warming relations with Armenia.
Amid the tragedy caused by earthquakes, there is also a warming of relations between Turkey and Armenia.
Ankara has opened a crossing that had been closed for over 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia for disaster victims have passed.
In addition, Armenia reported sending two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria following the earthquake that occurred on February 6, claiming the lives of over 33,000 people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are tense due to historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians fell victim to systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
As the successor to the Ottoman Empire, Turkey acknowledges that it exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define this as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide has been condemned by the USA, Germany, and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Amid the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation only became more complicated.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
In Brussels, a two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers has begun, within which a meeting in the so-called "Ramstein" format is also being held on Tuesday, February 14th.
On the agenda of the event - further increasing support for Ukraine in the war and increasing the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated before the meeting that NATO must provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war".
"We see no signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensive actions and new attacks," Reuters quotes him as saying.
"This is a war of attrition, therefore, a battle for logistics," added Stoltenberg, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations on the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.
Also read: The head of the Munich Conference opposes "red lines" in aid to Ukraine.
It is expected that during the meeting, the ministers will approve long-term methodological recommendations for the Alliance's defense planning.
"Allies will discuss investing in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure," Interfax-Ukraine quotes Stoltenberg.
What to expect from the ninth "Rammstein"
On the same day, the US-led Contact Group is meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, with the participation of Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.
Also, the head of the Ukrainian defense department will join a special session of the NATO defense ministers' meeting.
"Over 50 participating countries of the Contact Group stand united with you in this fight for Ukraine's sovereignty and self-defense," wrote Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin on Twitter, posting a video of his meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership had previously expressed hope that at the next "Ramstein" meeting, partners could make a decision to provide Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that as a result of this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and terms of providing tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants a ban on tours of Russian artists in the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine is collecting data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policy of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations funded by the Russian state budget, in order to include them in a new EU sanctions package.
This was reported in an interview with DW by the Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, Galyna Hryhorenko.
Culture, as Russia's weapon
As Grigorenko emphasized, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and to justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum clearly states that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their "special operation," says Hryhorenko.
In her opinion, a dialogue with Russia through culture is currently impossible.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
Yes, recently the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a trusted person of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DNR" in Donbass.
Also read: Ukrainian artists refuse to perform on the same stage with Anna Netrebko.
EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour.
However, according to Grygorenko, this is not enough and those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin's policy still manage to tour in Europe.
"To officially cancel such tours, you need to have surnames in European sanction lists," says Hryhorenko, adding, "We are working on making Russian cultural figures who promote Russian narratives beyond Russia's borders part of the next sanction package."
This will allow the EU to officially ban their economic activities on its territory, including holding concerts".
According to Hryhorenko, this issue in Ukraine is being addressed by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, and a special working group at the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As previously reported, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, at a joint press conference with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Brussels on February 9, noted that he asked her at the summit in Kyiv to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists.
She promised that many propagandists will be included in the sanction list of the tenth package.
In Ukraine, there is a sanctions list of Russian cultural and media figures, which contains more than 300 surnames.
Famous "voices" of Ukraine's monuments destroyed by RF
The USA is ready to sell Poland HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment for 10 billion dollars.
The US State Department has approved a possible sale of military equipment and services to Poland for an amount of about 10 billion dollars.
This was reported by Voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin, citing the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
This primarily refers to the launchers of the highly mobile artillery rocket system M142 HIMARS with ammunition for them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such a purchase should support the foreign policy and national security goals of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe," the Agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment "for the modernization of its armed forces and the expansion of its capabilities for strengthening internal defense and deterring regional threats".
Overall, Poland has submitted a request for the purchase of such equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of HIMARS loader module;
- 45 M57 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of the guided multiple launch rocket system GMLRS (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
The agreement also includes missiles, communication equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and equipping personnel, system integration support, engineering and logistical services of the US government and contractors, training, sensors, other related elements of hardware and software.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is an addition to the launchers purchased by Poland from the US in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw has also requested missile systems from South Korea, the publication reports.
NATO Secretary General urged the US to be prepared for a long war with Russia in Ukraine.
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine for defense in the war against Russia is not off the table, stated the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak, during a press conference with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.
"The first step in providing advanced aircraft is having soldiers or aviators who are capable of using them.
This is a process that requires some time.
"We started this process today," Sunak said about the previously announced program of training Ukrainian pilots in the UK.
- Nothing has been removed from the agenda, and our leadership in this matter is something we should all be proud of."
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks will arrive in Ukraine "next month" and stated that Ukraine "should never again remain vulnerable to attack", as well as calling to "arm Ukraine in the short term, but strengthen Ukraine in the long term".
According to him, the UK has agreed to expand its training program, which has prepared 10,000 servicemen over the past six months, and promised, as CNN writes, "to accelerate the delivery of our equipment" to ensure Ukraine's achievement on the front line in the coming "days and weeks, not years".
During a press conference, President Zelensky expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: "Today it is clear that we have the support of Great Britain.
Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity".
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he reiterated the call for providing Ukraine with Western fighters and added that he "heard from the Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighters" to Kyiv.
The Russian embassy in London has already stated that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military-political consequences" for the entire world.
Today, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba stated on Twitter that Kyiv continues to discuss with Western partners the possibility of providing combat aircraft: "I spoke with Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra to coordinate our international steps, as Russia's full-scale invasion approaches the one-year mark.
I thanked for the last decision about the tanks.
I also raised the issue about F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others regarding combat aviation."
The spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force, Yuriy Ignat, in a comment for CNN, stated that Ukraine would need dozens of Western fighter jets to win the war against Russia.
Meanwhile, observers say that the West has a small window of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the expected new Russian offensive in the spring or even in February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin is already trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since the beginning of January.

"Politics and profits" are hindering vaccination.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization stated on Sunday that if countries do not effectively use existing tools to combat the pandemic, it will not be possible to end it.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the necessary tools - effective health protection measures and effective medical instruments.
"But the world has misused these tools," said Tedros, addressing participants from 100 countries.
"Politics and profits" are the obstacles to achieving the WHO's goal of vaccinating 40% of the population of each country against the coronavirus, said the WHO director, "not production".
"Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue in favor of COVAX and the African vaccine acquisition fund," said Tedros.
COVAX is an international cooperative initiative created for the equitable distribution of the COVID vaccine.
Ghebreyesus also emphasized that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperating to protect other peoples.
"Together!" - noted Gebreyesus on the social network Twitter.
The official WHO representative also urged vaccine manufacturers to "prioritize and fulfill their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [African Vaccine Acquisition Trust]" and to become "much more transparent about where things are going".
AVAT is an initiative of the African Union, aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to "exchange know-how, technologies and licenses and to waive intellectual property rights."
Earlier, Karen Attia, a contributor to The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share the "recipe" for the Moderna vaccine with the world.
"The US administration has trumpeted about the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a wealthy country resorts to vaccine donations instead of spreading knowledge, it's not benevolent philanthropy; it's superiority.
"Poorer countries didn't ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they asked for fair opportunity from the start," the reviewer noted.
"We are not asking for charity," said Tedros, "we are calling for smart investments in global recovery."
As reported by "Voice of America", earlier this year the Biden administration called for a waiver of patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
Such a refusal is intended, according to the US administration, to allow poorer countries to produce generic versions of patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical companies, the EU, and others were against it.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced a price increase for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Resource Center on Coronavirus at Johns Hopkins University reported on Monday that it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, nearly 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

The President of Poland, Andrzej Duda, stated that the decision to send F-16 planes to Ukraine would be a "very serious decision" that is "not easy to make".
One of Ukraine's closest allies stated this in an interview with CNN amidst discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
As reported by CNN correspondent Laura Kuenssberg, in an exclusive interview in Warsaw that will air on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16 planes will create a "serious problem" for Poland, because the Polish Air Force has less than 50 planes, and the Poles themselves "do not have enough... and we will need many more".
Also, Duda emphasized that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have a "very serious need for maintenance", so "it's not enough to just send a few planes".
These remarks by President Duda came against the backdrop of discussions on new arms supplies to Ukraine, including Western tanks and older anti-missile systems.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has been persistently persuading its NATO allies to send Patriot systems and Western-made tanks, such as German Leopard tanks, to Kyiv.
This week, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, undertook an unannounced European tour, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with means to combat Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelensky called combat aviation the "wings of freedom" for Ukraine.
This is the message Zelensky repeated in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelensky said that he is "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hopes that the upcoming negotiations on providing Ukraine with aviation will also be successful.
"I have heard from some European leaders about their readiness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
Right now, I have a series of bilateral talks, we will be raising the issue of fighters and other aviation.
"Therefore, we continue our work here, in Brussels," said Zelensky.
As reported by "Voice of America", last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that his country is ready to transfer its F-16 fighters to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, the Dutch Foreign Minister Vopke Hoekstra said his government would consider Kyiv's request for F-16s.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied the supply of F-16 aircraft from the US, but Western experts believe that these aircraft can be supplied to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that previously, weapons that the US refused to supply ultimately ended up in Ukraine, if their NATO European allies agreed to transfer them.

CHISINAU, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, the President of Moldova claimed a Moscow conspiracy to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country "at Russia's disposal" and thwart its aspirations to join the European Union.
The briefing of President Maia Sandu took place a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that his country intercepted plans of Russian special services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by representatives of Moldovan intelligence.
"The plan for the next period involves the involvement of saboteurs with military training, disguised in civilian clothes, who will resort to forceful actions, attack some government buildings, and even take hostages," Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The goal of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to replace the legitimate power of Chisinau with an illegitimate one," Sandu said, "which would put our country at the disposal of Russia and halt the process of European integration."
She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed".
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.6 million people, has been trying to establish closer relations with its Western partners.
In June of last year, she received the status of a candidate for the European Union, the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that from October to December, the Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several cases of criminal elements organization and stopped attempts of violence".
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a NATO member, has faced a number of problems.
Among them are a serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply cut gas supplies; soaring inflation; and several incidents over the past few months involving missiles crossing airspace and debris found on its territory.
The Moldovan government confirmed that another war-era missile from Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu stated that Russia wants to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information received by the special services contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry into Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that state institutions are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control," Sandu said.
She said that the Moldovan parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the prosecution, with "necessary tools for a more effective fight against risks to the country's security".
The President added that the plan will "rely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups," and continued to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are currently in exile.
Last year, both men were sanctioned by the US and the UK.
Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shor party also shook Moldova amid an energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday took place after the Prime Minister of Moldova, Natalia Gavrilita, resigned on Friday.
That same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security advisor, pro-Western economist Dorin Recean, as Gavrilita's successor.
On Friday, after the Moldovan authorities confirmed a missile incident, Vedant Patel, Deputy Spokesperson for the US State Department, told reporters in Washington that "Russia has for years supported influence campaigns and destabilization in Moldova, which often involve the use of corruption as a weapon to achieve its goals."

Stories from the war: "Grandma with the red flag" threw it away when she learned about Bucha.
An employee of the Center for Strategic Communications found the same woman.
üîª The living symbol of "pro-Russian Ukraine", a woman who, according to Russian propaganda, "bravely opposed nationalists", is actually grateful to Ukrainian soldiers, who not only support her with food, but also protected her from the anger of ordinary Kharkiv residents.
üîª Anna Ivanivna explains that she went out with a red flag to, as she thought, Russian soldiers, so they "would not smash Ukraine".
And in the aggressor country, her motives were twisted, making her now feel like a "traitor".
üîª She is currently in one of the city hospitals in Kharkiv with her husband.
üí¨ The military urges not to disrespect the old woman.
"Now, when Anna Ivanivna received a mine in her yard from the Russians, and help from the Ukrainians, her grandson is being saved in Poland, when she learned about Bucha and everything else, she threw that red flag far away," says the squad leader with the pseudonym "Cadet".
The enemy is creating conditions for an offensive on Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih - report
Russian military forces are conducting combat operations to reach the administrative borders of the Kherson region and create favorable conditions for advancing on the cities of Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih.

Literally: "To increase the pace of the offensive operation, the command of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continues to take measures to strengthen the strike potential of its troops.
The equipment and military hardware removed from storage in the Western, Central, Eastern military districts and the northern fleet are being transported to the regions bordering Ukraine by rail.
Details: On the Volyn and Polissya directions, the enemy did not conduct active actions.
No significant changes have occurred in the situation on the indicated directions.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
There remains a threat of the enemy launching missile strikes on military and civilian infrastructure across the entire territory of Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as the enemy carrying out provocations along the mentioned section of the state border of Ukraine.
We are abandoning Soviet weapons and switching to NATO models - Zaluzhny
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhny, had a phone conversation with the Chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to native models of weapons.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
Direct speech of Zaluzhny: "We also discussed with my American colleague the prospective model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO standards.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will finish.
I also informed General Milley about the difficult situation in the east of our country, especially in the Izium and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite all the complexity of the situation, we ensure defense, maintain occupied lines and positions".
- "Whoever invented this hellish summer was clearly out of their mind!" complained Wildrose, stretching her hands out in front of her as if trying to reach some phantom coolness.
"You say the same thing every time," Varta noted indifferently, stirring the ice in her cocktail. "In the fall - because of the rain and gloom, the grass rots."
In winter - because it's cold and the grass freezes.
In spring ‚Äî because it's raining again...
-"She would have sat in her Carpathians," Varta shrugged indifferently.
Even though she didn't particularly like the city.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and turmoil.
The girl liked to imagine familiar streets as calm, quiet, and greener, like a hundred years ago or even earlier.
But there is no magic that would allow to go back in time.
- Phew!
"You'd say that!" - The wild woman slapped the table - and the vases with flowers timidly jingled. - "If you had spent a week on the mountain pasture at my grandmother Rutmera's with her colleagues, you would pray for every passing truck to take you away from there to any city."
Unless you loved to hoe the beds from morning till night, sort out the herbs, hang them under the ceiling and sing ancient incantations while doing so.
Because grandma insisted that without words, none of my potions would be as they should be.
And wait, I haven't even mentioned the rummaging through all sorts of junk at night!..
Oh, our dear white-handed one, you would have died, not even a week would have passed!
Through such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, and that they like such "work", that it is their conscious choice and so on.
But if you really start to delve into this topic, it becomes scary...
Currently, the issue of Ukrainian women being drawn into prostitution is particularly acute.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea to legalize prostitution... because of this, I didn't have a very good opinion of him.
I think we need to adopt the experience of Sweden, they have a unique "Swedish model".
In this case, it's not the woman who is being ordered around, but the client.
Women are helped to get out of this "business", not to make it legal.
Legalization does not necessarily mean safety and social guarantees.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, as there is no longer hope for anything else.
Men should also consider what they are buying - "pleasure" or violence...
I need something else... could you find me the nearest optician with a doctor who can prescribe glasses.
And you need to buy a quality frame... I looked at some websites with frames, and I was pleasantly surprised - it's cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about 300 dollars for them, the frame was of average quality (or even lower).
I don't know what frames are in the stores, but the prices in online stores are quite reasonable.
But as for some cosmetics, I can definitely say that it's more expensive here.
Still a lot more.
Multifocal lenses for glasses are very expensive for us (if compared with our average salaries).
Considering our family's budget (especially the fact that we have to rent a house), $300 for glasses is quite a high amount.
Did the doctors not suggest an artificial multifocal lens to you?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then I started to have lens intolerance, a year after that I wore hard lenses, I started to have a strong allergy to almost all cosmetic products.
I've been wearing glasses constantly for 4 years, I rarely wear lenses.
Yes, I also read that Covid affects vision.
Also, after 40 years there is a need for reading glasses.
My mom was offered multifocal glasses, the price was over 1000 dollars, which is very very expensive.
Yes, glasses are fashionable now.
I asked a doctor why he doesn't wear lenses or get laser correction, and he replied that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of 1500 UAH - this amount is unreal.
Right now my glasses are hiding wrinkles.
Yes.
My mom has little work experience.
She worked little: first small children who often get sick, then she took care of her grandmother... so the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father receives 3800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8000 hryvnias and all this money had to be paid for rent.
In good times (before Covid), there were bonuses, but with the onset of quarantine, there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
That's why many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for their family or buy an apartment, but then they lose connection with their family...
Yes, there are advantages.
But when my husband has a day off, he still goes to the apiary)
Goodnight
According to the order from the day of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until control over the mentioned seaports is restored.
It is stated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the impossibility of servicing vessels and passengers, ensuring an adequate level of navigation safety and environmental protection during the conduct of military operations by Russia in these regions, which pose a threat to human life and health.
The Russian Federation uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
As reported by Ukrinform correspondent, this is stated by Reuters, referring to the statement of the UK Foreign Office.
"The UK Foreign Office stated on Sunday that Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including the UK and South Africa," the article says.
It is noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reached these conclusions based on expert research.
"The agency stated that this study exposed how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign operates, aimed at manipulating international public opinion regarding the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers," Reuters reports.
According to the research, the troll factory "used Telegram to recruit and coordinate new supporters, who later acted against Kremlin critics, bombarding them with comments in support of President Putin and his war."
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
"The traces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including: Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok," the statement said.
The UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss stated in this regard that her government has already "warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations."
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadowy troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war," concluded Tras.
Ivanna, I will explain to you now.
You have such a hair structure that all the hair is practically the same length.
Very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest result, you need to either do hair thinning.
But this will greatly affect the density of the hair.
That's why I didn't do it.
Or do root coloring to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I also did not dye the roots.
Therefore, the transition might be a bit abrupt.
I can smooth your transition, but we will need to embellish the roots.
The roots will be dyed to match your color, so when the hair grows back you will not notice a difference.
Regarding hair quality.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of hair.
Hair can become drier, it's normal because it's blonde.
It's impossible to achieve such blonde without losing quality.
If you take proper care of your hair, the condition of your hair will return to normal.
Please write, which Matrix care you use.
Perhaps, it's too weak for a blonde.
We can book a free toning session to make a smoother transition.
This photo also has a quite sharp transition.
Because there is a high percentage of blonde in the root zone.
Please write when you could come, so I could take a look.
If we do tinting, it will take about three hours.
I get a lot of positivity from what I do at my work.
I help people - that's the most important thing and that's what I strive for.
Even in such a way, but it is help to people who almost no one in the world helps and will not say with a smile of the heart "good day".
Found some great basic Czech language lessons on the internet today.
I clean the rooms where the homeless sleep in the morning, at this time I am alone and the doors to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons in my headphones and repeat after the lecturer.
I talk to myself from the side, but it's good that no one sees or hears me at this time üòÖ I think I can learn the language like this for an hour a day.
So another huge positive of this job is learning the language through headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ
Over the last hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
The longest peaceful period lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
Most of the modern territory of Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural foundation of the Russians.
The cult of conquest and raids has been successful throughout the history of Russia: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then - 20 years of Putin's regime.
These cultural peculiarities have shaped state institutions that cultivate policies of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of aggressive wars, as they believe their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
Russians have not yet fully felt the effects of economic sanctions.
The standard of living in them has not deteriorated to the extent that it would provoke mass protest movements within the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand the intensification of sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia is creating the threat of a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
Russian military forces are shelling and seizing nuclear power plants on Ukrainian territory.
The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant has been de-energized.
They shelled with tanks and took control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant - the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were detected over the South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant in Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia is violating Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacking nuclear power plants.
A missile strike, overheating of the reactor or spent fuel due to failures in electricity and water supply can lead to a radiation leak.
There are 15 nuclear reactors located in Ukraine.
Russia doesn't necessarily have to press the "red button" to cause a planetary-scale disaster.
Support Ukraine - the Russian threat can only be overcome together!
Russians are robbing Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural machinery, and first crops from Ukraine.
Such cases have been recorded in four regions of Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a deliberate policy of Russia: for example, the local government of the Krasnoyarsk region has made a decision about the "expropriation of surplus harvests of the past and this year" from the south of Ukraine.
The occupational authority takes away the sowing material from the farmers, but at the same time demands them to successfully carry out the sowing, in order to then send the new crops to Russia.
Prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement - threatens physical punishment.
Russia is repeating the USSR's policy of mass looting of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
This is how the Holodomor began in 1932-33 and private property was destroyed on Ukrainian lands.
Under the guise of a "liberation war against the Nazis", Russia is provoking famine in the occupied territories and destroying Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country refuse any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine are taking children hostage.
They force their mothers to disclose the locations of Ukrainian military forces, and if they refuse, they threaten to kill their children.
People are pushed to a harsh choice: to lose their children or to betray their homeland and suffer the punishment for it.
The Human Rights Ombudsman in Ukraine, Lyudmila Denisova, has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphaned children by the aggressor state.
They are taken to Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated a change in legislation "to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbas".
Urge your government and the international community not to allow the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don't like their indecisiveness.
Thousands are dying because NATO does not close the sky over Ukraine.
More than 50,000 civilians have been killed.
However, without Western weapons we would be powerless, but I have to say that they are coming in insufficient quantities and with delay.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I guess it's beneficial for the alliance itself, as with NATO weaponry and 9 years of war experience against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe.
Did you know that Ukrainians invented how to recharge the "disposable" anti-tank system nlaw?
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage.
Russians deserve the worst and most terrible things one can imagine.
So in some way, I'm glad about what's happening.
Because this war has not been going on for 4 months, it started around the 15th century, I can't remember exactly right now.
But for hundreds of years, there has been an attempt to make us their slaves.
One generation barely has time to die before another is born and takes up the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have come back to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time, Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state.
It's wildly strange for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But due to the rapid unfolding of events, I didn't even have time to comprehend, to reflect on the fact that there is a war going on and what it means to me.
It's great here, but I need to learn the language and go to work. I can't rely on the Czech state for support, but the problem is that my husband doesn't want me to work. We constantly argue about it. We might have to go back to Ukraine, even though we could stay here, but he will do everything to make us go back. It's a very complicated situation.
He doesn't want us to live here, that's his answer.
He is glad that we are here but wants us to stay home all the time. I myself took the children to school and swimming, I ask that we stay here after the war but he says that we will go home immediately, he will not make documents for us.
I probably won't be able to leave if he has a long job, and he may not give permission for the children to be taken to the Czech Republic.
Long stay
I want to study to become a hairdresser when the war ends, and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic. If he doesn't want to, then we will probably have to go to a lawyer. It's too early to do anything now. But he clearly told us that we are going home immediately after the war.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine he said he would take us))) well now I know the truth.
Yes. Thank you. We will get through this situation, the main thing is for the war to end!!! Everything will be fine.!!!
No, at the moment he definitely doesn't have anyone. I think the reason is that children want a lot in the Czech Republic, they ask him for toys, to go to McDonald's, they scream, run around the house. He is used to peace, that no one bothers him and asks for nothing. But we came and everything annoys him and he has to spend money on us and he is very economical. So it's better for him if we live in Ukraine.
Outside the train window, birch and fir groves dusted with a fine grey drizzle were flashing by, sprinkled with black-and-white confetti of magpies, mournful water towers and freight cars.
The Comrade Authorized by the Orlov was lying on a narrow Spartan bed, familiar to him, as it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed at his home.
He unpacked a simple set of provisions - rye bread and lard, wrapped in a grey rag.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and unpretentious in life, he had long forgotten how people rejoice in life and have fun so simply, because he only did what was beneficial to the country and the world revolution.
Then he leaned over the old, worn-out satchel and carefully removed with both hands the crystal dome that dimly sparkled in the grey light of the middle band.
- "What is that you have, comrade?" - the young cadet, his neighbor, asked fearfully.
- "A rarity," said Comrade Orlov with an unexpected tenderness, securely placing the skull on the compartment table, "such a thing... Very interesting and engaging thing."
This, you could say, is my little friend‚Ä¶
Yes, I am looking for work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately, I find jobs for men, for special education.
I don't know Czech, I am a teacher of small children, I am not an engineer and I don't have a driver's license.
And also, finding accommodation is a big question.
I am abroad for the first time and I just don't know what to do and how to act.
I haven't been able to find a job for a month, I only cleaned in one house.
I understand that the situation in Prague is very difficult, so I'm not even going there.
I'm having problems everywhere here üò≠ it's my first time abroad, I don't know the language and I'm completely alone.
The agency laid me off along with 20 other people after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find a job anymore.
I ask people, I look at websites - nothing.
I am attending a course in this village.
One lesson per week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, the situation is such that I have to stick to free accommodation while it's available.
And to watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options ((
I don't want to just sit around because the accommodation won't be free for long.
I understand
I don't want to take your money.
I don't want thoughts about lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in a regular city, not in the capital.
The difficult journey from Ukraine, three days and a big city where a foreign language is spoken, scared me a lot.
I didn't come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save a life.
I just need a job and a room.
Perhaps you know someone in small towns?
I can take care of children, cook, clean, work in the garden...
I know how to sew, I have training to sew on a sewing machine.
I sewed custom-made bed linen and some clothes.
Such a job may be possible.
I can do this!
Hugging and sending greetings to everyone!! üôèüèªü§óü§óü§óüíêüåû
Very happy to read you!
We are having an air raid alarm again(((
Today, more than 100 rockets arrived in Ukraine üò°
I worked with the wounded today, so it was hard to concentrate.
All thoughts were with the child.
Jan was homeschooled...
Everything will be Ukraine!
We cast out this filth!
In the surgical department, I volunteer with colleagues.
Sometimes it gets overwhelming of course))))
Then I clean, cook, socialize))))
Because this is my home, my land!
Send greetings to everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for understanding, support and love! üôèüèªüíêü§ó
Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the issue of whether or not to exclude the association of Russian psychologists from European associations is very complex.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is paramount.
I'll give an analogy.
If one child takes another child's toy in the sandbox, most likely the adults watching the children will try to reconcile the children and after a while the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox starts hitting another in the face with a shovel, that child is isolated for a long time and no one will play with them.
I also liked the analogy of one Russian colleague-psychologist about the fact that when someone from a neighboring apartment kills someone, the whole apartment building is not put in jail.
Among Ukrainian psychologists, there are many discussions on the topic of excluding Russian associations from European ones, many feel so much pain that they cannot withstand communication with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sorrow about the war in Ukraine but I am ready to continue cooperating with several psychologists from Russia, whom I know, and share knowledge in order to treat the traumas of clients from both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who are trying at their level to do a lot for the development of universal human values in Russia.
Therefore, I am definitely for a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia, 5-10% of the population supports the war, and the other figures in the polls are inflated by propaganda.
My wife left her native country Ukraine because there is a war going on there.
The wife had a good job and if not for the war, she would never have left her home.
In order not to be a burden in the Czech Republic, my wife is trying to earn money, as she once received a certificate of completion of massage courses in Ukraine in 2009.
In the Czech Republic, everyone also earns money as best they can.
The only problem now is to learn the Czech language.
While the wife learns languages and works, earning money for herself and the child for food, for kindergarten, for a bus ticket, for mobile services, for clothes.
And at this time, I am defending my homeland.
Thank you for the support to the people who understand this.
Thank you to the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine during difficult times. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáøü§ù‚úä
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to place an advertisement for my wife's massage services in your community.
The wife earns money by her own efforts because she does not want to live off the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you
I am sincerely grateful to you.
This really helps my wife earn money for her family.
Okay, I will tell my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of Ukrainian people.
Some people laugh at my wife's advertisement, but my wife offers her services.
My wife in Ukraine was a nurse, I work in the police but the war separated us.
It's good that my wife wants to work and earn money instead of waiting for help from your republic.

I really need a person who could act as a translator in a Czech insurance company.
On our way to the Czech Republic, while we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we are dealing with the insurance company to fix the car.
Strakhova asked for a person who can translate from Czech to Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa during the technical inspection of the car.
Can you help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific paper based on the statistical analysis of body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a separate population.
In addition, I also have experience working in fields closely related to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in the research of the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped conduct monitoring of bat populations in the Kharkiv region, as well as organize hibernation for bats that were disturbed by people during the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my audience communication skills and learned how to engage others in a topic important to me, biodiversity conservation.
In the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to familiarize myself with scientific works about tardigrades, observe their life activity under a microscope, and communicate with scientists who study them.
So, the option of studying these and other microscopic organisms in more depth also interests me.
How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed and why the EU is not paying for refugees - analysis from an expert.
Poland and the Czech Republic are not receiving refugee aid from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milo≈° Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the resolution of many problems.
She provided shelter for 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
Approximately 500 thousand arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such strong support from neighbors - Poland and the Czech Republic - and will tirelessly thank!
How Poland is coping with the unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, ProUkraine editorial team asked Yaroslav Kot - coordinator and translator of the Refugee Center in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analytics, which has representation not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic has accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and it has significantly affected the lives of the Czechs.
There are long queues at the employment offices, significant price increases in the stores.
What is happening in Poland, where millions of Ukrainian refugees are?
The Polish government exceptionally quickly organized and began providing assistance when military actions started.
This was anticipated.
In Poland, they have been saying for the past few months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, there was less preparation for what was to happen, while in Poland, there was active preparation.
For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the war began, there were certain plans on where to accommodate refugees from Ukraine.
In Ukraine, they didn't even think that such a thing could happen.
I heard that they were laughing about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very calculated: preparing for all these events even before the war began.
I should note, extraordinarily large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to assist Ukrainians fleeing from bombings, from the Russian aggressor.
First and foremost, assistance in logistics - moving around the territory of Poland.
From Ukraine to Poland, there are special trains, including medical ones, for the wounded and sick.
These are airplanes that travel across Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I have had experience working with flights to Portugal, France, Romania, and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, not a million-plus city as someone might think.
The transportation issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, the fare for Ukrainians has been cancelled.
They can ride for free on trains and public transportation.
In addition, Poland has arranged with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
This means that refugees have the opportunity to travel for free to the places where they plan to stop.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local government bodies.
Mostly these are closed small school stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are set up.
There, free meals and free first aid medical assistance are provided.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and from there, opportunities are sought for them to move to more comfortable conditions.
The big cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been established.
The example of Warsaw is unique in the sense that they managed to get the Russian embassy to take over the properties that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes stood neglected for decades, but the Russians didn't let anyone in.
The Polish local authority nationalized it, so to speak.
Took for the benefit of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
Water and electricity will be supplied there, they will be insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine may already be living there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm adopted, and the Senate approved, a law regarding refugees from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all European Union countries.
This law provides for medical services.
Additionally, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medical aid to Ukrainians.
You just need to send a text message and receive a code on your phone.
And to get medicines for free in Poland when converted to 5,000 hryvnias.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are given unconditionally to every refugee from Ukraine regardless of age.
Various funds are widespread, including Caritas, Red Cross, which provide packages with food, chemicals, clothing.
As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".
That is, "an event without analogues".
Such immense openness.
For the Polish state, this is a huge expense.
The European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland to date.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
Language problem.
The issues start from the clinics, where Ukrainians can't manage without a translator.
Often with complex problems, diseases.
The second problem - schools, where students, especially older ones, initially struggle and cannot understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often arrive with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children not only have a good command of English, but their overall level is higher than the class they are placed in.
This is also interesting.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, actually, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, a worker who worked as a doctor, accountant, or lawyer in Ukraine will find it much harder to master this job here.
As a lawyer or accountant, I don't know of any such cases.
Doctors are now appearing at certain points, including in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to treat the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.
The language barrier is often the reason that prompts families to return home after a few weeks of staying here.
There are many such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have had a wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are returning back.
This is Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military actions.
Here they did not adapt, did not find work.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and therefore it is more convenient for them to return home.
This is also one of those problems that has arisen in the last few weeks.
How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed
Significant changes have occurred according to the ambassador of Ukraine in the Czech Republic.
If before, Czech society considered Ukrainians solely as labor migrants, now it takes pride in the resilience of Ukrainians who are defending their country.
How do Poles feel about millions of Ukrainian refugees?
There is a similar situation in Poland.
Here all television channels often quote the statement of the President of Poland, Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When the events of Russia's attack on Georgia took place, he was in Tbilisi along with President Yushchenko and other state leaders.
There he uttered the significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then it could be Ukraine.
Then it could be the Baltic countries, it could even reach Poland.
In other words, he somehow foresaw it.
In fact, Ukrainians are currently defending Poland with their blood, their dedication, their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Polish people appreciate this, therefore they open their homes and selflessly help Ukrainian refugees.
They see a threat in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war could also knock on our door.
That's why the attitude has changed to positive.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem are now in Poland not a "song of nationalists" or some enemies.
Of course, there remain small groups among the population who have not changed their views, they exist in every country.
But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think very differently about Ukrainians than before.
The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is funny.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly claim that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
This is simply laughed at in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they have no political subtext.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those layers of society that still had doubts about some historical issues.
Now it turns out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
When Poles start to think that there could be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is happening now in Ukraine.
Here they constantly talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, as a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously considering their own safety.
Russia threatens to strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How does the government and society of Poland react?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland is doing this, it has very good contacts with the USA, other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
Currently in Poland, there is an additional recruitment for the territorial defense forces.
In other words, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
It is noticeable to citizens that the state is preparing for such events.
Among this is the recently passed new law on homeland defense, where the budget has been significantly increased for Poland's military needs.
The requirements for military recruitment have been changed, many points, which are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.
Your predictions have become reality in Syria, you warned about Russia's attack.
What do you make of the situation analysis: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
Regarding a nuclear strike, I don't really believe it.
But such a scenario exists.
Such a nuclear strike should be more demonstrative for NATO countries, and for Poland as well.
According to various estimates, it could have taken place in the Volyn region.
I should note, I wouldn't want this, but it's the worst-case scenario.
A small-scale strike, but one that all television channels would show this "mushroom".
To be seen from Poland, the Baltic countries.
In this case, the Russians expect a retreat and loss of combat readiness of NATO forces.
Positive scenarios are associated with the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian military, problems surrounding Putin, oligarchs who are currently suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.
We have facts of a power plant fire on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are starting to be outraged by prices.
Such regional issues will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my forecasts, I wrote that Russia will break up into 19 small countries.
We also have tendencies towards peaceful resolution of the war.
Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are inclined to halt significant military aggression in Ukraine due to their need for Russian energy resources.
At most, this will be delayed until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
Czech Republic discusses possible cessation of gas supply.
This will be a very significant blow, as the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Since I'm an analyst, I foresaw this.
I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.
My homeland will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there are a huge number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the price increase.
Citizens won't feel this for the first few months, but undoubtedly the prices for all resources will start to rise.
Now they are looking for various ways to certain alternative sources.
In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very large port in Poland.
Regarding oil, we have a clear factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.
Now, the buyout of gas stations in Poland will take place, actually, by Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international issues.
If Europe were to refuse Russian energy carriers, it would mean the loss of a source of funding for Russia's military.
Even a schoolboy understands, without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the ability to exist and will go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish media
Volodymyr Zelensky gave an interview to Polish media.
What are the Polish media saying about this?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has significantly increased.
And this growth is assessed as unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelensky thanks for the help, talks about real things happening nearby, he is in a city that is in a zone of military action.
That is, the actions of the president are evaluated as very active by politicians, analysts, and representatives of the authorities.
They testify that the Ukrainian government is fully committed to receiving military and financial aid to support refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discusses these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian government.
There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.
You can't hear that here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, resilience, ability to fight the enemy has significantly increased.
He does not fade or fall.
This is the most important thing, meaning there are no image losses.
In fact, Ukraine's image is being maintained, and this is very important.
Good morning.
Sorry to bother you again with my problems.
I feel very uncomfortable and embarrassed to complain to you.
Yesterday we tried to achieve something, but the attempt was in vain.
The mother-in-law's friend who helped find this apartment also joined the conflict.
She said she was looking for her not for us, and if something doesn't suit us, we should be the ones to leave and she will make sure that it's the mother-in-law, not us, who stays to live here.
Unfortunately, none of them think about the child who is used to this place, considers it their home, and has already changed 6 homes in 3 months.
I'm very sorry, I couldn't have guessed that such a situation would occur.
I apologize again for causing you trouble.
And as for the bed, the situation looks strange.
My husband and I discussed this issue before I wrote to you that the bed is not needed.
He was coming here to me and the child and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law decided for herself that he would sleep with her in the room and she didn't care about his opinion and wishes.
I am very embarrassed in front of you, your husband, Sharka and Jan, the apartment owner.
You tried so hard for us.
Understood.
I thought that it continues for some extended period.
What do you think, considering our situation and Andriy's treatment, would it be possible to do this at least by the end of summer?
Perhaps Andriy needs a medical certificate stating that he is ill.
In Ukraine, such a diagnosis would result in disability status..
And so, since Inna is not yet going to kindergarten, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the home.
Understood, then it would be good to go together with you tomorrow.
I will make a barcode for myself and Andriy.
I'm worried that they will stop providing humanitarian aid for him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take quite some time.
Can you give any advice?
I also wanted to ask, did you receive the money for the medicine you bought for Andriy?
The handle attachment is falling out.
It's short, so you need to be very careful and not lose it.
Today, only 2 portions were sold.
The apricot has run out.

He is freezing again, creaking.
Hadnes at 4.0.
As soon as people actively take it, he doesn't let go of the ice cream at all.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
Just as the line starts for ice cream, he starts giving out such nuances and people move on.
It's freezing.
If there is not enough ice cream, the piston will squeak and rub.
And you can't pour vanilla into mango.
Can Magdalena come at 8:00 tomorrow?
The ice cream needs to be washed.
Today the ice cream ran out, and tomorrow there will be a different flavor.

Mykola Mikhnovsky first read the text of independent Ukraine in 1990.
He was an ordinary man who fought for the independence of Ukraine.
Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine.
I believe there was a dictatorship because people had just left Russia and could not yet fully understand whether they liked being an independent country or they wanted to be an autonomous republic of Russia.
When Ukraine was independent, Kyiv already existed, but in the Soviet Union, the city of Kharkiv existed from 1912 to 1934.
I can't say there were any other interesting events, but if initially there was democracy, it was much better and probably now we would be in the European Union.
