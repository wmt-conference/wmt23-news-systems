FUJI System Development to Prevent Abandoned Accidents | Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic Information for Aichi, Gifu, Mie and Shizuoka
FUJI (headquartered in Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells robots and machine tools for mounting electronic components, has started to develop a system to prevent children from being left behind in cars.
A motion sensor is installed inside the vehicle, and when a person's movement is detected, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, the company is conducting a demonstration experiment using a pick-up vehicle at its own facility.
Protect children's safety in the midst of painful accidents caused by being left behind.
Currently, the company is conducting a demonstration experiment using two pick-up vehicles from the company's "teracoya THANK" English conversation after-school for children in Chiryu City.
Motion sensors that detect the movement of people based on the temperature difference between the person and the surroundings are installed in three places on the ceiling of the car.
When a vehicle detects a person's movement after a certain period of time with the vehicle's engine turned off and the door closed, a warning notification is automatically sent.
By linking information with the status of the engine and doors, false positives can be prevented as much as possible.
Warning notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to making a call to a pre-registered number, it will be displayed in the chat on a computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, so that mistakes such as missed ones do not occur.
The demonstration experiment is scheduled to continue until the end of February.
Kazumitsu Kamiya, manager of the second section of the Innovation Promotion Department, said, "During the experiment, we were able to see peripheral issues other than the system."
For example, they were able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"If we can expand our solutions," he says.
The development of this system was triggered by a series of accidents involving shuttle buses being left behind throughout Japan.
Employees with young children suggested what they could do to protect the safety of their children.
The company decided to develop the product in order to make use of its expertise in information management using IoT (Internet of Things) and sensors, which it had cultivated through its factory automation (FA) related business.
FUJI's anti-departure system is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to a pick-up vehicle, the company aims to lower the hurdle for introduction and popularize the system.
In the future, we will consider commercialization with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens.
[Editorial] The construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen line between Tsuruga and Shin-Osaka, which was scheduled to start in FY2023, has been postponed, and the town development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture has begun to be affected.
In Obama City, where the new station will be built, the detailed location of the station is not indicated even now, and urban planning including surrounding development is at a standstill.
It is expected to take a long time to formulate the plan, and it is necessary to make it public as soon as possible.
The planned Hokuriku Shinkansen station in Obama City will be the only new station to be built west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction and Transport Facilities Development Organization indicated that the approximate location of the station would be within a 2.5-kilometer radius of JR Higashi-Kohama Station.
The detailed location of the station and the route were to be determined by the winter of 2022.
In fiscal 2021, Obama City will begin full-scale operations related to the Shinkansen in anticipation of the opening of Tsuruga and the subsequent opening of Obama.
In the initial budget for fiscal 2022, the city plans to increase the number of projects and promote urban development in anticipation of the announcement of the location of the new station.
However, the detailed location of the new station has not yet been indicated.
The city has allocated 3 million yen to the budget for this fiscal year as a project to formulate a basic plan by considering land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station, but it is expected that it will not be executed.
City planning centered on the new station 'takes time to build consensus among citizens' (according to a city official).
There is an example in Echizen City of a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to compile an overall plan.
There is concern that the later the announcement is made, the shorter the preparation period until the opening of the facility, and the impact on the development of surrounding areas will be felt.
Before the location of the new station, there is a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, a citizens' group in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calling for the withdrawal of the extension plan.
In response to the postponement of construction work in Ishikawa Prefecture, there have been calls for reconsideration of the Maibara route, and there have been a series of moves to return the route setting that has been settled to the beginning, making it difficult to say that neighboring prefectures are monolithic.
Obama citizens are relatively calm about the postponement of construction, but if the location of the new station remains unclear and the timing of its opening remains unclear, there is concern that future momentum will be affected.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue making requests to the national government for the early opening of the entire line, but the voices of the areas along the line calling for construction to begin as soon as possible will be essential.
The national government and neighboring prefectures and municipalities cannot be moved by the indifference that "the Shinkansen (bullet train) will pass (west of Tsuruga) someday".
I want enthusiasm to keep raising my voice.

When Tokiharu's retainers heard the news that the Rokuhara Tandai had been destroyed, they immediately ran away and only about 20 people remained.
The monk soldiers of Heisen-ji Temple took advantage of this opportunity to attack the temple.
Tokiharu sent his wife and two children into the river and followed them to commit suicide.

A cat-shaped serving robot introduced at "Iwashio Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store".
(Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture)
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, there is a growing movement to introduce serving robots that carry food to the audience seats.
In addition to being useful for labor-saving store operations and "contactless" customer service to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the robot "s adorable facial expressions have been well received by family customers.
Restaurant owners and related parties have voiced the opinion that "it is difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, and serving robots will become more popular."
"Jin, Jin, Genghis Khan ♪"
While playing light music, a robot with a cat's face displayed on the screen smoothly runs through the store with food on it.
When you arrive at the table in the audience seat, you talk to the customer, "I brought the dish you ordered."
The Iwashio Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped serving robot in August 2022.
When a customer places an order on a robot waiting near the kitchen and presses the table number on the screen, it will autonomously drive to the table and deliver it.
It has built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice functions, reacts when a customer touches it, and the cat's face on the screen is rich in expression.
The Bonta Group, which operates the restaurant, has introduced serving robots at two of its stores, including the restaurant.
President Toshiyuki Saito stated that the biggest reason for introducing the system was the labor shortage, and emphasized that it was part of efforts to improve productivity through labor-saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of personnel expenses to store sales is usually around 30 percent, but with the introduction of the system, it has been reduced to 21 to 22 percent.
The robot also plays a role in collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, which leads to more efficient cleaning up afterwards. "Families and children are happy, and it also has an advertising effect," he adds.
Rokken Hoshiyama Fukui, a yakiniku (grilled meat) and hormone hot pot restaurant in Araki Shinbo-cho, Fukui City, also introduced a serving robot in August 2022.
Eifuku Hoshiyama, president of Seongsan Shoten Co., Ltd., said, "Even if we recruit employees and part-time workers, they don't come easily, so I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
The Fukui store operates by separating the zone where employees serve meals and the robot delivery range.
The lease fee for the robot is said to be about the same as the wage for one part-time worker.
In order to save labor, the store has introduced an ordering system using tablet devices in addition to robots, and is considering self-checkout.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the effective job openings-to-applicants ratio by job type in December 2022 was 6.94 times for "customer service" such as restaurants, which is a job type with a high sense of labor shortage.
A person in charge of Net System Co., Ltd. (Takagi-Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which is responsible for the sales agency of serving robots, says, "The labor shortage at restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and there are many inquiries about introducing robots."
Mr. Hoshiyama said, "It will be even more difficult to secure employees at suburban stores in rural areas in the future, and I think that serving robots will become more popular."
[Editorial] Echizen Town made an ending note and distributed it to the townspeople who wanted it.
Two years ago, he published the Okuyami Handbook, which covered the procedures required when a relative died, a written inheritance list, and a family tree, and many people came to pick it up for themselves.
In various parts of the prefecture, lectures on how to write ending notes and organize life are often held, and it seems that "end-of-life" is firmly established among the people of the prefecture.
The ending note of Echizen-cho is page 35.
Starting with a review of one's own history in five chapters, it describes the current state of health and assets, future nursing care, hopes for end-of-life medical care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section where you can write what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message for your loved ones.
It's hard to write that there are 35 pages, but you don't have to fill all the pages.
What do you want to write to your family and the people around you the most?
what's important is to clarify the purpose.
At bookstores and other places, a variety of notebooks are sold according to the purpose, and it is said that it is easy to start writing from where you can write.
It is said that the word "shikatsu" was born in 2009, comparing it to job hunting.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly", and more people are preparing for their own end or end of life.
It has been more than 10 years since then.
The COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the world has not yet subsided.
Russia "s invasion of Ukraine and other factors have pushed prices higher, and electricity prices this winter have jumped to an unexpected level.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current high prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, funeral expenses, nursing care expenses, grave management, etc. were shared by siblings and relatives, but now it is not uncommon for only children.
In addition, although life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a long time ago, the risk of dementia and the need for nursing care increases as we get older.
I would like to keep in mind that the background to the fact that the end of life did not end in a transient manner and took root was also the rise of social unrest.
In any case, we all wish we didn "t want to overburden our partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword in the ending note, but don't be too self-righteous.
Instead of secretly writing wishes and requests, I would like to consult with my family at least once and prepare for that time gently.
Prime Minister Fumio KISHIDA (second from the right) and Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Keiko NAGAOKA (third from the right) take a commemorative photo with the people concerned at the elementary school they visited.
At the graduation ceremony, students, teachers and staff members said they did not need to wear masks in principle. (February 10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture)
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided that students should not wear masks at graduation ceremonies.
"It's actually difficult to keep a wide distance between students, so I'm worried about how to deal with it, and some students are worried about taking off their masks," said the head of a junior high school at a large school.
This topic has been raised among teachers in response to news reports about the wearing of masks at graduation ceremonies.
On the other hand, a principal of an elementary school said, "If the government decides not to wear it, it will be possible to deal with it realistically if it does not include choirs."
At this graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to relax the measures, such as allowing current students who had refrained from participating and resuming the chorus of graduates.
In the prefecture, prefectural high schools are scheduled to hold ceremonies in early March, and public elementary and junior high schools are scheduled to hold ceremonies in the middle of the same month.
The prefectural and municipal boards of education will wait for an official notice from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology to make a decision on how to respond.
There were also cautious comments about the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) "s decision not to require the wearing of masks in all school education activities from the new semester this spring.
The head of the elementary school said, "Children will be confused if they suddenly do not have a mask one day, and it is natural that the number of children who decide to 'wear it freely' and then gradually remove it will increase."
× × × ×
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided not to require the wearing of masks in school education activities from April in accordance with the government's new guidelines for wearing masks.
As a general rule, masks will not be used in choirs, physical education classes, and club activities.
During the 2022 academic year, we will request infection control measures in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and we will inform the Board of Education and school sites of precautions after April.
Graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high, and high schools, universities, and other institutions will continue to take measures such as ventilation during the 2022 academic year, and graduates, faculty and staff members, and current students participating in the ceremonies will basically not wear masks.

For 18 years and 10 months, we have been patrolling the rocky shores of Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a famous suicide spot, to prevent suicide, and we continue to support suicide attempts until they are discovered, protected, and restarted.
This book summarizes the problems we have heard from the 784 people we have protected so far (as of February 6), and appeals to the Prime Minister about the government's measures necessary to prevent suicide by the following seven items.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) "Human rights violations" are piled up behind the suicide.
(3) Suicides are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat people living outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) Even if a person with mental disorders such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, it is treated as an "accident".
(6) The "duty of care for safety" in high-risk areas of suicide has been forgotten and commercialism is running.
(7) The part of the doctrine of an emerging religious group that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of threatening the other party to provide money or goods by telling the curse of the future is blackmail.
Religious organizations that are committing these crimes of fraud and extortion should be made public and excluded.
Therefore, we have received comments from those who have subscribed to this book, such as "I was impressed by the strong mental strength of the people who are working on this activity", "This former police officer is a mirror among police officers", "It is a living Bodhisattva who supports like his own family even though he is such a stranger", etc.
When I saw a picture of a newspaper article, I cried, "What are you thinking?"
I have heard that the number of suicides among people who have been cornered by the coronavirus is increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone is like that person.
I would like to see a society where people can live happily with the lives they receive.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude to all the staff who are doing their best to those who have suffered so much pain that they want to die.
I think that this activity is an activity that is physically and mentally overworked, but I would like to ask you to continue to talk to me.
Thank you very much.
kashiko.
I hope that you, as readers, will also become the gatekeepers of life in your community.

Kenji Shimada, who takes photos of capybaras almost every week and posts them on social media, announced on February 1 that the indoor facility "Happijan" at Asuwayama Park Amusement Park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, is located in Fukui Prefecture.
There is a man in Fukui City who takes pictures of capybaras at the indoor facility "Happijan" in Asuwayama Park Amusement Park in Fukui Prefecture every week and posts them on Instagram.
The posts are lined with a variety of thumbnail images, such as the moment when he yawns with his teeth peeking out from his big mouth, and the figure lying down and basking in the sun.
He has more than 10,000 followers both in Japan and abroad, helping to spread the appeal of Hapijan and Capybara to many people.
Shizuka Kudo posts traditional vegetables from Fukui Prefecture on Instagram
The man is Kenji SHIMADA (38), a company employee living in the city.
In March 2021, it began posting information on social networking sites (SNS).
Capybara is one of the world's largest rats, and is good at swimming with a scratch between their fingers.
Since its opening in 2018, Hapijan has raised a total of three animals, one male and two female, and you can observe them up close and feed them.
Shimada-san first learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
When he saw the video of him relaxing in a hot spring, he was shocked and asked, "What is this animal?"
I was drawn to the charming expressions and gestures as if they were human beings.
After that, I heard that it will be bred in Hapijan, and I was looking forward to seeing it nearby.
I started taking photos in earnest about three years ago when I bought a single-lens reflex camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of the capybaras, and you will not miss the shutter opportunity such as the appearance of shaking the body and cutting the water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram is about 830, and I look back and say, "I took this much."
Perhaps he learned Shimada-san while he was going to school, the male Yamato-kun came up to him and cried "Kyurukyuru".
"It's cute and I'm so happy," says Shimada, and his love for capybaras continues to deepen.
Through SNS, he enjoys interacting with capybara lovers from all over the country, such as showing off his best shots every month.
Shimada, who goes to zoos in neighboring prefectures to see capybaras, said with a smile, "I would like to continue shooting and sending out photos mainly of Asuwayama, the home of capybaras."
Instagram is searched by "Kapipon".
Toba City Calls for Return of Double Payment of Child-Rearing Household Benefits - The Ise Shimbun
[Toba] Toba City announced on October 10 that a total of 600,000 yen was mispaid to 12 people in 11 households regarding the special benefits for families raising children (for other households) in FY2021.
The city will apologize to the victims, explain the circumstances, and request procedures for their return.
According to the city, it was discovered on January 27, 1993, when a parent of the target child who confirmed the past payment pointed out.
A survey of 182 people from 79 households in the same fiscal year revealed that the benefits paid on July 20, 2021 were double paid to 12 people from 11 households.
The city will provide 50,000 yen per person as a benefit to high school students and younger in households exempt from resident tax.
The company had received data from a computer company to which it had contracted, but the staff in charge mistook that high school students were not included and added them to the data, which resulted in double payments.
A person in charge of the city's child-rearing support office said, "We take this matter very seriously, and we will take all possible measures to prevent recurrence, such as re-checking the data, to restore trust."

It is also snow.
It is not a cold wave from the north, but it seems to be the influence of the south coast low pressure moving eastward in the Japanese archipelago.
It's been a short time since we experienced the unusual cold of 24-26th of last month, and even the same cold that we can't let our guard down will be even more bearable for the people of the earthquake-stricken Republic of Turkey.
The building collapsed in an instant.
Together with neighboring Syria, more than 20,000 people have been killed so far, and many people are still left behind in the rubble.
It started in 1890 when the Ottoman Empire dispatched the warship Erturl to Japan.
The fact that residents of Kushimoto Town in Wakayama Prefecture helped and cared for the crew is introduced in movies and novels. About 100 years after this accident, Turkish aircraft were dispatched to rescue Japanese hostages by Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War, and they were rewarded for their kindness.
Those who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.
I would like to pay attention to the situation until it calms down and reconstruction and recovery.

Belino Hotel Subsidy Fraudulent Recipients Prefecture and City Accommodation Support Project Already Fully Refunded | Iwate Nichinichi Online
The prefectural government and Ichinoseki City announced on October 10 that Bellino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yamame, Ichinoseki City) had been using the hotel inappropriately for about a year since October 2021, as part of their respective subsidy programs to discount travelers' accommodation fees.
When people who were not eligible for the discount stayed at the hotel, the discount was applied by lending the name by the employee.
There were also many cases of employees using accommodations that were not in line with the business purpose of "stimulating tourism demand."
The total amount of 7,231,000 yen received due to improper use, including voluntary surveys by the prefecture, the city, and the hotel, has been returned by June 6.
The prefecture's "Iwate Travel Support Project" and the city's "Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount", which were implemented in response to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, were illegally receiving subsidies.
The period was from October 18, 2021 to October 10, 2022 (the Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount was September 30, 2022), and as a result of the survey, there were 95 cases of inappropriate use that was not eligible for the discount, such as outside the target area or unvaccinated, amounting to 587,000 yen, and 1,239 cases of use that was not in line with the purpose or purpose of the project, amounting to 6.644 million yen.
When the prefectural contractor was proceeding with the settlement procedure, it was confirmed that the user of the accommodation discount and the person in charge of reception at the hotel were the same person.
The prefecture's detailed investigation revealed inappropriate use, and the city, which received this information, confirmed the facts.
The city's project has already been completed, and the registration for the prefectural project was deleted on December 2 last year.
In response to the interview, Michiaki Dobashi, CEO of Berino, which operates the hotel, said, "We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to the local people, the prefecture and the city, and many people.We are very sorry.We are a hotel with the local people, and we would like to start again from scratch and work to restore trust."
Takahito Chiba, head of the promotion section of the prefecture's tourism and promotion office, said, "It is truly regrettable, and we would like to once again encourage compliance with the rules and establish compliance, and call for proper use in accordance with the purpose of the project."
Mayor Yoshihito Sato said, "It is truly regrettable that there was an inappropriate use of the project at an accommodation facility in the city."

Introduction of the pioneers of plant research Hayachine-san collection materials also City Cultural Heritage Center Special Exhibition [Hanamaki] | Iwate Nichinichi Online
Hayachine is known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, and a special exhibition titled "The People Who Introduced the Flowers of Hayachine: A Brief History of Hayachine Botanical Research" is being held at the City Cultural Heritage Center in Osako-cho, Hanamaki City, until the 12th.
It collects 124 valuable specimens and other materials collected by its predecessors, and introduces the footprints of its predecessors who were involved in plant research on Mt.
The study of plants on Mt. Hayachine began with Karl Johann Maximovich (1827-91), a Russian plant researcher who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Chonosuke SUKAWA (1842-1925), who was from Shiwa-cho and collected plants under Maximovich 's guidance.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to walk freely in the country because of foreigners, asked Sugawa to collect it and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa continued to support his research after returning to Maximovich, which led to the presentation of "Himekozakura," "Nambutouchiso," and "Miyamayamabukishoma," which are unique to Mt.
After that, Tomitaro MAKINO (1862 - 1957), a modern plant taxonomist, published 'Nambutranoo,' 'Kobanotsumekusa,' and 'Nambuinunazuna' in 1903 based on the collection of local researchers, and 'Katohakobe,' which he discovered and named after climbing Mt. Hayachine in 2005.
From the exhibition materials, we can see that many researchers have revealed valuable alpine plants.
He also introduced Matsunosuke SUGIMURA (1874-1948), who was the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School and studied plants, and Shichiro TAMAKAWA (1914-1988), who served as a curator at the Osako Municipal Mountain Museum and was involved in the publication of 'Hayachine no Botanicals' (Plants of Hayachine), who accompanied the research on the preservation of natural monuments in 1927.
Sohei Yoshida, a curator at the center, says, "Behind each plant's name is the accumulation of research and the connection between people, which allows us to trace the connections between researchers from rural areas to the whole country."
The special exhibition consists of four chapters, with the first chapter focusing on the faith and history of Hayachine, and the second chapter focusing on the characteristics of Mt. Hayachine from the geological point of view based on the research conducted by Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundation of Japanese geology.

Amami Airport's Second Decarbonization Promotion Council Discusses Renewable Energy Introduction and Targets | The Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
A meeting to promote decarbonization of Amami Airport was held in Kasari Town, Amami City, on September 9.
The "Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council" (Chairman: Takashi ANDO, Director of the Construction Division of the Oshima Branch Office of the Prefectural Government, 13 members), which consists of the prefecture and airlines using the airport, held its second meeting at the airport on September 9 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at Amami Airport (Kasari-cho, Amami City).
All committee members attended the meeting, including online.
They exchanged views on setting targets for decarbonization and introducing renewable energy, mainly solar power generation.
Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) has set an overall target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at each airport by 46 percent or more by 2030 (compared to fiscal 2013 levels) in order to achieve carbon neutrality, which aims to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In response to this, the council held its first meeting in November last year, aiming to formulate a plan ahead of the other six remote islands in the prefecture.
As with the first meeting, the second meeting was closed to the public except at the beginning.
According to Mr. Ando, who responded to the interview after the meeting, the meeting confirmed the amount of greenhouse gas emissions at the airport.
It is said that discussions were carried out in line with the guidelines of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism to set targets and introduce renewable energy.
According to the handout, CO2 emissions from the airport's facilities and vehicles in fiscal 2013, which is the base year, were 1,476 tons (excluding aircraft).
Of these, lighting and air conditioning emissions from seven facilities, including the airport terminal building, accounted for about 90 percent at 1,321 tons, followed by 84 tons of air lighting and 71 tons of airport vehicles.
The council will proceed with discussions on targets for reducing emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Mr. Ando said, "We are at a passing point now, and the members are in the same direction, so we would like to compile the interim report thoroughly first."
After hearing opinions on the draft interim report at the third meeting and the draft final report at the fourth meeting, a promotion plan will be formulated.
"Sakasa Real Estate" Okinoerabu branch office opened to attract people to the island | Society and Economy | Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
Opening event to deepen understanding of "Sakasa Real Estate" through talk sessions, etc. (May 8, Renmei-machi)
[Okinoerabu General Bureau] The Okinoerabu branch office opening event of the real estate web service "Sakasa Real Estate", which visualizes the thoughts of people who want to challenge by renting vacant houses and stores, and recruits landlords, was held on the 8th at the well-known community space "entaku".
Through a talk session, the operating company explained the outline of the service.
Masahiro OKUBO, the representative director of Tsuginova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), who is in charge of managing the branch office, said, "By carrying out this initiative on Oki-no-erabu Island, we hope to create a movement and flow to attract people to the entire island."
In contrast to normal real estate procedures, Sakasa Real Estate discloses the information of the person who wants to rent it, contacts the lender, and if an agreement is reached, the contract is made by each person.
It is operated by On-Co Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture) as a demonstration experiment to discover potential vacant houses and build relationships through vacant houses, and the service was launched in June 2020.
This is the seventh branch office established and the first in Kyushu.
It is the first remote island in Japan.
The event was attended by about 20 people, including On-Co and Tsuginova staff, Wadomari and Renmei town hall staff, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background to the establishment of the branch office, saying, "With the movement to attract people from outside the island becoming more active, I thought that if we could make use of vacant houses and stores, the town and the island would become more exciting."
"We would like to connect with people who have properties on the island or who want to do something, and help them advance their efforts as many times as possible," he said.
Takefumi Mizutani, On-Co's representative, said, "It is necessary to take care of each vacant house and discuss what the local people want to do with this area, what kind of people they want to attract, and what criteria to choose."
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information will be gathered," he said, calling on the islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

that's what i'm feeling.

It's a common story with Chinese-made fake stainless steel.

training.

If you train when you're energy-depleted, you'll lose muscle.

Please tell us about the economic benefits of reducing working hours.
According to reports from companies that have reduced their working hours, employees have improved their own work efficiency by reducing their working hours, which in turn has improved the company "s business performance.
With improved business performance, salaries will increase and holidays will increase, so the amount of consumption will also increase, which will also have an economic effect.
cars, studless tires, high air pressure, doesn't that have anything to do with driving on snowy roads?
if you increase the air pressure, will you increase the fuel consumption a little?
i think we need to make it quite high.
i think it's going to improve rolling resistance.
Since studless tires are low-pressure tires, high-pressure tires do not bite the snow or make it easy to burst.

After applying mascara and drying it, divide it into three stages and gradually curve it.
If you put the mascara on first, it will be nori to put it simply, and it will feel solid (solid), so if you curl it as it is, it will be easy to fix.

About Instagram.
I have about 10,000 followers now, but would you think it would be amazing if people who don't know this saw it?
or don't you think anything about it?
what's it like?
I think it's amazing.
It is a miracle for ordinary people.
I think he was doing something special.
there's a problem. there's a setback.
Since I can not take time to exercise easily, I bought it to rely on the popular pressurized innerwear.
The body shape is H175m W 80kg I bought a L size.
It is quite difficult to wear at first, but I think it will be fine once you get used to it.
I've been using it for a few days, but now I'm using another pressurized inner because of a problem.
The problem is 1. If the arm circumference is not quite slender, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve (just the second arm) is too tight, and it becomes a little congested, itchy.
2, the lower abdomen is loose I stopped using it because of the above two problems.
It is quite tight in terms of comfort, but it is no problem to sleep while wearing it.
it's a good deal for someone who fits.
Even 158 cm and 50 kg were S okay.
But it didn't suit me, who has a big skeleton and is muscular.
Since it is not a three-dimensional construction such as the buttocks, strange gaps are created and it is easy to fall down and does not fit.
I always felt like I had to pull it up.
I think it's good if you have a body shape like a stick.
Is it a safe thinness in terms of thickness?
It's not like I'm going to break it, but I was able to boot in with the perfect knee-high boots and feel refreshed.

I don't know what it feels like if it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is solid, and I thought that it was a bargain that it was this price.
There was no wire on the bust part, but when I touched it, it seems that there is a hard core at the bottom of the putt.
But it doesn't hurt even if you wear it, and it follows your bust properly, so I think it looks good when you move.
Did you change the model from no pat to there?

I'm looking forward to going into the water ♪ Thank you very much!
45 kg 156 cmM size and a little larger.
Because the raincoat is a thick fabric, it feels hot and humid, but I think that it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is solid.
Two rain visors were attached to prevent my face from getting wet.
There was no problem with the strength, and I could use it with confidence even on a bicycle in a storm.
It didn't even tear after use.
I carry it in a compact state in a compression bag.
Really, it was a product that exceeded my expectations at this price.
I was able to install it safely.
The CLA180 Shooting Brake was fitted to the 2016 model.
Even an amateur can wear it if you read the YOU tube and instructions.
Please note that if you loosen the torque screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
i dropped one and went missing.
After that, if you insert the gray connector into the brown and red-green wiring and do it with a tapered type such as radio pliers, the force will not be evenly applied and the plastic will break as shown in the photo and you will not be able to attach it.
When I call support, they mail me a new cable the next day, and it is a company with very solid support.
When I tried again, I put a lot of effort into it with a wide pliers as shown in the picture in the instruction manual, and it worked.
When returning the last main unit to the car, it takes a little trick to store the wiring, but I managed to install it.
After installation, DVD, TV, and navigation can be viewed while driving without any problems.
I think it is a very cost-effective product because it costs more than 80,000 yen if you order it at a dealer, and more than 40,000 yen even at a specialty store.
it's below price.
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated. First of all, the cotton inside is poly, but it's cut in the cushion, and there are fluffy parts and skunky parts. It looks like it's already worn out, or rather, it's less cotton overall, and I've tried it out, but I think that if you don't use it for a trial, it may or may not fit. I thought that separate pillows and cuddles would not fail.
it's neither possible nor impossible.
The goods have arrived.
I used it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use and it can be milked properly.
However, there are times when the sound is a little annoying and the response of the power button is bad.
I don't care because I can use it without any problems, but people who are interested may be concerned.
It's not super quiet.If you use it in the middle of the night, you may be a little careful.
Also, I was worried that the part that connects the attached tube and the machine would get into the tube, but I entered it in the form of pushing it in.
You need a trick to whip it up.
I'm not sure if it's the worst compatibility with my hair quality or if it's a problem with the performance of this shampoo, but it doesn't lather at all with normal use.
(The shampoo I have been using so far lathers without any problems even if I use it normally) Here is the solution I found ↓ 1 First, pick up less shampoo than usual and blend it into the whole hair.
(At this point, it does not lather at a level where no foam appears.) 2 Wash your hair once, then take a suitable amount of shampoo in your hand and blend it into your hair.
Well, in short, it's a double wash lol Since the volume of the shampoo itself is quite small, the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo for the first time as much as possible... I am satisfied with the effect of shampoo itself.
It's obvious that I bought this expensive shampoo, but I clearly felt that my hair felt better.
However, my honest impression is that I was not satisfied with the overall review.
It's a pity that the Quattro Botanico series was taken care of by the face wash goods...
Even though the capacity is small, it is not cost-effective to be forced to wash twice.
In addition, considering the scent that does not seem to be popular with everyone, I will make it a little strict here with two stars.
it's hard to assess.
There are negative positives, and it is difficult to evaluate.
The front side of the blade will be clean with the cleaner of the blade.
I think that matching with a razor with good accuracy of the original blade is good.
Posi: As intended, it removes sebum, soap residue, and other dirt on the blade.
(Only on the front side) If it is dirty and the sharpness is bad, it will last longer.
Negative: The life of the smoother is extremely reduced.
Titanium coating, ceramic coating, etc. that are coated on the cutting edge will easily peel off the coating.
(If you shave a few times, the coating will almost come off, so I think you should use this cleaner after that.)
Be careful with razors that say "Do not wipe the cutting edge".
I heard that it can be substituted with fall prevention rubber (vibration-proof rubber) that is put under furniture etc. used as a preparation for earthquakes, so I feel like it is cost-effective.
It is a place where the life of the razor that I use is increased by 20-30%.
It is difficult to judge when the razor blade is thrown away, but I think it is when the blade is damaged by shaving and the cutting edge becomes rattled.
In that sense, I think it is a good product because it can prevent sharpness down by dirt.
(It's a cleaner and doesn't have the effect of sharpening, sometimes it feels like it's being sharpened, but it seems that it feels like it's removing a little rust.)
i was caught in a tv commercial.
I bought it because I saw the face of a pretty old woman pull up just by applying it once in a TV commercial.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little firmer than a normal gel, and I wipe it off with pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it feels sticky and disgusting, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will unexpectedly enter your skin.
After entering, there was almost no stickiness, and the skin felt like it was sticking to my hands.
The lift-up didn't go as well as TV.
I felt a sense of firmness at once.
I have super dry skin, so this one is not enough, so I have been using a certain Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It's just a feeling of moisture.
I was expecting it to cover the loosening of the pores, but it does not cover.
I think it will be effective if you use one bottle, and if there is, there will be a repeat.
i'm sure it was a lot of work to put together, but...
It is a labor work that looks back on the statements of politicians over the past few years.
As I read it, I am somehow convinced that what he said at that time was in the end.
However, when considering its value as a reading material, it is a delicate matter whether the "fact check" that the authors call is sufficient.
To be honest, it is not interesting to read.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the major drawback of this book was in the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "facts" here is forever true or not.
I felt that it was quite suspicious from the way they wrote, whether they were aware of the fragility of "fact check" (or the possibility of disproving it).
I feel a little gloomy when Japanese journalists' perception of "facts" reaches this level.
It seems that there are many people who recommend it, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge about the contents of this book.
If there are readers like reviewers who are interested in the "fact-checking" conducted by the current Japanese media, I think this book is not suitable.
For those who do not improve their score in the mock exam.
At my school, politics and economics are printed, and the class format is like studying while being forced to do it, so it was really boring, and before I knew it, I hated politics and economics.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
Currently in high school 3 this year Center.
I bought it in March and chose it as my study partner for an hour on my way to and from school.
First impressions are easy to understand.
you've reached god's realm.
When I finished one lap and took the past questions, I was 70 with an average of 40 at that time.
I was surprised by the flow of stones.
you'll grow as if you've eaten something strange.
What I could get from this reference book was not only knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also my ability and motivation to study.
thank you for letting me meet you.
Crime prevention
Eight years ago, I experienced two attempts to pick the entrance, and I have been taking crime prevention measures.
This time it is a replacement from the camera purchased 8 years ago.
In the past, we used the infrared irradiation 30m type (another company).
This product was written by another person, but the distance that can recognize the face at night is about 5 meters.
I agree with him.
I have just arrived and have not set it up, but it is at the stage of comparing the appearance of the camera and checking the defect.
The image quality is much better than the camera of 8 years ago (naturally).
I divided the display into 4 parts on a 32-inch monitor, but there is no problem if the shooting size is maximized.
At the moment, there are no problems with the product.
If you are considering a level that can recognize your face other than crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied with night shooting, but at this price it is the best!
I'm for crime prevention, but I don't require facial recognition.
Because if you wear a mask or mask, you won't know (especially at night).
Professional burglars (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
Even if it is small, it seems to distinguish between a high-performance camera and a recording.
On the other hand, if you are not a professional, you will be in trouble.
However, recent burglars are bold and clever, so I recommend using them with various security goods instead of relying only on cameras.
For example, a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained at a home center for about 1,500 yen (the latest one is very bright, with 6 units).
Since it is solar, there is no need to pay for electricity, but since it does not light up until morning in winter, it also has three 100V motion LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30 meters that can recognize human figures.
In addition, if you think that the intimidation effect will fade due to the small size of the camera during daytime crime prevention, I think that you need a cover with ingenuity.
I have a sticker that says "24 hours security camera working".
It is an original product of the security camera manufacturer that I used before.
It is more effective for manufacturer's products than sticking what is sold at home centers.
The place to put it is a thief's intrusion route that can not be covered by camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
At the same time, it is difficult to understand the instruction of the net setting, so it is negative.
If there are any deficiencies after setting up and setting, we will add them.
the more painful it is to read, the more empathic it is.
If she was born in 1982 in Japan, her social situation may be a little better than her, but even with the enforcement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law, the situation is still far from equal.
As I continued reading, the painful memories of living through discrimination as a member of society came back to me, and I felt suffocating.
Not only in Korea and Japan, but also in feudal society, it depicts the suffering of all women who try to live as human beings, not as women.
At the very least, it is time for women alone to stop the emotional conflict and stand shoulder to shoulder in this society.
it's a drama that makes you think men are the worst
The story of the main character who was sexually abused by his biological father as a child.
Of course, even if you become an adult, you will continue to drag the wound.
All the men who come out are the worst.
The husband of the main character, who seems to be gentle and family-friendly, is also the worst in a sense.
There is a spoiler ↓ Even if you know that the main character's sister is receiving domestic violence from her husband, you ignore it, and the sister-in-law finally has the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, but the main character's husband, who is a police officer, passes through, etc.
The old mother of the main character pretending to be bokeh knows the fact that her husband (the real father of the main character) was killed by her daughter, but the daughter does not know it (officially, the death of the real father is a drug overdose).
In short, after the death of the rape father, it seems that he did not let his daughter receive counseling, and it is natural that the main character goes crazy.
the daughter of the main character wants to hear about her grandfather who died so much?
do you care about the old man who died so young?
In the drama? too much.
A few years ago, when a heat wave hit France, many elderly people died in the summer, and when hospitals and facilities contacted their daughters and sons, many French people said that they could not take them because they were on vacation, and it was reported that the morgue in Paris was full.
These are "dry."
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that it was "dry".
The French ones are completely different from the American ones, and many of them have a good aftertaste with their hazy parts, but there were relatively many scenes where I thought it would be better to cut them.
the line between professionals.
If a precise calculation and an unexpected accident that could not be read were related to someone's life, even if he had calculated it from the beginning to some extent, he would have been prepared to bet himself.
The screenplay, which embodies such a subtle and moving drama of how she struggles with her own struggles that she does not show in public, and how far she deceives those around her in order to pass on her beliefs, was superb.
And yet... Jessica's performance is truly amazing.
no matter what you look at, there's no mistake.
it's a professional job.
it's working. it's broken.
I've used three of them so far, but this product broke down in no time, in a good or bad way.
The reason why I chose this product was that I used the first 2200 milliampere built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out in 200 degrees, 5 minutes and 3 sessions.
The USB terminal of the second unit is defective.
It will not be possible to charge.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but after about 15 times of battery replacement (I used the battery in the charger so that the USB terminal does not break), it became difficult to turn on the power, probably because the contact became bad.
Press the lid to turn on the power.
If you are an ICOS user, I think there are some who have experience.
it's that symptom.
As mentioned in the cautionary note, batteries other than those attached are not used.
The claws and catch parts are carved out, so there seems to be no curvature.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought without the Starry logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the comparison with this.
It looks the same in size.
The same applies to the chamber and the draw.
LCD This is more beautiful.
It may be newer than without a logo.
Vibrator This is a modest.
It looks like a vibe on a smartphone.
Without a logo, the vibration of the vibe or the sound is loud.
Cheesy Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese...
Attachments are a little different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
Without a logo, it looks like a lump of steel wool.
Roughly that's how it is.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it breaks quickly, it will lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose to return it, so I proceeded with the procedure although it was troublesome.
it's just ear rubber, but ear rubber.
This flat rubber really doesn't hurt.
It is the best mask of the same type I have used so far in terms of good ear contact.
Even with flat rubber, it may be twisted, and the twisted part of the helicopter rubs into the base of the ear, which may be more painful than round rubber, but this product is not only soft to the touch, but also the length is just made to be difficult to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, and not only does it fit, but it also creates a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower side of the chin = in front of the mouth, so it is hard to feel suffocating.
It may be because it fits the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it fits everyone in the same way, but I think it's a good idea to try it once if you think that all other small sizes are not good.
When you open the outer box, it is in a vinyl with a central slit like a box tissue, but when you take out the first one, the ear rubber on both sides gets stuck and it is difficult to take out, so I reduced it by one star.
the contractor's response is one star.
The price and taste were perfect, but I was distrusted by the response of the vendor who ignored it and sent it even though the date was specified.
In addition to this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
I always buy on Amazon, so I know the delivery person.
I tried to adjust the arrival date as much as possible because it carries especially heavy items to the top, but it was ruined.
It is said that the shipping company is difficult because of Amazon, but we are doing it with the hope that there is one thing we can cooperate with on the user side.
I'm disappointed with the arrogant trader's response.
But the price is cheap.
if you're looking to buy it, you're going to have to pay for it.
There are a lot of complaints and I think it can not be used for a long time.
I think that it is better to consider the cost when disposing.
As a reference, some local governments have centers that accept bulky garbage for free or cheap if you bring it in.
[Sitting comfort] The seat surface is slightly tilted to the left and it is even more rickety, so it is very tiring to sit.
If you move even a little, you will make a loud noise.
it's too noisy to use at night.
This is the biggest problem, and I feel that I can't continue to use it.
[Assembly] The assembly instruction manual is only a rough illustration.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many errors.
There is a review that says that it leans forward, but there is a possibility that the direction when installing the seat surface and the support base is opposite.
When installed correctly, the height adjustment lever is facing backward on the right hand side, and the dial that adjusts the direction of the spring on the back is in front.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural in the forward direction, many people will accidentally install it.
There are no such basic precautions in the instruction manual, and it is necessary to assemble while trying and error while looking at miscellaneous pictures.
The list of contents at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who do not find the 8x20mm screw that comes with 12 screws and look for it.
The 8x20mm screw is already inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to look for it unnecessarily.
The work accuracy is low, and there seems to be a combination that can be inserted even with the same screw hole and screw, and a combination that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, it is very difficult just to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with screws inserted like this.
Also, I couldn't find any spare screws in the instructions.
[Other] The black part of the surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring, and it is whitish in some places, so it is better not to expect beautiful things like product photos.
An explanation of the deficiencies in the instructions and a supplementary explanation of the above installation method were sent to the email address registered with amazon 2-3 days after the arrival of the product.
Originally, these items should be released immediately after the product is shipped.
Many buyers have completed the assembly within two to three days of the arrival of the product, so it is completely meaningless.
well, uh...
I am a big fan of Thermos and have been using the Thermos straw type for more than 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use...
1 The drinking part of the straw has become a harder material than before, and the groove has become a click on the body, and the drinking part of the straw can not be removed at all from the body!
i'm desperately trying to get it off, and my nails are cracked.
2 Only the tip of the mouth of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush can no longer fit.
3 The mysterious part called the valve attached to the tip of the straw is thicker than the straw brush, and it is dramatically difficult to wash.
I'm a bit shocked because I haven't had any complaints about using the straw type before.
It's really stressful to not be able to drink from the body.
The good point was the outstanding cooling power as usual.
I forgot to take it out of my bag When I wash it the next day, about 50% of the ice I put in the previous day is still left.
I don't drink hot, so I'll continue to be a straw type.
Thank you for your improvement in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
I will review it for the first time.
(It is the impression of an amateur who bought a doll from scratch for the first time and has little knowledge of wearing a doll eye for the first time) The product as shown in the photo arrived.
When it is attached to the obitsdor, it is very cute and light enters and is very satisfied.
However, it cannot be installed unless the entrance (entrance) is a little hard and pushed in.
I think the method is different, but I put tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping Since it was the first time to ship from overseas, I was using 3 weeks as a guide, but it arrived in 8 days (near Narita Airport) earlier than I expected.
However, I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
If you look at Amazon's shipping description earlier, it is still written as shipping.
There was no damage and no air in the eyes, and the back of the envelope had a lot of petits and was in a small sealed bag, so I think it was safe for the time being.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information okay even though it is an e-mail from overseas?
I felt doubt, so I will make it minus 1.
The product is at that price without any problems, and I think that this amount is a very good deal.
Addendum Doll Eye 8mm model iPhonese
it's a little small. it's very charged.
I ordered it after seeing the size notation, but I felt it was about two times smaller than I imagined.
Although it is larger than A4 size, the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I was planning to use it when repairing electronic devices and making Gundam, but it is difficult to use without B4 size.
If you use it only for soldering iron work, and use another tray or mat for other work such as assembly and disassembly, you may be able to manage.
It's impossible to place tools, place parts, and do more work within the area of a magazine.
I thought about ordering another one of the same ones to double the area, but I think it would be difficult to keep using it for a while because it is too charged during the work, and all the dust and cut parts will be sucked up.
it's a fatal flaw.
After struggling to open the lid of the battery box, I finally opened the lid using a rubber anti-slip sheet, but when I tried to load the battery and close it, it did not close.
At this point is out.
you're highly rated!
Will the battery box lid close???
In addition, instead of the product's protective seal, there was a little saran wrap on it.
Is this a second-hand item??
The only explanation is in English, which is written on a small piece of paper.
There is no explanation of the illustration and I do not know how to operate it.
Maybe it's another finger.
I found a good product!
I bought it right away.
I use it for pinky rings, so if I don't use it a lot, it won't fit perfectly and I'm a little bumpy...
But I think it's good for using it on other fingers.
But I think it's a good idea merchant.
it's the price.
After all, you should not seek quality in this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was crushed.
The size is just right when I put it on.
People with thick earlobes may be tough, though.
Maybe I should have bought a patternless one.
oh, my god.
The design is good, but if you put it on your hand, the effect will not fade even if you put it on a big foot?
it's the middle of winter in eastern dokdo.
As other people's reviews show, the electric heating wire is only 110 × 80 net and the arrangement is not vertical but horizontal.
I wanted to warm the whole futon evenly, so I bought it because it was more expensive than the laid type, but it was better to have a big one, but I can not check it at the store like a famous manufacturer, so I guess it can not be helped.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and N warm of ○ tori.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
it's good.
It is small and has sufficient airflow.
Batteries can also be replaced with spare ones.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it is better to do it as shown in the photo.
If it is a smooth desk, it will be blown away by your own wind, but if you lay a handkerchief, there is no problem.
If you use it outside or at a family restaurant, you won't notice the sound even if it's "inside", but in the office, even if it's "small", it's not noisy.
It is necessary to divide it as a companion when going out.
Also, for office use, even if it is "small", the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It is ideal for a scene where you sweat a lot on the go and escape to a family restaurant and cool down at once with "big".
However, when you throw it in your bag, the power button is pressed and you may leave it spinning without knowing it.
It would be nice to have a device such as slightly retracting the button (capsing it) or holding down the weak point of the first press.
It is a must-have item in the hot days when life is in danger, so it would be helpful if you could make better things.
Multifunctional light speaker
I use the weakest warm color and put it in my bedroom.
It's better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color by touch.
The white color suits any room, and the color light changes with the gradation, so it is beautiful.
Also, if you touch the color you like, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it glow according to your mood!
Since it is an LED type, a long life can be expected.
As for the sound quality, I think that it is a level that is more than enough for my ears as an amateur.
What's great about this light is that it's multifunctional.
There is a large speaker at the top.
You can enjoy music wirelessly because it can be paired with a mobile phone etc.
You can also make hands-free calls by pairing with a mobile phone.
In addition, since it supports MicroSD, it can also be linked with a computer and can play music as an mp3 player.
Uchikomi and piano practice
At the age of 66, he started to challenge DTM to prevent blurring.
I bought an audio interface and this unit.
At first, I was practicing hard, but I became addicted to playing the piano, so I spend all my time practicing.
I downloaded the sound source, but the protection didn't go well, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but I use it for piano practice because the free piano sound source sounds good.
I'm glad I bought it.
There is a feeling of being deceived by the appearance.
Is it a product that misses the mark?
It will be a long sentence.
The synthetic leather of the office chair (pump-up armrest) made of Doushisha, which had been used for four to five years, deteriorated and became tattered, so we considered purchasing it with a non-synthetic leather chair with a bounce-up armrest.
I searched for a home center and a furniture store, but I didn't find anything suitable.
I was worried that I couldn't check the actual product, but I compromised on the appearance and price of the design and bought this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
there's one spare screw.
[Note] The attached hex wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I couldn't see the oil sticking to the hex wrench, and the body was white, so I was impatient when the oil got on.
The assembly was completed in 40 minutes.
Completed and confirmed the product.
The lifting armrest is different in the hardness of raising and lowering on the left and right, the left is heavy for raising and lowering, the right is light, and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest has a weak fixing force and hangs down immediately with a "click" sound.
The seat feels hard with non-recycled high density urethane foam, and it is not comfortable to sit (weak elasticity?
The competition mesh on the backrest part is harder than other companies' mesh chairs, and if you wear light clothes, your back will hurt.
Although it is a small thing, the height from the seat to the ground was 530 instead of 550 (the height of the seat is important for height) And the caster support leg part is not made of steel, so the durability remains questionable.
A cushion purchased separately is laid, and the mesh fabric part is used with a towel because it seems to deteriorate (damage) quickly.
I felt that only the fit of the back was good for me of 186 cm 80 kg, but other than that, I think that it is a product with low satisfaction, I feel that it is a product with a misalignment.
After all, it may be better to sit down and buy an office chair after seeing the actual thing.
I received a purchase greeting Amazon email from the manufacturer, so should I inquire about the armrest and headrest?
It is under consideration.
Well, I wonder if it is like this.
In my home environment, it seems that I can see the right turning BS4K, so I bought a Pixera 4K tuner that was cheap without much expectation.
As an experiment, I was able to watch free right-turned broadcasts such as NHK BS4K, and I was able to watch it beautifully on Panasonic's 4K TV that I bought at the same time.
(Sometimes the image is jerky) The update came immediately after purchase, and it became recording support, so I made some pre-recorded recordings and watched it, but the external 2.5-inch HDD may be affected, only the image stops during playback, frame skipping occurs, etc.
The user interface was not praised by any means, and it is divided as "4K broadcasting can be seen".
By the way, during the pre-recorded recording, it seems that you can only follow the recorded program, and I accept this as a positive function that you can record in 4K on HDD.
You may be disappointed if you buy it with various expectations, so do not expect too much.
We hope it will be improved with the update.
it's okay to keep it warm.
I have only used the heat retention function yet, but when I put two 500 ml plastic bottles in it, it became warm in about 2 hours and it became hot in 2 and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but the fan sound is worrisome when idling stops, but I do not feel it at all while driving.
Because it was still new, I was worried about the smell of chemical substances emitted from the fan, so I needed to open the window regularly and ventilate it.
As another person wrote in the review, the burr of the part where the shoulder string is passed is terrible, so it is necessary to fold the burr with a minus screwdriver etc.
it's really fragile.
Today, two months after I started using it, it suddenly broke.
I liked the feeling of typing and the size, but it doesn't make sense if it breaks.
I use a PC all day for video processing work, but the volume goes up to 100% without permission.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
I can't use the earphones because my ears hurt, and the volume is so loud that I can't even use a PC at night.
It seems to be sending a signal every few seconds, and the volume display appears and disappears on the computer screen repeatedly.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, so you can not use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard each time.
The Enter key and Backspace key are no longer responsive.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's for a thousand yen, you may want to try it out.
If you are lucky, you will be able to use it for about half a year.
This is a six-month warranty compared to other companies' one- to three-year warranty even in the same price range.
The short warranty period speaks of its fragility.
the product is the best, the packaging is the worst.
The product is my favorite because I love it in different colors.
I would like to recommend it to those who are looking for food stockers!!
However, there was a gap enough to roll around in a large cardboard box, and there was no delivery note, and the packaging was the worst.
When I opened the box, the lid was also removed.
The product is recommended, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
i'm worried about the strength, but for now
When I replaced the lid, I bought it because the support became uneasy.
It plays a role in the stability of the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you do not be careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make a unpleasant sound like "I'm going to break".
You have to choose the one that fits the thickness of the lid, so be careful when purchasing.
a bag with a cute meat ball.
When I was looking for a bag to go out with a dog, I was attracted to a fashionable bag of gray color and I was allowed to buy this.
It was a built-in stand-up type, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so it felt not so heavy even if I held it.
The fastener also moves smoothly and there is no such thing as a catch.
It seems to be easy even if you travel for a long time.
It is very compact and easy to fold.
Even if you fold it, you can see the design of the meat ball, and it is cute even if you put it.
Light and comfortable!
the pulley's really nice to use.
First of all, I fell in love with the appearance and the low price at first sight and bought it immediately!
TSA lock is my favorite for the past few years and I have a few other things, but it's convenient.
And as a master of forgetting or losing the key, number lock is recommended.
However, to be honest, I put the most important point on lightness, so it's fine, but if you ask for durability and security, the zipper part is a week, because it is a cloth, it will break in an instant if it is cut.
Also, since the zipper is sweet, I want a device to overlap.
It is recommended to carry it on board if you are overseas.
For the time being, I used it for a trip on the Shinkansen, but it was comfortable.
It's difficult to choose the size...
It's hard to buy shoes because they are wide.
Converse or buns are wearing 24 cm.
MRL 996 is also 24 cm.
At first, I thought it was tough, but once I got used to it, I was fine.
The ML574 this time was certainly tough when my sister said that 24.5 cm was tight and I was allowed to wear it.
It felt like my little finger hit me.
Therefore, I bought 25 cm.
When I arrived and opened it, it was big...
When I put it on, it loosens up a little even if I wear socks.
I was worried about whether to return it, but if it becomes tight at 24.5, it will be troublesome, so I will put it in 25 as it is and wear it.
I bought a team red, and it's bright red and very good!
There are many black and white monotone clothes, so if you wear this, it will be bright!
165 cm, male in his 40s.
I ordered the L size at random, but if you are similar to the following specifications, I recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm A typical metabolic belly.
< How to use > In the water, the rush guard will turn up, probably because the waist part is loose.
I am swimming while fixing the turned up part.
Especially when you are careless in the jacuzzi, your metabolic syndrome belly is fully visible.
Also, if you walk while moving up and down violently, you will still turn up from the bottom.
The fabric is strong and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples being transparent.
At this price, you can be satisfied with this construction, but I think that it will fit better if you buy a smaller one.
there was a gas leak, after all.
Silver Colt 25 still had a gas leak, there was a problem that a part of the tank was missing when changing the valve, but the trick to disassembling is to seal the tank with the thumb of the left hand and remove the left side, I was able to disassemble it without the parts flying, When you want to buy this Colt 25, you can ask someone who can disassemble or assemble it, or you can not disassemble it while taking a digital camera photo, so it is not recommended for those who are not confident, but it may be fun for those who think that it can be broken I also bought another black Colt 25, the trick to disassemble is to remove the left side while holding the trigger with the thumb of the left hand, I managed to disassemble it without the parts flying, When assembling it, I can not remove the screw on the left side of the inner barrel with the spring and fine parts.
i was wondering what kind of quality 188 yen was.
It can be used for fast turning and when torque is required.
It is light and small, and above all, simplicity without vanity is good.
There was no rattling when I installed the bit, and I thought it would be an amazing cost if it was 188 yen.
The rest is about durability.
It may not be used very often, but I think it is good to put it in the tool box.
I bought it together with "1 / 4 inch hexagonal shank magnetic quick release driver lowlet bit holder 60 / 100 / 150 mm" from the same distributor.
There was no problem here, or rather, it was quite good for the price.
the controller won't work.
i can't control it.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the machine moves in a different direction and cannot be operated.
This product is better not to buy.
i'll give you a warning.
It's a terrible product.
Although it is wired, I recommend the controller of BEBONCOOL PS3.
It is highly reliable and has not yet broken even after long use.
It can also be used for PC games.
Postscript I was able to refund the Amazon gift certificate by returning it as a defective product within a month, so I think that was good.
is this going to improve your computing power?
I think it's suitable for children who understand calculation.
Wouldn't it be impossible for a child to understand calculation to some extent?
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, when I give the tools to the master, I slide the things on the screen up with my fingers, but I tried it myself, but it didn't go smoothly no matter how many times I did it.
In short, it may be easy to slide for those who are used to DS.?
I don't like the illustrations of manga characters, or rather, I think that DS etc. may enter from the fun of the screen... but for some reason I don't feel familiar.
The method of calculation is also a way of competing for time, for example, how many questions are correct in how many minutes.
I know it's tempting to rush through an exam or something, but don't you rush into calculating?
I don't like the sound of the gong when it's over.
Why don't you make it sound more pleasant even though you're working hard?
I feel like I lost 6,200 yen with this.
I know if it's half price.
I'm sorry, I ended up with two pieces of fish.
Persona's songs are really good!
Persona 3 reaches ED.
5 played until the middle.
Persona 4 has already been troconned in vita.
What I can do hasn't changed since Persona 4 in the previous work.
Because there is no story, it feels shorter than the previous work.
The song is really cool!
Just listening to it will make you feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I first saw them.
Somehow Junpei looked handsome (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so there is no freshness...
As for the sound game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see if the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if you wear it with the background.
There are plenty of assist functions, so I think that even those who are not good at sound games can play.
If you are a sound game expert, you may turn on the challenge function to make the game more challenging.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not a bonus, it's a solid four-disc set, so if you like persona songs, I recommend this one.
i'm sorry.
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual thing is blue, but it is close to black or charcoal gray.
And it was not a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but I wonder if I can give up because the pending price is cheap so far?
Postscript After the review was posted, I received an email from the seller apologizing and exchanging it for a new product.
The subsequent processing was also quick.
I think the response was very good even though it was a cheap product.
Added 4 stars to the correspondence After that, I also bought gold.
The color is almost as shown in the photo and I think it is very beautiful.
However, the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the description photo is obvious.
That's the only regret.
The evening will be very heavy.
I used it for the SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setup, I didn't know how to do it after I arrived in Korea and pointed to the SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (Settings & Gt; Mobile communication & Gt; Turn on data roaming from the communication option) and I did it well.
It seems that the instruction attached to the product did not have much to do with...?
However, the area around Gimpo Airport has been grasping 3G for a long time, probably because of the poor radio wave condition.
When I went out into the city, it became 4G.
In the evening and at night, the communication sometimes became very heavy, but now that I think about it, I may have reached the maximum limit of hundreds of MB per day.
it's better than i thought.
I used the SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, made it sim-free and used it with Ymobile, and the Z4 got sick, so I was looking for a second-hand Xperia phone, but I found this new phone that can be used as a saifu-mobile and bought it.
I was using a mobile Suica, so I was worried if I could use it properly, but it was not a problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so it looks like an iPhone 6 at a glance.
Since it does not play games, the processing speed is the same as the Z4, and I have the impression that it is a little faster. In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition is slow, but it seems that it takes a little time to recognize, so facial recognition is faster, so I use it here.
I thought it was amazing because it looked like an iPhone.I also made Android Ver9, and I was able to shop satisfactorily.
What I'm worried about It's a little smaller, it doesn't have a good strap hole ※ It's compatible with a case with a strap hole I haven't tested water resistance It's a little heavy I've only used a little, but I'm satisfied I recommend it
