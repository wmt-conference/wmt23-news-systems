Diego Cocca becomes the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprising appointment as national coach caused trouble at the club.
Geesthacht: New flower bed signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht is blooming" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is flourishing" is an action of Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. Since 2015, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth with the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions. Goal: In the Geesthacht urban area, flowering islands are to be created over a wide area, on which insects will find food at any time. "When the weather is favorable, the bees fly out in January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Nabu in Geesthacht. He has hives on the property himself.
To ensure that the project not only remains an action by conservationists and the city's environmental service, but also draws wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory panels are repeatedly placed on the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. Passers-by should be able to find out in this way what is blooming so beautifully here right now. The hope is that amateur gardeners will specifically replant at home.
In the first week of January, the season had already started at the Wildhasel
More recently, shrubs such as winter scented hedge cherry and winter snowball are in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the buckets on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, are just showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given further signs. "The winter fragrant hedge cherry is a very broad-bushed shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide, " can be read there among other information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that not only the bed plants now show flowers. In the first week of January, the season had already started at the Wildhasel. It blooms especially abundantly on the straightening path at the slope, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many bends.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Quilting keeps me young"
Munich - Dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of you when he looks down from the sky to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at exactly 15 o'clock for a brisk tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich-born von der Schwanthaler Höh (January 15, 1921), "Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and quilting is my life, I can't imagine myself without it".
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in Jena (Thuringia) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today one would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life dancing, acting and singing".
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the round of tap dancers. She says: "We are just having fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the USA in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the wooden soles used at first, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are created during dancing that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, we welcome big and small, old and young".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "The movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol".
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitization progresses, the desire for analog is growing again for some
The speed with which our everyday life became digital left us hardly any time to set up rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen in 1985, there were three possibilities. Either you were one of the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call the relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or they went to a phone booth. The smell of the plastic receiver and the click of the coins in the machine will not be forgotten. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other's face when calling - videotelephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
How to continue in Moldova? 14 Days for a new Government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), the President Maia Sandu has entrusted the former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with the formation of the government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do this. Previously, Recean was one of the president's advisers.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned unexpectedly. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure., as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is Ukraine's neighbor country and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Chisinau parliament, the pro-European PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) party, founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, the pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
2023 will be celebrated properly again in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities could not be asked for a long time.
Landesvater Markus Söder did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side is wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister of Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the Paw Patrol's child hero Chase for his costume.
Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely detached: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, is drawn into space.
State parliament President Ilse Aigner was looking for no one less than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Minister of Health Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob der Baumeister aka Bauminister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden Boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She was wearing silver.
He even plays the sheriff at Carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side wife Gerswid.
On the roll: Minister of Economic Affairs Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the craft with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district administrator of the district of Regensburg, does the same to him.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missing either.
All for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
The SPD parliamentary group leader's passion is hiking: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
It was made Royal by FDP parliamentary group leader Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, the chairman of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime. At his side Mrs. Andrea.
If things don't work out with politics anymore, he can at least do magic. Nürnberg's OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermione.
Flying fast as a bee: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR Artistic Director Katja Wildermuth and BR Cultural Programme Director Björn Wilhelm.
A little side blow against the climate activists by the Franconian crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First mayor of Veitshöchheim could not be missing either. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Bold eighth in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has already collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to join his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partly heavy fog did not prevent long-time winner Bö from collecting his second gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay team had already successfully defended its title.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so that he can compensate shooting errors frighteningly easily to a certain extent.
Meanwhile, nothing was going on with Doll again. After the veteran had given up all chances for a medal at the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and had only placed sixth, things did not go better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in prone shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago, he surprisingly won by a razor-thin margin of 0.7 seconds over Bö. It was one of only three career successes of Doll, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Olympic eighth from Beijing left without a word after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Championship debutant David Zobel took 35th place.
Biden welcomes Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is mainly about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden has insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said at the White House in Washington on Friday. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength". With regard to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: "Brazil has isolated itself for four years".
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a run-off election at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by serious riots. Supporters of Bolsonaro stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a gloomy reminder of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, during which supporters of then-President Donald Trump forcibly entered the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro during the meeting with Biden. His predecessor had not given much on international relations. "His world started and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "Sounds familiar to me," Biden replied - an obvious allusion to his predecessor Trump.
A short note about the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF search posters? The members of the Red Army faction released for denunciation and firing were then seen.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, such public sentiment was made against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually after Raudis in the suburban trains or onanists in the park, is giving a new edition with the "war criminal" to Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world that includes Asia, Africa and Latin America than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, but: In 1st to 5th place (!) if Mrs. Wagenknecht is standing, then Mrs. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I no longer know anyone in my environment who reads this sheet. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the well-known level, where there is nothing below.
And at the latest now, well dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and antimilitarist people. (And here no differentiation is necessary anymore.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It reads: "I can confirm that my client, through his family lawyer, has submitted an application to the competent court for the termination of his civil partnership. I don't comment on details".
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, separation rumors had been around for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved to Berlin from the shared house in the Palatinate, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems on the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: last survivor dead
A memorial center was established in 1999 in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, the ruins of which have been preserved. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had campaigned for Franco-German youth encounters.
A cornering location for 14 houses: everyone knows everyone in Homeien
Northern Lippish Hamlets: It is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof in homes. Here the residents will find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles a day race the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup for a long time - and some even come back right away.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing believes that further interest rate hikes are "absolutely" necessary in the fight against the high inflation rate. "The inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy may rise slightly again, and the opening of China may also temporarily give prices a boost," Sewing told Welt am Sonntag.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and promised a further increase of another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area is now at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when parking money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher lending rates can lead to investments being postponed and thus economic growth being weaker.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we have to keep this in mind, but a high debt level should not prevent the ECB from acting consistently".
The ECB is aiming for price stability with an inflation rate of two percent for the euro area in the medium term. This target mark has been far away for months. Although price inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharply increased energy prices, which are significantly driving inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "collapse sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "I currently see this as the biggest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario".
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) for infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And maybe he will also be a little more controversial,"he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out, with which it does not necessarily have to go as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation at the turn of the year - but also not as slowly as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply to a certain extent due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany pace". In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government is acting so quickly when it matters. But this should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will," Hartung said. There must therefore still be a negotiation process about what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, people have tried and failed with the classic set of rules. "We should think again whether the previous procedure was really right. Maybe we overdid it with the set of rules and made it too complicated for us".
However, in view of the many open tasks, such as the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible".
Trade union warns against breaking up the Bayer Group
The chemical trade union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the group after an announced change of CEO at Bayer. "From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three mainstays, is perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future," Francesco Grioli, a member of the union's Executive Board and Bayer's Supervisory Board, told the Rheinische Post (Saturday edition).
This includes the pharmaceutical business with prescription medicines, the consumer Health business with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "The transformation of industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism".
The background is the change of CEO at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will leave the post this summer. The former head of pharmaceuticals at Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has been criticized for a long time. The acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for $ 63 billion, which was completed in 2018, depends on the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into the house. The Bayer share has been in decline for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. The pressure was put on by long-term strategic investors. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also joined in. Bluebell is pushing for a split of the group, according to a media report.
The very small fund with an unknown amount of investment in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A spin-off of "the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the "Rheinische Post". On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop science agricultural division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are opposing the concentrated protest on the street to a government project. Hundreds of thousands are planning to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected again nationwide on Saturday, who want to demonstrate against the planned pension reform of President Emmanuel Macron. For the fourth time, the trade unions are mobilizing against the plans of the central government to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. More than a million people have already taken to the streets twice and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants were counted in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in parliament for a week now.
Many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid in long enough for a no-deductible pension when they reach the age limit. The opponents of the reform believe that people could hardly work longer in many strenuous professions. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not wear out their health completely on the job.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older and older, the employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the amount of the pension to be kept stable, the population had to work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But it's not just the retirement age that the government wants to screw up. The increase in the required deposit period for a full pension, which was already decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension should increase to about 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of the most important projects of President Macron. During the corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron have already tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - everyone was sure of widespread protests and strikes.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to pass the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced support. But some of the members - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote, Macron's concern about crippling strikes is likely to be even greater at the moment. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they proceeded calmly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather awaits - lots of sun in high altitudes
A powerful high pressure area is located over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that there is a lot of sunshine to be expected everywhere?
in Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "True, this high will shift a little to the east over the next week. But it still determines the weather in Germany".
However, calm high-pressure weather does not necessarily mean sunny weather in winter, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands dreary high fog gray for days, while there is pure sun in the high altitudes of the low mountains".
So Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it can also rain a little from the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up during the day and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or highly foggy. The temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the gradually getting stronger sun will nibble on the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more over the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sun is expected all day, elsewhere it must first fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine are expected by 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, only by 3 degrees are expected. For this, a weak wind blows from different directions.
On Tuesday, there may again be only a tenuous dissolution of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather is cheerful after the fog has cleared. According to the forecasts, the sun shines all day long in high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps. The temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator hadert: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia has shown herself to be seriously disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine Skiing World Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't put in the performance that I can," the Italian told ZDF after she had threaded in at a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races of the season in this discipline. After gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. But Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, will have to keep waiting for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline. She missed her home match in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second," Goggia said after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel nun. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's how life is". Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said about the medal expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not".
Missing girls in Berlin: who saw Viktoriya?

Zelenskyi and Minister against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
It was agreed on a joint conference call to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė said.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made the position of Great Britain very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus cannot be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now make a joint statement on this issue".
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other senior representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia is killing and terrorizing, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Zelensky said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag is soaked with blood and cannot be carried.
Ukraine threatens to boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a war party, because the country provides military bases for attacks to Russian troops. Zelensky called on the officials to work for the protection of the Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has unfortunately lost its "honesty".
The occasion of the conference was the announcement of the IOC to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for Sports, subsequently stated that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it would refuse to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in Paris. "From our point of view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's efforts to re-admit the Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior said on dpa's request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January: "The sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Big sporting events do not take place in a vacuum". Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is striving for the return of athletes from both countries to the international sports arena under a neutral flag, provided that they clearly commit to the Olympic charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or the place of birth" violates the prohibition of discrimination.
Chalk up where it happens
"Hey, horny butt!", whistling after the fool in a tight sexy costume and shouting salacious sayings: all this falls under the concept of "catcalling" (eng. Cat calls). The term conceals nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public space.
Lost half of the vehicles? : US sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
Lost half of the vehicles? U.S. sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. We are talking about the "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army was "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
At an online event organized by the Center for a New American Security think tank, Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed, according to the US assessment.
Ukraine is expected to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. The UK has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2 main battle tanks for March. Germany, in a coalition with other states, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The US has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, in all likelihood, their delivery will take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev announced the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging for planes, missiles, tanks abroad," Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the Russian Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks".
Already since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more focused on the needs of the army. Thus, for example, individual industries can be obliged to supply the Armed forces.
Whirl around the staffing of posts at Heer
Because the post that the former director of the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Minister of Defense Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
According to the minister, a call for tenders is not necessary because the appointment to a previously vacant job is taking place. She would not comment on the "speculation of a liberal staff representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. These are cleared from Tanner's point of view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision was based on the "appearance of Postenschacher", says SPÖ defence spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for National Defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the topic.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees before costs
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for safety, among other things, are also difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total costs for the move.
There are no carnival parades in Brandenburg. The "train of cheerful people" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. Even at the Swabian-Alemannic Shrovetide, no parades were canceled.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We are going through our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claussen. But here, too, the financial worries are pressing: if more sponsors were not found or the previous ones were heading even more, reserves would have to be touched - "this is not possible every year". The current deficit is about 200,000 euros.
And the inflation: there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent for the confectionery, says Elvira Reuther from the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. Due to luck in misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. For the move, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. Twice as many staff will be needed for security as in 2020.
If you are standing on the wayside on the Rose Monday train in the Rhineland, you could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have so much with them. Camelle or not, the crowd of visitors is likely to be large: "I think that if it doesn't rain out of buckets on that day, then we can definitely expect an increased crowd of people," says Holger Kirsch, the Cologne train manager. "This is due to the fact that there has not been a regular Rose Monday procession for two years. The train, of course, can not be replaced by anything".
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail. However, the train is generally "deficit", that is no secret.
The Ukraine diary: dreams and homemade vodka
Ukrainians are not considered to be drinking for nothing. There are domestic beers such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other big breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can not notice a big difference in taste. The same applies to the vodka, which is widely used. They burn it here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can also see here how little you can believe the Russians. It is said that as a tourist you should be careful with it. But this only applies if he goes on mass sale. There will probably be cheating there too.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: "Match luck on our side"
Food and Drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer at the end of the day, you will find great restaurants for this in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glow for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: President sees favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by master chimney sweep Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the awarding of medals at the Oberhof World Championship sprint. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to tell from the official gallery on Saturday whether the windows at the shooting range were really falling. "I had to get the results on my mobile phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile and referred to the clouds of fog that kept moving into the stadium, which severely impaired the visibility on the race track for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, got numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by biathlon," he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say that - with thanks to those who have been working here since the World Cup was awarded". Also in terms of sustainability, the location is now "one step ahead of many others" and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades".
Once again, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö missed out on the competition in terms of sports. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap / 39.9 seconds) and Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory perfectly.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wicks triumph. Johannes Kühn took eighth place as the best German after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed effort on Wednesday, the Black Forest player left five discs standing this time and disappeared into the cabin as the 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö had entered the race with the number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However: in his last two standing shots he had the luck of the proficient; they each landed on the edge of the panes and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes".
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. For women, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one,"said sporting director Felix Bitterling, taking his "locomotive" to task. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the court
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on the referee's ball.
Aggressive starting players or complaining coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Head of referees Fröhlich points to a role model function.
The German top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the interaction on the pitch. "I think there are new behaviors of the players that surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German press Agency. "We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike things. We will pay more attention to this again - and we will also sanction it".
Recently, two coaches had also been given space referrals. The Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, the league defeat in Dortmund was yellow-red. "The coaching behavior also falls into the area of unsportsmanlike behavior. We noticed that unsportsmanlike behavior has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanlike things," Brych said.
The head of the DFB referees, Lutz Michael Fröhlich, pointed to a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and impartial people. "Overall, the ratio fits. There are reactions, which are followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned must then live with this. That shouldn't be anything earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the German press Agency.
"Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal vilification, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referees," Fröhlich said. In the most recent cases, the parties involved would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if a rethinking process were to get underway that such behavior simply should not be heard," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible effects on another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a model effect, imitation results from it. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviors," Fröhlich said. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful".
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro in front of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Kristjan Ilves from Estonia was third.
The German combiners are not competing at their best in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not there. They are preparing for the World Championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven slightly injured after rear-end collision on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident with four vehicles on highway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhine-Neckar district), including two children. According to a statement from the police, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist hit a car from behind during a slight tailback and pushed it onto two other cars. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours.
Finissage at the Marler Skulpturenmuseum
Initiated the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (li.) and Georg Elben (re.) standing with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marl Sculpture Museum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage for the exhibition "Wandgebunden" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 15 o'clock in the transitional quarter of the Marl Sculpture Museum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. In three exhibition rooms, two large-format murals each attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over, the works of art disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created especially for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. On the basis of numerous examples of paintings, she presents the peculiarities of wall painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the lines of connection to this art genre in the Federal Republic, with a focus on the North Rhine-Westphalia of the 1950s to 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate on the wall painting of the Weimar Republic in 2013. Since then, she has been conducting research on building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art at construction in NRW. After the lecture, the last curator's tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists are on site.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings: in the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued an arrest warrant for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In the south of Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after buildings collapsed during the earthquake. Arrest warrants were issued against 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, citing law enforcement officials. The accused should be responsible for construction defects that would have favored the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of this investigation, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. According to the information, one of the accused was arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He allegedly tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early on Monday morning, a magnitude 7.7 quake had shaken the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another magnitude 7.6 quake at noon. More than 7,500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
The penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow has died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left faction in the Bundestag announced. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Parliamentary group chairman Dietmar Bartsch praised the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away from us at the age of 95," the left faction in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party is thus losing "an important personality," said the group chairman Dietmar Bartsch and the former group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the People's Chamber elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow took office a month later. He was followed by Lothar de Maizière as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politicians.
The leader of the Left party, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and militant socialist". Bartsch added:
"Until old age, he was an important adviser in our party, whose prudence will be lacking".
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was just a special merit of his. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. It goes on to say:
"His later work in the Volkskammer, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated".
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
As stated in a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow had seen the new state "quite critically". According to dpa, Modrow criticized in many interviews that German unity had been completed too quickly, that the GDR had fallen down too unconditionally, and that it had been condemned as an "unjust state" too unilaterally.
What happened in the night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev has to carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian rocket attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs on Ukraine's energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants were damaged, the head of the Ukrenerho energy supplier, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The situation with the power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant, and production was curtailed at the Rivne and Southern Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. But in a video message, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bakhmut
On February 24th there will be a war for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to the important Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger from Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, air alarm was triggered late on Friday evening for the fifth time for this day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kiev region said. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal Government selects consultants for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, from the election campaign to split them off failed due to the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, they had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. This means that it does not need to generate and transfer any profits.
Restructuring backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government to accompany this process. The renovation backlog on the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very punctually. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem by completely renovating entire rail corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by the railway, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
Apparently, the external circumstances did not speak for Herrmann-Wick at all. She would have slept badly, she told after the race, was "totally excited", the pulse did not come down even when running in. "Such a race," and that at the Home World Cup, "you can't describe it with words," she said. 11,000 Spectators cheered to the booming schlager music with German flags, the supervisors and the team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", that's what she had set out to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old started the World Championship as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. She currently ranks fifth in the Overall World Cup. And even though the performance density is significantly higher for the women in the top than for the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, there were more others on the list for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison in Nicaragua
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been very tense since 2018. At that time, protesters demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people were killed in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiring with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Armaments industry demands more orders from special funds
The first armament projects have therefore already been cancelled, further projects are threatened by the same, as the "Welt am Sonntag" reports. However, it is not yet possible to say exactly which investments would be eliminated. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at the present time," says a response from the federal government to a request from Member of the Bundestag Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The reason for the falling investment amount is the rising interest rates. The special fund, which was fully financed by loans and which the Bundestag had decided on in June 2022, must bear the interest charges for the loans itself. If these increase, there is therefore less money available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum decreases.
Kupferzell: accident with 3 injured
On the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell motorway entrance towards Heilbronn on the motorway. At that time, a 21-year-old VW driver was driving the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police announced. During the turning of the BMW driver there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system revealed no complaint. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident. They had to be hospitalized in a hospital. A total of approximately 20,000 euros of property damage was caused to the two cars.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
The world is preoccupied with the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. On Friday evening, more than 200 people thought of the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the imam's supplication in earnest and in silence. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The municipality also asked for help and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands by the side of the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial event. The supplications were also translated into German on the palace Square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already come together at the fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Türisch-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind in the Glockenstraße over several days, which are to be brought by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hiking with a meat insert - Ebersberg
"After dinner you should rest or take a thousand steps ".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has experienced an unimagined renaissance. Because if you are not sitting in the middle of a stone desert thanks to your home office, but rather just a stone's throw away from a field, forest and meadow, you can now use your lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or alternatively for a walk in the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around Lake Egglburg, where not only dog owners are frolicking between 12 and 14 o'clock.
Of course, one reason could also lie in the fact that modern people can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of optimal time slot use. Because why not learn about the news from the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor on the occasion of a short march through nature? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? In this way, work and private life could also be combined - who says that the appointment with a tax consultant, lawyer or investment consultant cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course.
What can also be done excellently is the acquisition of natural materials. Fresh fruit, for example, which is next to cheese on a table by the wayside. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid only if you have not thought about the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. For example, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden salesroom empty-handed and with regret in their voices. "It's a pity, unfortunately we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, because you yourself have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you can also let the sympathetic random acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! You probably have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which you quickly threw on before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always puts everything in there!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with a meat insert and during this short lunch trip you have become richer not only by a lamb's back, but also by a very practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due on this day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
At about 21 o'clock, the 25-year-old was driving his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and, for an unknown reason, came off the road in a left turn to the right, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a guide post, hit a tree on the side and stopped a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The ambulance service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of driving incapacity, the collection of a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, total damage of 1000 euros was caused to the Audi.
Donald Trump's Tax Documents: A point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has decided: the tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in the office of the President of the USA
The Ministry of Finance must instruct the tax authority IRS to hand over the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, according to the ministry's decision on Friday.
Contrary to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted a release until the Supreme Court. A prosecutor's office in New York has received the documents in the meantime, but no details were allowed to be made public - unless there was a trial.
The disclosure to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: there the circle of authorized persons is slightly larger and under certain conditions individual details could be published during the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information is constantly leaking from Parliament to the outside.
The chairman of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their undermining of our security as president," Pelosi said.
Cabaret in the Bastion: life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves of time, today's people rush from appointment to appointment and sometimes push people and hamburgers in between just like that. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting.
Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life in a humorous and thoughtful way. In her sensitive chansons and crisp, pointed cabaret songs, she gets a lot straight to the point - and one or the other is also between the lines. It starts on Saturday, February 18, at 20.30 clock in the Kirchheim Club Bastion.
British felon caught in Thailand after long flight
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from the UK has been caught in Thailand. According to the British Criminal Police NCA on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police at a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the NCA's most wanted criminals.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled at the beginning of 2018 before the start of a court case in which he had been sentenced to eleven years in prison in absentia for attempted import of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Meetings at the church table
in Bielefeld
What is served up remains a secret in advance. Because people should come to the Vespers Church primarily to meet others, not because there is something specific on the menu. It starts on this Sunday, then the Neustadt St. Mary's Church becomes a dining room for two weeks.
Cabaret Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, is breaking a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits in with this. It remains to be seen whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic scepticism about science here. In any case, his humor fits very well to Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can do- and most importantly, what it can't. Of course, corona also occurs there, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering skills.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people put in front of them: what is really important? All this with a huge wink, unobtrusively and very ironically. And so not only are they entertained well, but they can also learn something new along the way.
Please go to typing... this does not take long, does not hurt and can save the lives of many people.
My phone is ringing with an unknown number. I suppose. This woman is the honest finder of your wallet.
The Nordcon team also writes: "In contrast to our old location, we only have a very few stairs left.

Ten firefighters and two policemen were seriously injured in the explosion, some of them seriously.
Can I dismiss everything as harmless quirkiness. You don't do that to children.
It's a good thing that city politics has known the advantages for decades and has never questioned them.

I really don't understand why you don't do such events on Sundays. Or not in the city.
What doesn't the #Bahn actually do to scare away customers and spoil the image even more!?
Awesome how well #LuisaNeubauer puts it in a nutshell. We need exactly such people. Thank you Luisa!
Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard details and prices of monetization <url> #DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of various stripes are traveling together for the first time (!) to Germany.
I am curious who I will meet there and who I will get to know there ;-)
Party colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer elf, as well as the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, she is also a CDU minister.
So this is really nothing new, this is the case with every electronic ticket. Check-in/checkout is another house number.
Certainly no reason to do anything about the tax evasion of 150 billion euros per year in Germany alone.
Is someone playing #wortify and found the word with all the letters today? If so, please let me know, this is driving me crazy.

1. General information
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the combat events from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which provide the player with temporary protection, since they cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which, during the extended gameplay, are increasingly difficult to hit. In addition, UFO's appear at periodic intervals. They cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by a UFO hit. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction process, the game introduction process, the game Abl, the initial input for highest results and the self-test process. The latter mode of operation represents a special procedure for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4. Game process
The game process is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks, which become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by observing the displayed text in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. For example, a hint may be: OPPONENTS FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, a dot representing the enemy position becomes visible on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the field of view of the player on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he should be well targeted on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMIES IN the FIRE AREA are displayed in the upper left warning display at the same time.
At times, UFO's flying over the battlefield become visible on the screen. These are safe missiles that observe the combat situation and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player tank. The flying position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the combat and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. A shot by the player brings him 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a rocket and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and spins twice as fast as the player tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several possibilities give the set-up the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game process. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be released and for another more difficult game design, the appearance of the rocket can be varied. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector switch for this setting option can be found in the figure.
5. Initial entry for highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of the highest scores, HE or SHE can enter three (3) personal initials in the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that by triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector generator PCB or interrupting the mains voltage, the table with the highest results will be deleted. When clearing (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores are obtained with their initials and inscribed on the screen again to challenge more players. Any score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, dashes are automatically inscribed by the computer. After that, the device switches back to the attraction game process. ASSEMBLY ARRANGEMENT
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI gearshift lever. It was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, which made this structural unit more stable and ensured proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever into the center position. The microswitches are now fastened with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector generator and the auxiliary board. With the help of these switching technologies, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in a uniform and smooth image. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the expansion of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, which is intended as a pedestal for smaller players, in order to make it easier to play. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should carry out a certain check to round off the quality control. In order to be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V mains yet. A. Inspect the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the maintenance cover of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose plugs to each other.
NOTE: Never make plug connections by force. The plugs are provided with a forced guide, so that a correct connection is established. A connector connection twisted by 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the gaming PC board for correct and tight fit. (3) Note the production number of the device on the nameplate on the back of the device. Check whether the stamped production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, Controller/Audio II PC board and the TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be indicated when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for proper assembly. (5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange-circled opening of the fairing. If the opening is not exactly centered, the panel attached to the housing with an adhesive tape must be loosened and realigned. Before connecting the device to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the connector and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most of the problems related to current DirectX games. Checking the system configuration
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. With the help of the DirectX diagnostic program, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure whether your PC meets the requirements. To enter the DirectX diagnostic program, please follow these steps: click the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. In the text field, enter "dxdiag". The user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is now displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphics and sound card. Among other things, you can check whether the graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
It may happen that other programs take over the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not with all of these programs it is obvious that they are active, and many are started automatically when the system boots up. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. That's why we recommend that you quit such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, find the icon of the program in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable" "Close", or similar). - Once you have disabled the antivirus and crash Guard programs, you should also quit general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when installing or running a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to quit all unnecessary background applications". Cleaning up the system
Before installing software, it is necessary to make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. Therefore, you should make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need for this are included with Windows: use ScanDisk, defragmentation and disk cleanup to keep everything running fine. Then the chances are high that current games will run largely without problems on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you use otherwise run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows Help files to find out about the ScanDisk or error checking, defragmentation and Disk Cleanup tools. Using the Windows Help
1. Click the "Start" button and select the "Help" option (or "Help and Support", respectively) to access the Windows Help. 2. Now click in the Search field and enter the appropriate keyword, for example, "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Checking" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive a manual that explains how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure that you have the latest drivers for your video card. So you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First of all, you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the video card manufacturer. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS ABOUT FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games was sparked for me by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and seemed to me as a new means of expression, with the help of which one could push the world to its limits. It was an opportunity for me to explore new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be completely honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that the video games were only exploiting a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too eager for "action" and forgot about a fundamental element of the human world of experience: the sensations. Meanwhile, the technology continued to make rapid progress. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that conveys sensations. Even if this could of course have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can definitely create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but also has far more sophisticated and in-depth content. It is proof that you can tell a story as well as offer a game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or the interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are rather skeptical about video games, I can hope that Fahrenheit will help to change your attitude in this regard. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. The interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, during which we were repeatedly forced to question many of the principles that were previously considered irrefutable. I would consider myself lucky if Fahrenheit - similar to books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also does not pass by you completely without a trace. David Cage
THE README FILE
There is a ReadMe file on the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM where the license agreement and updated information about the game can be viewed.

Without knowledge in these areas, no repair of the electronic device part should be attempted. The electrical plans form the conclusion. We kindly ask you to carefully observe the instructions of this manual in order to ensure satisfactory operation of the machine.
The information and illustrations contained in this SERVICE MANUAL correspond to the status at the time of printing. SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN THE SENSE OF TECHNICAL PROGRESS, BUT NO OBLIGATION TO RETROFIT! Please note when setting up
Transport damage
As far as external transport damages are recognizable, they must be objected to immediately, recorded on a transport note and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railway, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage! Mains voltage
The device is set for the mains voltage indicated on the nameplate. For other mains voltages, the device transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched over. According to the VDE regulation, the device is provided with a protective conductor connection and is intended only for dry rooms. Proper operation of the coin system requires correct placement of the device in a horizontal and vertical position. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If at any time an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor, please turn off the machine for a short time (unplug it) and turn it on again. If the device does not work properly afterwards, a repair is necessary.
Before repairing, unplug the power plug! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch voltage-conducting parts! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still carry dangerous voltage. ATTENTION,HIGH VOLTAGE! There are about 20000 volts at the anode connection of the picture tube. Replace fuses only with fuses with the same values! A blown fuse signals an overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced with a higher-quality one, serious damage can be caused. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuits/connections when the device is switched on. SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Game Play
By pressing the corresponding start button, the game is started for one or (with a minimum credit of 2) for 2 players. It is necessary to try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game process is set in such a way that a minimum prescribed area must be occupied before you can tackle the next area (round). At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. In case of alarm, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, as long as you try to draw your territory, your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed, since you cannot cross your own path, or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will be plugged in and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. If the drawing speed is slow, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches can be reached.
The QIX game is able to check itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working properly. For more information, see "Service Program". The volume can be adjusted on the volume control on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing, the 4 switches - located in the device -, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming Display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The languages can be set with the help of the "Sub-test" switch. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Application programming. This indicator can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, a "maximum number of credits", which may be before the start of the game, can be set. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-test" switch (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times, the factory or basic setting can be reached when the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the green appearing lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display until "High hit rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs so that his own initials (names) and the hit points can be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, the coin acceptance is blocked - if there is a coin lock. This allows a limited number of games to be set for one player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by throwing in a coin, the credits cannot become zero when adding over 99. A free spin mode can be selected by setting "Maximum Number credits" to O. Further programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": height of the % number that must be reached to switch to the next pass
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": level of difficulty of the game process
"Dressing tone": no tone at "0" when stationary
with "1" sound even when stationary (animation sound) "Table model": with "0" stationary device
for "1" tabletop device
The credits per coin are set on the "Slot Programming" display. High-score program display (highest hit rate so far"). The player's hit points and initials will appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set to highscore, which were selected on the previous display (setting of "back"). By pressing the "Up" switch, the initials QIX Standard are set. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "overall evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts all over again. The total number can only appear at 0 when the battery or the plug-in connection W1 is removed, with the device switched off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted - in the left coin insertion slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted - in the right coin insertion slot. Credits paid: Number of credits given for discarded (revalued coins). Credits granted: Number of credits given by the device. % Free Spins: Credits granted (Credits Paid + credits granted per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes, in case of extended or won match. % Free time: Minutes gained/minutes played per 100. Average playing time in sec.: Minutes played/Credits paid + Credits granted
High Score (hit rate): Number of times a player had high enough hit rates to displace other players from the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears.
Slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the set-up can select a standard coin setting or program another setting
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-test" switch. After a single pressure, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that it is possible to set it yourself. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and changing only those values that are not suitable. As soon as the setting has been made, each new variable to be set can be selected by pressing the "Sub-test" switch. If you press it unintentionally, the default setting appears. The values can be increased or decreased with the "Up" and "Down" switches. The process is completed by pressing the "Test" switch. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") tells how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an associated slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" coin units shows the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min.-Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (Memory) FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored in dom, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to the factory default setting. This condition probably indicates failure or failure of the battery.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test' button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" switch, the next program is displayed in each case. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in the auto-test mode. With this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. When the display "Open Coin Door to Test" appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the J 19 connector is disconnected, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for this ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is faulty, U 10 is displayed first. If this test does not succeed, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as Banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoding connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the device stops with the above display, an error has been detected. If the communication RAM's fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by defective wiring (RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, detach the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: failure in the U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test has been passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or the decoding.
Check the video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are checked for correctness when they are read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, multiplexers and decoders connected to them.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared with the original sample. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next check is being started (Data hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without noticeable seam defects. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. I was guided by the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she is supposed to sit so tight and I didn't want to fight my way into an S or M with my bust size.... In the end, she would have been from the length and on the hip gepasst...im I could swim the rest. In addition, the lining material came to you when you opened the package and was distributed everywhere. Just a pity.. She will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered them for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and the 36 fits her quite well in this case and will certainly be worn next year as well. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the edition does not quite fit. But what is my mistake. Then I slightly changed something so that it fits. The pad looks very robust and the edges are no longer damaged. You can use the groove or the whole area. Worked without any problems. It doesn't slip anymore. I would buy again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself I quite okay, but not under a year. Since the area for chewing is much too large for the small mouth. We brought him when our son was 7 months and he could not use him for the purpose of size. Now at 12 months we have been looking for him out again and he can use him. He can't even bite with his existing teeth. And if he was in the refrigerator, it calms him down a lot.
Quality is not sufficient / Is unfortunately declining
I was probably blinded by the sometimes exuberant reviews here. I would like to send in advance that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. Due to the fact that I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. At Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, because I had read many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment followed: the backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that's just not true! I was really hoping that it would be like that, but there really can be no question of that. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. Alas, the separations inside are of a different caliber, much more labbrigeren. Overall, the feel of this backpack can not be compared with that of my Lowepro. Also the zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly high quality. That's why I decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy an equipment of many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to take the money for a reasonable backpack in my hand. Apparently, quality has its price here. For someone who does not want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not that the decision was difficult for me either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that he was going back. What I really liked is the color inside. Here you will certainly find your things much faster than with a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is definitely a great thing, but mine is declining.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far I had liked the electrics series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and I was really looking forward to the third part. The part is all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor all the time and I found it unnecessarily prolonged. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself, and then is like a little child with every quarrel and leaves?! At the same time, there were also disagreements, of my feeling, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and was trying to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping that this is the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I'm still going to read the fourth part anyway and I hope that it will finally come out that Taylor's friend Sarah is the ex of Volt. That would bring more excitement to the story again.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn to do it! First of all: Sooo bad the movie is not now, as many write. Sure, of course, the story is totally constructed, and always conceived according to the same scheme F. If you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and does not appreciate anything, and does not learn to do it! And that's exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How many times have I just thought about the movie ( and even though I know that it's just a movie, and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, the tears are often already shooting in your eyes. That's why Jurassic World has already made The fallen kingdom really neat. It's just a pity that the person just doesn't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We are consistently destroying animals and the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance ! Empathy for the environment and living beings :misplaced. 4 Stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise there would have been 5 stars in it. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a movie à la 8 Mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and does not want to be. This film is above all "French"- besides, it is calm, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and makes you cry- if you get involved with him and don't expect anything from him that he doesn't want to be at all.
Problematic
Tastes like quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that doesn't matter either. 5 Days a package every morning: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Bloating like never before! After that, diarrhea occurs 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, diarrhea has been going on for 1 week already. It should be noted that only 2 stars were given for the smaller packaging size (unfortunately seen too late), for the larger one a full 5 ? This is very very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint into a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, an approximately maroon (slightly darker) came out. Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfied. This time it was a complete waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like the first time I tried it. What was the worst of all, it still stank weeks after application.. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just did not disappear.
Highly Recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and an even longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating a healthy diet but also by taking vitamins D3 and K2. This also works out in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
The function is not quite perfect !!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with time to "connect" to the mobile phone. This means that it is no longer charging even though you have pressed the "Power On / Off" button for 3 seconds. If you remove the mobile phone from the case and install it again, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinstallation of the mobile phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches from the case by itself, which is why I almost lost it several times. Although these are not many gross defects, I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly, especially in its function, and that's why, for the cost of € 30, I'm very disappointed with the product, especially because I've only been using it for 3 months.
Too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all this good evaluation comes about. In the end, it is actually a spectacle cleaning cloth, which you get a gift in a slightly smaller form at every optician. The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and no better. I have promised myself much more of these cloths it is also really very very thin. Since I have used it, unfortunately I can not exchange it anymore I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far too high more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke down. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I liked shcon in the shower), reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great... Of course, you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it will come off.. he can reproduce sound very loudly... Yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as a bass and is not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loud, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing almost hurt in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are audible just well enough. My old speaker did not reproduce bass well as a bass, but the frequencies were presented quite naturally in the volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. That's why I have to take off a star already. I was expecting more from the frequency response.
very bad
In some places the paint was splintered off and if you just went over it with your hand, the paint went off in some places as well. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want to have them anymore , but unfortunately only at our expense. they would only replace the damaged parts but like if both dresser was damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon has done all this for us and transferred the money back to us. In PRAISE of Amazon
Prefer to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Items are delivered which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no other protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I did not find fault with it, as I urgently needed this product. The supplied adhesive hardly lasts, but sticks neatly for it - like chewing gum which, however, does not become hard. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. The stencils are partially incompletely punched out. Ok for one-time use and as a gag for a party, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high-quality product.
I am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closure + beautiful appearance + stable when it is assembled + Shelf board can be positioned as desired
- Doors pop due to magnets (maybe you can compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean places
- the supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (I didn't have any others and I didn't have a cup in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a little (I wrapped it with some paper and balanced it) Conclusion: if it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give less stars, because you have to make everything suitable to be really satisfied. In addition, I find it a bit too expensive for that.
I like the coffee....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have forgiven 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (individually packed, see photo) also means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full points soon.
Wake me up on the alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud at the same time. I couldn't turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly this is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock, because I thought that it was already morning. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I found the colors and the color change beautiful, unfortunately you can not dim the colored light. I also liked that he has a battery, so that in the event of a power failure, the clock and the alarm time do not have to be re-entered. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Great light, insufficient workmanship
I have replaced four bulbs in the house with these bulbs. Unfortunately, I was only able to replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point... There was also nothing in the box. "6 numbers - get 4" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled this in a friendly and fast way, but I only found out about this after the return deadline. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two stars deduction. The light itself is great. The rooms are now illuminated very brightly and evenly. The light color is more in the direction of cool white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc. For living rooms, I would personally resort to warmer light. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also do this and maybe I will also get intact copies there according to the order. If my review is of any help, I would be happy about a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I have received gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Yes, positively. I have been thinking for a long time whether to order this set or not. ** The material is stable and It Fits Well In The Hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to be able to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on pans with a coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440℉. **They also do not pass on the heat and can be touched directly with it. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swiping and you are gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-Goods Sold as new goods
Amazon Prime shipping is just great. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked.Here we found out that the part has already been installed before. We have noticed significant scratches and abrasions on all mounting parts. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (Unfortunately). Only now we saw that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably been delivered and sent back before. We keep this faucet and install it in the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; we will never order such goods via Amazon again, but prefer to spend a little more at the hardware store where we get decent goods. I just think it's sad that customers are being fooled like that!!!
The product itself is great, unfortunately the outdoor sensor is broken after only 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very simple, and the radio range is also very good, but there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be still intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of the outside air humidity are always displayed. This is a great pity, because the device was mounted on the outside in a protected place and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
A strong mower with a weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery was still going briskly through the republic with Hermes today, without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, the service from Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly at my place and made a valuable impression. The engine is strong and the result is a nice cut. The volume is not impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the big shortcoming is the catch basket. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you only put it down completely for a short time, then of course it will be compressed and parts of the content will fall out. But what is worse is that the actually practical level indicator already shows red when the catch basket is half full. That would not be so bad if the mower did not lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Always emptying the basket on a large lawn when it is only half full may not be the solution now. Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate construction of the catch basket makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The included plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app to protect the battery. For the following reasons, I give only 4 stars. - The soft rear wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite easily. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and put them back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is fully tightened nevertheless, the hotbed is still too high there and the screw almost falls out at the front right, because it is not tightened at all although the hotbed is still too low. The bars that hold the cart are straight, as is the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do there, because it's impossible to print something like that. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free you could only show how you should lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very exhausting. I have already written to support but after a week of waiting I still haven't received an answer. Unfortunately, sending back is no longer possible. I was expecting something more.
robust and precise I am positively surprised
Unfortunately, my old caliper gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be found. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. There are two batteries with it, so that you can start right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but it fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods. I can only give full marks for it and I think it will last at least as long as the old caliper. From mit there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and did not wear it for the time being, as it exudes a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it has been "aired" all the time. After return is no longer possible, I have disposed of it. Discount from the purchase
Ok for the price
The stars and balls on this necklace have gotten a little too big for me personally, so it seems quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which in turn I think is quite nice. However, the chain is very simply processed overall, so I have already torn the closure open twice. So far I have been able to repair it again and again, but I think that this will not go well/last long. But for the low price you simply can not expect anything really high-quality.
Very nice piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can not open, amazing! I rubbed it with a little leather care, this will make it even a little softer and more cuddly. Only: if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, scrap! I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now about the function: connects only after some gimmick.... if you follow the instructions, it does not work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and inserted it again, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about this did not last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three channels was very different! All in all, not to be used like that for me! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase in any case, only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I have had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner shaft was rusted off. I bought them again for one reason only, I urgently needed them because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line and the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production error and the current pump will perform its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic casing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than using only a thin-walled carton. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance.
It could have been thought through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than walking around all the time with a huge bunch of keys. At first everything went quite well. However, the paint came off quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this can also be done with a cent coin, but also only with a cent coin. I have not found a suitable slotted screwdriver that would not have ruined the whole screw right away. To get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: the attachment of the keys. It's nice that you can adjust the screw to different sizes or lengths due to the different parts, but if you have screwed the whole thing together first, you need pliers to disassemble the whole thing again. Attaching the keys themselves is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. In the end, the screw in the thread was broken off the third time I mounted it and the entire thing was unusable. Conclusion: if at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the specified dimensions
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all this in featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to actually evaluate the goods after the first use. In advance, I can already say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment, I can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. If necessary, the really large parts can be put directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, since the round cosmetic bag also contained two smaller bags / sachets. Not of high quality workmanship, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.
So lala
So, ordered before Christmas and worked well until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use him again, he didn't do it anymore. Battery? Swap. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should approach very carefully with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I could not hear an improvement in the sound with my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. There were two black cables with it. Battery life is enough for a very long time. Definitely perfectly adequate sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wearing and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
fancy dress
Very nice dress that is well wearable for a variety of occasions.. Price-performance is fully consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the lightning offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad that I didn't order it smaller (it was recommended). I would have just wished that the neckline was not so deep, and the sleeves could also use a little more fabric (if you don't have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Fingers off. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously did not expect that such a scrap would be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports supply sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD usually works, Blu-rays are detected as unreliable as possible. The discs have to be inserted several times, then Rödel makes noises like you haven't heard from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives since the 90s. After minutes you can then either restart the computer because it will not work anymore or the disc will finally be recognized. But then you should definitely not press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or even anything. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it is supposed to, but is not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually eyewash, because only the port that is facing up is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a stupid extension, I certainly would not have bought this shapeless lump with golden plugs. But apart from the appearance and my miscalculation, the extension fulfills its service very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not just dangle around in the area, as with a normal extension cord. So no real mis-purchase, but my euphoria is kept within tight limits :-).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12, you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I had to send back could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for : P There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case, this does not fit with the adapter. Well, it also keeps so safe and has contact from there... All in all, although a bit expensive, but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and stably manufactured in one aluminum piece. Price performance fits.
Lots of performance
Top device. Has been running for months without problems. Is not exactly light or quiet but brings decent performance. I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather too cool and therefore I am always on the road at level 2. Has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competitive products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head made a very good impression, although the difference in price is very large compared to the original, but it does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the location is felt to be accurate to 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, he likes to jump a few meters, but this is not annoying. I would buy it again anytime. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. He is currently holding out for about 1.5h days. Here would be a great solution which would take 7-14 days. Although there is an XL version, unfortunately it is too big for our taste, the battery would not have to last that long and we also find it impractical to change it every day. You should not deal with the dog with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education classes, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last couple, it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for the lessons. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of crocs broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, no difference seems to be noticeable, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly processed and the retaining strap on the heel is quite loose and very likely will not last five years like my previous ones. I'm curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here yet, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on the off chance that I was lucky. The mattress and a car air pump were included in the scope of delivery. About the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) for a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I have wiped it away and I hope that this one will not appear again. A lying test was carried out directly in the inflated state. It is easy to lie on it and fits perfectly to the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace your own bed, but it is the pure luxury for days at the event. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. Previously, we took out the seats at the back. Thus, it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car. However, the connector was defective (something at the solder joint). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and reassembled the good part worked great and pumped up the mattress in no time at all. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope that she does not lose air and also lasts a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not appear again. After the test, I can definitely recommend you. If I have any other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the lappy processing directly on day 1 over several doors. There were no more doors on the 21st door and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly, because they almost already pleased him. The parts often get mixed up, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to put the parts on. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Mostly the front window. This is also very difficult to reattach.) In itself, I would not buy this calendar anymore and would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe the manufacturers are rethinking the way they have designed the calendar for the next edition and are doing it better. :\
a real drone
I am excited about the drone. My 7 year old daughter is flying with it. Inside it flies very well and the 5 min. Flight time is usually quite enough. I didn't expect anything else at the price that the hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tile or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, nice contact.
Play ok but only playable with compulsion on Steam. When I bought it, I didn't see that it was not a game CD, but just a code with which you can download the game. That would still be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is an impertinence. Since then, the computer hangs up constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery's runtime
I was really looking forward to the clock. Design and look great, messages etc were displayed without any problems. The service worked well.... and yet I send them back. Drr big catch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, located overnight only on drm cabinet and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. If there were a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already at the end at noon / early afternoon and then you can't even read the time anymore. Therefore, not useful for me. It's a pity.
A noble case with restrictions
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+ you should definitely get a case. I recently liked cases in which you can also insert the credit card. This is what the envelope offers here. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. She looks noble. Unlike many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded all around, only there are recesses on the connectors. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible on some QI chargers to be able to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. Even on the QI charging station made of leather from TORRO it is not possible. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well processed!
high-quality case with bulletproof glass film
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put up. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone a little grip. It is not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.
