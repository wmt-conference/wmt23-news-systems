Diego Cocca becomes the new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the USA and Canada, will host the World Cup with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca will succeed Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early exit from the World Cup in Qatar. The 50-year-old was not one of the favorites for the post until a few days ago. He had only taken over as coach of the Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach caused anger at the club.
Geesthacht: New beet signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action “Geesthacht blüht auf” also includes information about what is blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. “Geesthacht blossoms” is an action of Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, day care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been put into the ground since 2015. Objective: Large-scale flowering islands are to be created in the Geesthacht urban area, where insects can find food at all times. “If the weather is favorable, the bees fly out in January to look for food,” says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthacht Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the project does not only remain an action of conservationists and the environmental department of the city, but also extends into the private gardens, explanatory boards are placed repeatedly on the plants. So far, about 50 signs have been erected. Passers-by should be able to find out what is blooming here so beautifully. The hope is that hobby gardeners will replant specifically at home.
The season started at the Wildhasel in the first week of January
More recent are shrubs such as winter-scented hedge cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the buckets on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing just the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been marked with further signs. “The winter scented hedge cherry is a very broad bushy shrub and can grow to between two meters high and three meters wide,” it says among other information about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bed plants that are now showing flowers. The season started at Wildhasel in the first week of January. It blooms particularly lushly on the topping path along the climb, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: “Steppen keeps me young”
Munich - Dance-Gott Fred Astaire would surely be proud of her if he looked down from the sky to Munich’s Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday in the “Mandolin Motion Show Academy” at 3 pm, three ladies meet for a brisk tap dance - together they are unbelievable 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich native (January 15, 1921) from Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is THE highlight of the week. “Dancing and taping is my life, without which I cannot imagine.”
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) are also dancing legs.
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today one would say a musical actress, and worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. “I spent my life dancing, acting and singing.”
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the tap dancer’s circle. She says: “We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl.”
Wikipedia: Tap dance was developed in the United States in the 19th century and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, each more durable than the original wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, dancing creates rhythmic sounds that match the visual impression and the music. The dancer also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeial tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dance, where the tops of the shoes are nailed to create a sound that can be heard while dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at the Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. “We are a big family, with us big and small, old and young are welcome.”
And what is the recipe for such a long life? “I am kept young by exercise”, the 102-year-old told BILD. Her advice to everyone: “Sport, healthy food and no alcohol”.
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital
As digitalization progresses, some people’s appetite for analog is growing again
According to DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick, the speed with which our daily lives went digital meant that we had little time to draw up rules for dealing with it and adapt our methods of communication and working to it.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, you had three choices. You could be one of the lucky six percent who had a private line. Or you could be one of those who had someone from that exclusive group in the neighborhood who could make a phone call to the relative for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you could go to a phone booth. Never forgetting the smell of the plastic phone and the clicking of the coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person’s face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What’s next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also known as Moldova), President Maia Sandu has appointed the former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economist now has 14 days to do so. Until now, Recean has been one of the President’s advisers.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned in surprise. The pro-European leader was under intense pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently hostility from pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her “enormous sacrifice”.
Moldova borders Ukraine and is suffering the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is running at over 40% and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not be a problem.
However, the pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while the pro-Russian ones, with the support of the Kremlin, have become more popular.
These were the costumes of celebrities
2023 will be celebrated again in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities didn’t let themselves be asked for long.
Father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume suggests. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side is wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria’s Minister of Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, has chosen the children’s hero Chase from the Paw Patrol for his costume.
Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and Mrs Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely taken off: Minister of Science and Art, Markus Blume, pulls it into space.
Landtag President Ilse Aigner looked for no less than “Mama Bavaria” as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria’s Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob der Baumeister alias Construction Minister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria’s golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff at Carnival: Bavaria’s Minister of the Interior Joachim Herrmann. At his side is his wife Gerswid.
On the roll: Minister of Economics Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to the craft with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, district councillor of the district of Regensburg, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be absent.
Everything for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the pleasure of the SPD faction leader: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairman Ronja Endres.
Royal became the leader of the FDP faction, Martin Hagen. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he will certainly talk more. In Veitshöchheim, the chairman of the group in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, was out as a mime. At his side is Mrs Andrea.
If politics no longer works, he can at least conjure up magic. Nuremberg’s OB Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermione.
Flying like a bee: Bavaria’s Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of BR, Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR cultural program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side blow against the climate activists by the Franconian crime scene commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the First Mayor of Veitshöchheim was not missing. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Bold eighth in the World Championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Championship titles and continues to catch up with fellow countryman Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even heavy fog did not prevent long-term winner Bö from collecting his second gold at the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway’s mixed relay team was already enough to defend the title successfully.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in the hunting race. Bö is once again the clear favorite in the pursuit. His running form is superb, so he can easily compensate for shooting mistakes to a certain extent.
In the meantime, nothing came together again at Doll. After the routine rider had lost all chances of a medal in the opener with a penalty lap in the mixed relay and only finished sixth, things did not improve three days later. Three penalty rounds already in recumbent shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest member of the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago, he won surprisingly with a margin of 0.7 seconds over Bö. It was one of only three career successes for Dolls, who have been on the podium so far this winter. The eighth-place finisher from Beijing was silent after his poor performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees finished 19th and second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: “We must stand up for democracy”
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, focuses on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
During a visit to Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden insisted on preserving democratic values.
“The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test,” Biden said at the White House in Washington on Friday. “We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the heart of our strength.” Referring to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: “Brazil has isolated itself for four years.”
The left-wing politician Lula defeated Bolsonaro in a runoff in late October. On January 1, Lula took office. The transition of power was accompanied by serious riots. Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court, and the seat of government in the capital, Brasilia, in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is grimly reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently broke into Parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro in the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. “His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening,” Lula said. “Sounds familiar,” Biden replied, an obvious reference to his predecessor, Trump.
Brief note about the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF search posters? They showed the members of the Red Army faction who had been cleared to denounce and shoot down.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, public sentiment was created against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let’s say bourgeois democracy, let’s say late capitalist society. (Here’s nothing about the really dangerous in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which usually goes after Raudis in the S-Bahn or Onanists in the Park, is publishing a new edition with Putin’s friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong, there are perhaps more “Russian friends” than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that’s not the point, it’s: Mrs. Wagenknecht is ranked 1 to 5 (!), followed by Mrs. Schwarzer.
Well, I don’t know anyone around me who reads this paper anymore. If I did, it’s about time. We’ve reached the level we know where there’s nothing below it.
And by now, dialectically speaking, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all those who are not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And there is no need to differentiate here.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler’s lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this to the Bild newspaper and RTL in the same wording. It says: “I can confirm that my client, through his family lawyer, has applied to the competent court for the annulment of his civil partnership. I do not comment on the details.”
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth had been together for 35 years, rumors of separation had been around for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved to Berlin from the house together in the Palatinate, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems in the RTL show.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor killed
A memorial center was established in 1999 in the ruined village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have survived. French President Emmanuel Macron awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hebras fought for freedom and defended France’s values, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had worked for Franco-German youth meetings.
A curve position for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ-Serie Nordlippische Weiler: It is not unusual for three or four generations to live under one roof in Homeien. Here the inhabitants find pure idyll. In the summer 300 motorcycles a day roar the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some of them come right back.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes to be “absolutely” necessary in the fight against high inflation. “Inflationary risks remain high. Energy costs could easily rise again, and the opening-up of China could also provide a temporary boost to prices,” Sewing told the German newspaper “Welt am Sonntag”.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and promised a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on 16 March. The key interest rate in the euro area now stands at 3.0%. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make credit more expensive. This can dampen demand, thus counteracting high inflation rates. Higher borrowing rates can also cause investment to be postponed, thus weakening economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for heavily indebted euro countries such as Italy. “The consequences of persistently high inflation are much more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries,” said Sewing. “Of course we have to keep an eye on this, but a high level of debt must not deter the ECB from acting consistently.”
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area at a rate of inflation of 2 percent over the medium term. This target has been a long way off for months. Although price inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were still 8.5 percent higher than in the same month a year earlier.
Higher inflation reduces the purchasing power of consumers because they can afford less for one euro. Sharply rising energy prices, which drive inflation, are also a burden for businesses.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will “sooner or later collapse,” warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). “I see this as the biggest threat to the German economy at the moment. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario.”
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the “Germany’s pace” declared by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) on infrastructure projects. “There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this, and it may also be a bit more controversial,” he told Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Stuttgart. He hoped that the end result would be a set of rules which would not necessarily have to go as fast as the LNG terminals which were commissioned around the turn of the year - but not as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gas supply gap due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. On the occasion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) spoke of a new “Germany’s pace”. In addition, the Federal Government had recently initiated a speeding-up of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
“First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it comes to it. But this should not automatically mean that from now on we always act so categorically and, for example, put a windmill in a neighbor’s garden against his will,” Hartung said. There must therefore still be a negotiation process as to what society thinks is right and wrong.
In the past, they tried the classic set of rules and failed. “We should reconsider whether the previous approach was the right one. Perhaps we have overdone it with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves.”
In view of the many outstanding tasks, such as the extension of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. “As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the extension and it should be as green as possible.”
Union warns against dismantling of Bayer Group
Following an announced change of boss at Bayer, the chemical trade union IG BCE warns against a break-up of the group. “From the employees’ point of view, Bayer’s three pillars are perfectly positioned for the challenges of the future,” Francesco Grioli, member of the union’s board of directors and Bayer’s supervisory board, told the “Rheinische Post” (Saturday issue).
This includes the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, consumer health with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business. “The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy that is based on risk-spreading and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism.”
The background is the change of chief executive of the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals group announced on Thursday. Controversial chief Werner Baumann will vacate his position this summer. Bill Anderson, the former chief executive of Swiss rival Roche, is due to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been the subject of criticism. The acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for $63 billion, completed in 2018, is a blow to the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had caught up in expensive litigation over alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate. Bayer’s stock had been in the doldrums for years. In 2019, shareholders even refused to approve the CEO’s discharge at the Annual General Meeting.
It has been known for some time that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Long-term strategic investors have exerted pressure. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors, such as Bluebell Capital, have joined in. Bluebell is pushing for a corporate split, according to a media report.
The very small fund with an undisclosed stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off “of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company’s value,” Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told “Rheinische Post”. On the other hand, he does not consider a split-off of the far larger agricultural sector Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands to protest against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are protesting in the streets against a government plan. Hundreds of thousands are planning to demonstrate again against the pension reform on Saturday.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron’s planned pension reform on Saturday. For the fourth time, trade unions are mobilizing against the center-right government’s plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, more than a million people have taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 people took part in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in parliament for a week.
Already, many people in France work longer than they do until they reach the age of 62, if they have not paid long enough for a pay-off pension by the time they reach the age limit. In many demanding jobs, people could hardly work longer, argue opponents of the reform. Employees also wanted to enjoy their well-earned pensions and not to wear out their health completely on the job.
Macron: Looming deficit in pension funds
Macron justifies the reform on the grounds of a looming deficit in the pension fund. As the population ages, workers will have to pay for an increasing number of retirees with their contributions. To keep the pension level stable, the population will have to work a little more. Critics question the government’s calculations and claim that the government must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
However, the government does not only want to tighten the retirement age. The increase in the length of time required for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be speeded up. In addition, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to be raised to around EUR 1200.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron’s most important plans. During the corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, with massive protests and strikes already taking place. Presidents before Macron have pursued reforms of France’s pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were all certain.
Since Macron’s camp no longer has an absolute majority in Parliament, it hopes to push the reform through with the help of the conservative Republicans, who have announced their support. But some lawmakers - even from Macron’s faction - still have reservations. Even greater than fear of a close vote, Macron is likely to worry about crippling strikes at the moment. Before Saturday’s renewed demonstrations, the president said he could count on the organizers’ sense of responsibility to ensure that they were calm and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected - lots of sun in high altitudes
A mighty area of high pressure lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that a lot of sunshine can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. “When looking at the weather maps, a mighty high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye,” explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. “Although this high will shift a little to the east in the course of the next week, it will still determine the weather in Germany.”
However, calm, high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel. “Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands gloomy high fog for days on end, while in the high altitudes of the low mountains there is pure sun.”
Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, there may also be some rain, according to the DWD. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens during the day and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country it remains cloudy or foggy. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees Celsius, in the vicinity of the Rhine around 10 degrees Celsius.
“On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble on the high nebula again and will be able to dissolve it more and more throughout the day,” says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountains and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, the sun is expected all day long, while elsewhere it will have to fight through the high nebula blanket. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine about 11 degrees, on the other hand only about 3 degrees in the perennial grey in the southeast. In addition, there are weak winds from different directions.
On Tuesday, in some lowlands, there may again be only a tough resolution of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather is cheerful after fog dissolution. In highlands, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps, the weather is forecast to be sunny all day. Temperatures rise to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator quarrels: No World Cup medal for Goggia again
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia was very disappointed after her retirement in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
“I’m sad because I didn’t perform as well as I can,” the Italian told ZDF after she set up a goal and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old just avoided what could have been a serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill competitor in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the previous six races in this discipline. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. But Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, will have to wait for a World Cup medal in her parade discipline. She missed her home game in Cortina d’Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
“I actually thought I was good. It was about hundredths of a second,” said Goggia after the surprise victory of Swiss rider Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. “I’m disappointed. I gave everything. But that’s life.” Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected and ultimately missed by all experts: “But they’re not.”
Missing girl in Berlin: Who saw Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since 10 February.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for information on her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the release of a photo, the police in Berlin are asking the public for help in the search for a missing child. Twelve-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school with other children on the way to the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station at around 12:30 on 10 February 2023. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been in Berlin as a refugee since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of German and local language.
Description of person: slim shape

Selenskyy and Minister against Russia’s participation in the Olympics
Kyiv. Sports politicians from 35 nations have stepped up the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by calling for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Paris Olympics.
It was agreed in a joint telephone conference to draft a declaration to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports announced on its website.
“We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues,” said Minister Yurgita Siugzdiniene.
The video consultation took place at the initiative of the UK. It was a very productive meeting, UK Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. “And I have made the UK’s position very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus should not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now make a joint statement on this issue.”
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy protested against the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking officials. “While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions,” Selenskyy said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Ultimately, because of Russia’s aggressive war, even a neutral flag soaked in blood and cannot be worn.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also regards Belarus as a party to the war, because it provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selenskyy called on officials to work to protect Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to the competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which “has unfortunately lost its honesty.”
The occasion of the conference was the announcement by the IOC that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sport, stated that it had also confirmed during the discussions that it would not allow Russian and Belarusian sportsmen to compete in Paris. “In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC’s efforts to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes are the wrong way to go,” said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior in response to dpa’s request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) said at the end of January: “Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum.” Russia, on the other hand, insists that sport and politics must be kept separate.
Russia and Belarus are currently excluded from many international sporting competitions. However, the IOC wants athletes from both countries to return to the international sporting scene under a neutral flag, provided they make a clear commitment to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach recently declared that expulsion “on account of a passport or place of birth” would violate the prohibition of discrimination.
Chalk where it happens
“Hey, horny ass!” whistling after the fool in a skimpy sexy costume and shouting salacious slogans: all of this falls under the term “catcalling.” Behind the term is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of vehicles lost? : US sees Moscow’s tank stock severely depleted
Half of vehicles lost? US sees Moscow’s tank stock severely depleted
The Pentagon estimates that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. This is called “half of the main stock.”
The US Defense Department estimates that the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. “Presumably half of the main stock of tanks” in the Russian army has been “destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine,” said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary for international security at the U.S. Department of Defense.
At an online event organized by the think tank Center for a New American Security, Wallander gave no further details on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to the U.S. estimate.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has promised Kyiv to deliver Challenger 2 battle tanks in March. Germany, in a coalition with other states, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The United States has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, their delivery is expected to take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin leader Dmitry Medvedev promised to build and modernize thousands of tanks. “As we know, our enemy abroad has been begging for planes, missiles, tanks,” said Medvedev, who is now deputy head of the Russian Security Council, during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. “It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of different types of weapons and military technology, including modern tanks.”
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more geared to the needs of the armed forces. This allows individual industries, for example, to be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Fuss about the filling of posts at the Army
The post that Christian Ortner, former director of the Military History Museum (HGM), will hold in the future, was not advertised. Herwig Jedlaucnik, the Academy’s staff representative, suspects corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the course of action.
A call for tenders was not necessary because the appointment was made to a job vacant so far, said the minister. She did not want to comment on “speculations of a freelance employee representative”. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticizing the museum’s handling of Austria’s military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner’s point of view, these have been dispelled.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner’s suitability in terms of content. Ortner is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands information from Tanner about the “unusual ordering procedure”. The decision is due to the “appearance of a poster chess”, says SPÖ defence spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP remains “up to its neck in the corruption swamp”, said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defence. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools kneel at cost
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia’s carnival stronghold of Wasungen wants to stick to the traditional carnival procession. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the estimated total cost of the move.
No carnival parades are cancelled in Brandenburg. The “joyful people’s train” in Cottbus, again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time after the pandemic. No parades have been cancelled at the Swabian-Alemannian carnival either.
In spite of the increased costs, Schleswig-Holstein’s carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade. “We are going through with our event,” says the president of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. But here too the financial worries are pressing: if more sponsors are not found, or if the existing ones donate even more, reserves will have to be tampered with - “this is not possible every year”. The current deficit is around 200,000 euros.
And inflation: there is a price increase of up to 60 percent for confectionery, says Elvira Reuther from the Nuremberg Fastnachtszug Association. Luck in misfortune, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough supply this time. However, it is already certain that the move will become more expensive. Twice as many staff were needed for security as in 2020.
Those on the Rose Monday train in the Rhineland could get fewer camels than in the past. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants don’t have as much with them. Camels or not, the number of visitors is likely to be large: “I believe that if it doesn’t rain from buckets that day, then we can certainly expect an increased number of people,” says the Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. “This is due to the fact that there hasn’t been a regular Rose Monday train for two years. There is nothing to replace the train, of course.”
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. However, the train is generally “deficit”, this is no secret.
The Ukraine Diary: Dreams and Homemade Vodka
The Ukrainians are not regarded as drinking-proof for nothing. There are local beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every time I discover German beer here, not Kulmbacher, but other large-scale breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I do not see much difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely available. They mainly burn it in the villages themselves. They call it samargon. Nobody knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a staggering 80% in five years. Well, here, too, you can see how little one can believe the Russians. It is said that tourists should be careful with this. But that only applies if they go on sale in large numbers. That is probably the case.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards itself for high effort: “Match luck on our side”
Food and drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer after work, you will find great places to do so in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work meetings or pre-lighting for club parties. Where is it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favorite victory and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot “Flocke”
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medals at the World Cup sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to see from the official gallery on Saturday whether the windows at the shooting range had actually fallen. “I had to get the results on my mobile phone,” Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile and referred to the clouds of fog that repeatedly dragged into the stadium, which severely impaired the view on the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nonetheless enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: “Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, biathlon has fascinated me,” he revealed. He also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: “The newly renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. This is also what the athletes say - with thanks to those who have worked here since the World Cup was awarded.” In terms of sustainability, the location is now “one step ahead” of many others and is therefore “safe for the coming years and even decades.”
Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again escaped the competition. Despite a penalty lap after a shooting error, he secured his sixth win in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. Behind him, his faultless shooting brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) completed the Norwegian quadruple victory.
One day after Denise Herrmann-Wick’s triumph, the local ski hunters could not intervene in the battle for the medals. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting error and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished 12th (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the grey veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his botched mixed race on Wednesday, the Black Forest driver dropped five discs this time and disappeared into the cabin as 55th, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö had entered the race with the number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested that status in spite of the difficult visibility conditions. However, in his last two standing shots, he had the luck of a good one; they each landed on the edge of the windows and still fell. The 29-year-old enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year-old brother: “It’s the best feeling to be here with him,” said the world champion: “We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes.”
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In the women’s race, however, Germany’s hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. “If you start with number one, the goal is not to finish tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one,” said sporting director Felix Bitterling. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (13.25 and 15.30 hrs/ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych doesn’t like “swarm of bees” on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on the referee’s ball.
Aggressive players or grumbling coaches? Germany’s referees want to “consistently punish” unsportsmanlike behaviour. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model.
The top German referee Felix Brych has noticed negative tendencies in the interaction on the pitch. “I think there are new behaviors on the part of the players who surround the referee a bit like a swarm of bees after decisions and try to force him into the review area,” the 47-year-old told Deutsche Presse-Agentur. “We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanship. We will pay more attention to this - and we will also sanction it.”
Recently, two coaches had also been dismissed. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. Freiburg coach Christian Streich received yellow red in the league defeat in Dortmund. “The coach’s behavior also falls into the field of unsportsmanship. We have noticed that unsportsmanship has also increased in this area, that the attitude towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsportsmanship consistently,” said Brych.
DFB refereeing chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out that the co-operation between coaches and impartialists was generally good. “Overall, the relationship is right. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned has to live with that. It shouldn’t be anything earth-shattering,” Fröhlich told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
“Emotionality may well lead to conflicts during the game. But if emotionality spills over into personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee,” said Fröhlich. In recent cases, the parties involved have sorted things out afterwards. “It would only be important if a rethinking process were to get underway that such behavior is simply out of place,” said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible repercussions on another level. “Of course, incidents from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently reacted to negative behavior,” said Fröhlich. “Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying discussion with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected is always helpful.”
Combined Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the 10-kilometer cross-country race of Norwegian Jens Lauraas Oftebro ahead of Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third place was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined athletes are not competing in the best line-up in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not among them. They are preparing with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will take place from 21 February to 5 March in Planica, Slovenia. “We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course the team feels that,” said German coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven minor injuries after rear-end crash on A5
Seven people, including two children, were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis). According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist crashed into a car from behind during a slight traffic jam and pushed it onto two other cars. The complete closure of the lanes leading to Heidelberg was lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage in the Marler Sculpture Museum
Created the exhibition: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition ends at the Marler Sculpturenmuseum. There are some extras for the finale.
The closing of the exhibition “Wandgebunden” will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transition quarter of the Marler Sculpturenmuseum at Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. Two large-format murals will attract the attention in three exhibition rooms.
After the exhibition, the walls are painted over and the artworks disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created especially for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the closing ceremony, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art in the service of the community. With the help of numerous illustrations, she presents the peculiarities of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and asks about the connections to this art genre in the Federal Republic of Germany, with a focus on North Rhine-Westphalia from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator and received her doctorate in 2013 on mural painting in the Weimar Republic. Since then she has been researching post-war art as well as art and institutional history in Germany, most recently with Sebastian Freytag on Kunst am Bau in NRW. After the lecture, the final curator’s guided tour of the exhibition will take place. The artists will be on site.
Arrest warrants issued after building collapses in Turkey
It is about structural defects that have contributed to the collapse of buildings: in the earthquake region of Turkey, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after buildings collapsed during the earthquake. Arrest warrants have been issued for 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Saturday, citing criminal prosecution. The defendants are said to be responsible for structural defects that contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Adana is also investigating possible structural defects in collapsed buildings. As part of the investigation, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the accused was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in pre-trial detention, said Anadolu. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
Early Monday morning, a 7.7-magnitude quake shook the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another 7.6-magnitude quake at midday. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
The penultimate Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow dies
Hans Modrow is dead, the Left Group in the Bundestag has announced. The 95-year-old died in the night leading up to Saturday. Group leader Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a “deeply sincere socialist”.
Last night, “Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95,” announced the Left Group in the Bundestag on Saturday. The party thus loses “an important personality,” declared group leader Dietmar Bartsch and former group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he oversaw the end of the GDR. Only four days after the fall of the Berlin Wall, on 13 November 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the Volkskammer elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow took office a month later. He was succeeded as the last Prime Minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
In a message on Twitter, the leader of the Left Group, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow as a “deeply sincere and combative socialist.” Bartsch added:
“Until old age, he was an important counsellor in our party, whose wisdom will be lacking.”
Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary: “The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was a special achievement of his. That will remain his political legacy.”
“His later work in the Volkskammer, the Bundestag, the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of representing that part of the former GDR population who was unwilling and whose interests were regularly violated.”
After reunification, Modrow was a member of the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented the PDS in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa), Modrow had taken a “quite critical” view of the new state. German unification had been accomplished too quickly, the GDR had collapsed too unconditionally, and it had been too unilaterally condemned as an “unlawful state”, according to the dpa, Modrow had criticized in many interviews.
What happened that night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Selenskyy condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine’s energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydropower plants have been damaged, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, head of the energy company Ukrenerho, told Ukrainian television on Friday evening. Electricity supply in the Kharkiv region was particularly bad. Due to the instability of the Ukrainian electricity grid, a reactor unit at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power station had to be shut down, and production at the Rivne and southern Ukrainian nuclear power stations was cut back.
President Volodymyr Selenskyy condemned the Russian attack with some 100 missiles and cruise missiles on Friday as terror. But in a video message he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyy does not want to abandon the small town of Bachmut
February 24 will mark a year of war. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to Poland, a key supporter of Ukraine, just before the anniversary. The threat of Russian missile attacks, however, continued into the night of Saturday. In the capital Kiev late on Friday evening, an air alert was set off for the fifth time for the day. “There is a threat of a drone attack,” the military administration of the Kiev region announced. Iranian-built combat drones were also sighted and shot down over the areas of Mykolaev and Odessa in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the election campaign, among others, by the FDP and the Greens to split them off, were defeated by the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, an agreement was reached on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which in future, however, is to be oriented towards the common good. This means that it does not need to generate and pass on profits.
Recovery backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consultancies are to help the federal government to monitor this process. The backlog of rail network rehabilitation is one of the main reasons why the railways are currently running very late. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem by completing the rehabilitation of entire rail corridors. The investment required for this has so far been estimated at EUR 50 billion. According to recent calculations by the railways, however, they are more likely to be as high as EUR 80 billion.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: “Can someone please pinch me?”
Hermann-Wick did not have a good night’s sleep, she said after the race, was “totally excited” and her pulse didn’t drop as soon as she ran in. “Such a race,” and that at the home World Championships, “you can’t describe it with words,” she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the roaring pop music with German flags, supervisors and team fell into each other’s arms.
“Enjoy biathlon,” that’s what she wanted to do.
The pressure had been particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had entered the World Championships as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hopeful outside of the relay team. Herrmann-Wick was the only German to win two World Cups this winter. She currently occupies fifth place in the overall World Cup. And even if the women’s performance density at the top is much higher than that of the men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, the sprint victory was more likely to be won by others.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-leaning leader. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. Back then, protesters demanding Ortega’s resignation took refuge in churches. More than 350 people died during the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Defense industry demands more orders from special funds
As a result, the first arms projects have already been cancelled, and other projects are threatened with the same thing, as reported by “Welt am Sonntag”. However, it is not yet possible to say exactly which investments would be cancelled. “There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible need for savings already at this point in time”, says the Federal Government in response to a question from Member of the Bundestag Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment amount is rising interest rates. The fully loan-financed Special Assets, which the Bundestag approved in June 2022, has to bear the interest charges for the loans itself. If the interest charges increase, less money is available for the actual purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, current high inflation is reducing the purchasing power of the remaining amount.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
On the night of Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive left at the Kupferzell motorway exit towards Heilbronn onto the motorway. At that time, a 21-year-old female VW driver was driving on the B 19 towards Künzelsau, according to the police. During the turn of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two cars.
Both parties stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed “green” for them. An inspection of the traffic light system did not reveal any complaints. Further investigations will follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW each suffered minor injuries. They had to be taken to hospital. The two cars suffered property damage totalling approximately 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many people in Stuttgart followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake catastrophe in Turkey and Syria. There is a great deal of sympathy - including in Stuttgart.
Earthquake catastrophes in Turkey and Syria preoccupy the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people remembered the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart’s Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had heeded the call of the Feuerbach Ditib Mosque community, young and old, women and men alike. They all listened earnestly and silently to the Imam’s prayer. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah to help the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respect for one another. The community also asked for help and strength to “bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake”.
Ditib stands by the people of Turkey and Syria. Speakers expressed their sympathy for the victims and the families of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration. The prayers were also translated into German in Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. Several million euros have already been raised for the fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in Glockenstraße over several days to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat insert - Ebersberg
“After dinner, you should rest or take a thousand steps”.... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unimagined renaissance. Thanks to the home office, those who are not sitting in the middle of a rocky desert, but rather just a stone’s throw away from the field, forest and meadow, can now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least you could get this impression around Lake Egglburger See, where between 12 and 2 p.m. it’s not just dog owners who hang out.
One reason, of course, could also be that modern humans can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of an optimal use of the time slot. After all, why not learn about the settlement from the long-unseen neighbor on the occasion of a short walk through nature? Or meet the girlfriend you never make it to the cinema with in the evening, not even to the Alte Kino? Also, it was possible to combine work and private life in this way - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? As long as there are no strangers around, of course.
What is more, you can do very well is to buy goods in kind. Fresh fruit, for example, sitting on a table by the side of the road next to cheeses. Or potatoes and meat. It’s a shame if you don’t think about the purchase in advance and make the necessary arrangements. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leave the farmer’s wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voices. “It’s a pity, we’ve forgotten the money.”
The disappointment is palpable, given that you have a companion with a wallet, but you do not have a transport container. This is what you let the sympathetic random acquaintance know. To which the man replies: ’That is not true! You have a bag with you!’ He points to the hood of the jacket, which has been quickly thrown over before leaving the house, even though the sunshine makes an extra headgear unnecessary. “My wife always packs everything in there!”
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat lining and during this midday short excursion you have gained not only the back of lamb, but also a very practical idea. It is quite possible that on that day a second walk is due - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
At around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the county road towards Hailfingen and, for as yet unexplained reasons, veered off the road in a left turn to the right, according to the police report. In doing so, the Audi damaged a guard post, crashed into a tree sideways and stopped a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire brigade rescued him with heavy equipment. The ambulance service took the seriously injured man to hospital. Since it was suspected that he was unfit to drive, a blood sample was ordered. According to the police report, the Audi suffered total damage amounting to 1,000 euros.
Donald Trump’s tax records: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has ruled: the Treasury must turn over the ex-president’s tax returns to Parliament.
Trump 2018, then still in office as President of the United States
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the department’s decision on Friday said.
Contrary to US political custom, Trump, a real-estate entrepreneur, did not disclose his tax returns either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted disclosure all the way to the Supreme Court. A prosecutor’s office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to be made public unless there was a trial.
The disclosure to Congress is arguably more delicate for Trump, where the scope of access is slightly larger, and details could be made public under certain conditions as the committee’s investigation progresses. Moreover, confidentiality from the House keeps leaking out.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the decision as a “victory for the rule of law.” Access to the Republican’s tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. “The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their undermining of our security as President,” Pelosi said.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Life plays out between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which mobile phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either -- or? As slaves of time, they rush today’s people from appointment to appointment and sometimes just push people and hamburgers in between. In her new program, Lucy van Kuhl shows that there is something exciting about the “in-between” state.
In a humorous and thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl narrates and sings about life situations. In her sensitive chansons and crisply pointed cabaret songs, she brings a lot to the point - and there is one or the other between the lines. We start on Saturday, February 18, at 8.30 p.m. in the Club Bastion in Kirchheimer.
British Major Criminal Caught in Thailand After Long Escape
London - After five years on the run, a convicted British drug offender has been apprehended in Thailand. The British National Criminal Investigation Agency (NAC) announced Saturday that the man was arrested by Thai police at a Bangkok auto repair shop on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the NCA’s Most Wanted list of most wanted criminals.
According to authorities, the leader of a criminal group had fled the start of a trial in early 2018 in which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for attempting to import £8 million (€9 million) worth of amphetamines in absentia.

Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The studied physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own admission, loves Viennese humor, is raising a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo “Make Science Great Again” fits this. Whether this fits in well with the prevailing national scientific skepticism here remains to be seen. His humor, in any case, fits very well with Vienna.
By the way, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert’s recent life story, as he tried to find a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York in 2019. But now he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge is and what it can and cannot do. Of course, there is Corona, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many people are putting before them: What’s really important? All of this with a huge wink, unexcited and very ironic. And so we’re not only entertained, but we’re also able to learn something.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle action from the perspective of a tank driver. Battles are fought in a wide valley completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. The valley contains rock pyramids and rock blocks, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super-tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which are increasingly difficult to hit during the extended game. In addition, UFOs appear periodically. These are unable to attack the player-tank. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different operating modes. These are the attraction sequence, the game initiation sequence, the game diagram, the initial entry for maximum results and the self-test sequence. The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the controls and the computer function.
4. Game sequence
The game sequence is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. When the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slow-moving tanks visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the enemy’s tanks or missiles by observing the text displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the cockpit’s cockpit display. For example, a clue might read: ENEMY FROM THE RIGHT. In addition, on the wide-ranging radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound, a point representing the enemy position is visible.
The top, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player’s field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, it is easy to target him on the screen. Furthermore, at the same time, ENEMY IN THE FIRE AREA is displayed on the upper left display.
For a while, UFO’s are visible on the screen flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that observe the battlefield and are unable to eliminate either the enemy or the player’s tank. The UFO’s flying position cannot be detected by radar. UFO’s are intended to complete the battle and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO’s can be eliminated from both the player’s tank and the enemy’s tank. A firing by the player earns him 5,000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are scored: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile, and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and spins twice as fast as the player tank or an opponent’s slow-moving tank. Several options give the setup the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores a bonus tank can be released and for a more difficult game design the appearance of the missile can be varied. Details and the precise switching positions of the game flow selector for this setting are shown in the illustration.
5. Initial input for maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the top scores table, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials into the table at the end of the match. The instructions are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Please note that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or interrupting the mains voltage will delete the table with the maximum results. On RESET, the ten (10) highest scores are received with their initials and are written back on the screen to challenge other players. Each score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol followed by the player’s initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer automatically inserts strokes. After this, the device switches back to the attraction game sequence.
1. New items
The BATTLEZONE unit has five (5) new components. If you have experience with ATARI video equipment, you should be aware of these important differences. The new components are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI gear lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, keeps the control lever in the center position. The micro-switches are now attached with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC Boards. ATARI’S X/Y game circuit has been expanded to include two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the Auxiliary Board. With the help of this switching technique, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and calm image. C. The Power Supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply provided by the extension of the circuit. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin holding capacity. There is also a console in the device that is intended as a pedestal for smaller players to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum stability in the device’s position.
These new components, as well as all other main components of the appliance, are shown in Figure 1. If one of these new components is mentioned in the manual, you will find this marking. 2. Appliance inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should do some checking to complete the quality control. To be sure that the device has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V mains yet. A. Check the outside of the housing for damage. B. Open the equipment service flap and check the components inside the equipment as follows: (1) Check all harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Connect any open or loose connectors.
NOTE: Do not forcibly connect connectors. The connectors are forced to connect correctly. A connector twisted 180 degrees destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the connectors to the game PC board for correct and fixed fit. (3) Note the manufacturing number of the device on the type plate on the rear of the device. Check that the stamped manufacturing number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB, Auxiliary PCB, Controller/Audio II PCB and TV monitor. An illustration of the location of the manufacturing number can be found on the back of this manual. This number should always be given when you call your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, control console and TV monitor for proper installation. (5) Finally, the unit must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. Looking through the player’s viewing glass, check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright orange circled opening of the casing. If the opening is not exactly centered, the casing, which is fastened to the casing with adhesive tape, must be loosened and re-aligned. Before connecting the device to the mains supply, make sure that the voltage selector on the power supply unit 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the connector and check the connection values as listed below:
HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips to help you solve most of the problems associated with current DirectX games. Check System Configuration
Please take the time to verify that your system meets the requirements listed on the package. The DirectX diagnostic program allows you to get an overview of your system if you are unsure that your PC meets the requirements. To access the DirectX diagnostic tool, please proceed as follows: Click the “Start” button and select the “Run” option. In the text box, type “dxdiag”. Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic tool is displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including graphics and sound card information. Among other things, you can check if graphics and sound are working correctly by clicking the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
Other programs may take over the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obvious to be active, and many are automatically started when the system is booted. Such programs, which are constantly active on your system, are also called “background applications”. In some cases, they may be the cause of your program crashing or crashing. Therefore, we recommend that you stop such background applications before starting the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do so, look for the program icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option (“Disable”, “Close”, or similar). - Once you deactivate the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also stop general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. For more information, see the section “How to stop all unnecessary background applications”. Cleaning up the system
Before installing software, it is important to make sure that your hard drive is working optimally. Therefore, you should make a habit of “cleaning up” your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, defragmentation, and disk cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Then there’s a good chance that current games will run largely smoothly on your PC. A “clean” system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, allowing other applications you use to run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to learn about ScanDisk and troubleshooting, defragmentation and disk cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. Click on the “Start” button and select the “Help” option (or “Help and Support”) to access Windows Help. 2. Now click on the search box and enter the appropriate keyword, e.g. “ScanDisk” (Win 98/ME), “Error Check” (Win 2000/XP), “Defragmentation” and “Disc Cleanup”. You will then receive instructions on how to use these tools.
Is the game crashing or hanging?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or crashing. - First, try to download the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
The desire to develop video games was sparked by the advent of 3D, real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a whole host of new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression to push the world to its limits. It was a way for me to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: on the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered, especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be honest, the next 10 years couldn’t satisfy my hunger. I had a dull sense that video games were exploiting only a tiny fraction of their amazing creative potential, because they were too action-oriented and overlooked a fundamental element of the human experience: sensations. In the meantime, technology continued to make rapid advances. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expressing feelings. Although this could, of course, have been done in a completely different way, the greatest merit of Fahrenheit is that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that it is possible to create an interactive gaming experience that is not just based on battling hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting at crates for ammunition, but is far more sophisticated and in-depth. It proves that you can both tell a story and offer content without sacrificing narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both diehard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new experience. If you are more skeptical about video games, I hope Fahrenheit will help change your mind. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has been an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, where we have been forced to challenge many of the principles we previously held to be irrefutable. I would be lucky if Fahrenheit -- much like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you -- didn’t pass you by without a trace either. David Cage

Transport damage
Insofar as external transport damage is recognizable, these must be immediately denounced, recorded on a transport note and confirmed by the supplier (freight forwarder, federal railway, etc.). The manufacturer is not liable for transport damage!
The unit is set for the mains voltage indicated on the type plate. For other mains voltages, the unit transformer and the monitor transformer must be switched. According to VDE regulations, the unit is equipped with a protective conductor connection and is only intended for dry rooms. Impeccable operation of the coinage requires horizontal and perpendicular positioning of the device. SERVICE TIPS
IMPORTANT! If at any time an incomprehensible display appears on the monitor, please turn the machine off briefly (pull the power plug) and on again. If the device does not work properly afterwards, a repair is necessary.
Pull power plugs before repairing! During monitoring and testing: Do not touch voltage-bearing parts! Even when the device is switched off, the monitor can still carry dangerous voltage. WARNING, HIGH VOLTAGE! At the anode connection of the image tube are approximately 20000 volts. Replace fuses only with those with the same values! A blown fuse signals overload of a component. If the fuse is replaced by a higher quality fuse, serious damage may be caused. Replace components only with original spare parts. Never remove printed circuits/connections when the device is switched on. SERVICE MANUAL QIX
Game sequence
By pressing the appropriate start button, the game starts for one player or (with minimum credit 2) for two players. Try to get a lot of space without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game sequence is set in such a way that a minimum area must be covered before the next area (round) can be tackled. At the top of the screen, the time-controlled SPARXs are displayed by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARXs are released. On alert, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, while you’re trying to map your area, your marker goes into a death spiral, it will be destroyed because you can’t cross or return your own path. If you hesitate and don’t complete your area, a fuse will be plugged and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. At slow drawing speed, the points are doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to test itself, provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working correctly. For more information, see “Service Program”. The volume can be controlled at the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

It is possible to install a coin counter in the device. One line to 412 V DC supply. One line to J 15 - 13 on the ROM/IC board.
SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing the 4 switches, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video-PC board are used.
Programming indicator. This indicator selects the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The “sub-test” button can be used to set the languages. When the desired language - green - appears, press the “test” button to switch to the next program display. Bet programming. This display can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. It can also be used to set a “maximum number of credits” that may be before the game starts. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the “Sub-Test” button (appears green), the desired value for this line is programmed with the “Up” or “Down” button. By pressing the “sub-test” button several times, the factory or basic setting can be reached if the bottom line (RESET line) lights up green, press the “Up” button. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. “Test” always triggers the next program display. “Back” [Reserve High Score value x 10 000] is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display up to “High hit rate so far”. This value determines the required number of points/hits a player needs to enter their own initials (names) and hit points on the screen. The “Maximum Credit” determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. If the limit is exceeded, if there is a coin lock, coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 to 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin, credits cannot be zeroed if more than 99 is added. A free spin mode can be selected by setting “Maximum credits” to O. Other programming options: “Number of games”: Number of markers per credit
“Threshold”: Amount of % number to be reached in order to switch to the next pass
“Time limit”: allowance for additional savings
“Difficulty”: Difficulty of the game
“Tone of attraction”: at “0” no sound when stationary
at “1” sound also when stationary (animated sound) “table model”: at “0” stationary
for “1” table-top machine
Credits per coin are set on the “Slot Programming” indicator. High-Score Program indicator (highest hit rate so far). The player’s hit points and initials, including the next 10 scores, appear. The values are used to adjust to the highscore selected on the previous display (set from “back”). By pressing the “Up” button, the initials QIX Standard are set. By pressing the “Test” button, the next program display appears. The “Overall Evaluation”. By pressing the “Up” button, you can set it to 0. The following values are recorded: Total Credit: The number of credits paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts again. The total number can only be 0 when the battery or plug-in W1 is removed with the device switched off. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Credits Paid: Number of credits given for homemade (converted coins). Credits Granted: Number of credits given by the device. % Free Spins: Credits Granted (Paid + Credits Granted per 100) Minutes Played: Number of minutes played. Minutes won: Number of minutes, extended or won. % Leisure: Minutes won/minutes played per 100. Average playing time in seconds: Minutes played/minutes paid + credits granted
High Score: The number where a player had enough high score to push other players out of the high score list. Pressing the “Up” button sets the values to 0. Pressing the “Test” button brings up the next program display.
Insertion slot programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, the display can select a default coin setting or program another setting.
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the “Up” and “Down” buttons while the top digit on the screen is green. The values change as the digit changes. If the correct setting is reached by pressing the “Test” button, the setting is applied. If a setting that does not correspond to the default setting is desired, the values can be adjusted by pressing the “sub-test” button. After a single press, the upper setting is set to 0, which means that you can set your own setting. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that is close to his desired values and only changing the values that do not match. Once the setting has been made, any reset value can be selected by pressing the “sub-test” button. The default setting appears when pressed unintentionally. The “Up” and “Down” switches can be used to increase or decrease the values. Pressing the “Test” switch terminates the process. The coin multiplier (“coin unit”) tells how many coin units are given for each coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin units - “credit” shows the number of units required before a credit is issued. “bonus” coin units shows the units required before a bonus credit is issued. “mini coin” is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, “0” is not used. CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If “Memory Failure - Service Required” appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which dom all programming is stored, is down. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This state probably indicates battery failure or failure.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS
Start of the test method. Press the “Sub-Test” button or the “Self-Test” button (SW 1 near the LED indicator). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the “Test” button the next program will be displayed. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in auto-test mode. In this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. If the display “Open Coin Door to Test” appears, the program connector J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. If the connector J 19 is removed, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off = on = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is incorrect, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be inserted as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROMs. The E-PROM type for each series is selected via the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing pre-determined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking if the memory was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the gossip stops with the above display, an error has been discovered. If the communications-RAMs fail during the video-board test, the fault may have been caused by a defective wiring (RAM) or a fault in the data-board. To locate the fault, remove the data-board from P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means: fault in U 3, U 4 or connected circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After entering values into another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the connected circuits or the decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers are followed and checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, connected multiplexers and decoders.
Video Board (Display RAM). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these inscriptions are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LEDs show the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LEDs), the next test will be started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately, disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. That’s also the reason for star number one. The second reason that the right jacket arrived without any obvious seam defects. BUT I was probably too excited for this jacket, because the disappointment was even greater. I was guided by the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it is supposed to sit so tight and I didn’t want to fight into an S or M with my upper width.... In the end, it would have fit in the length and at the waist... in the rest I could swim. Besides, the feed material came to meet me when opening the parcel and spread all over the place. It’s just a pity.. It’s being sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket looks great. We were surprised at how good it was. It’s good to wear from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, and she’s really excited. She’s usually wearing the 158, and she fits the 36 pretty nicely in this case, and I’m sure she’ll be wearing it next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack, and it’s not optimal. Unfortunately, I measured myself, and the pad doesn’t fit exactly. Which is my mistake. I then slightly modified something to make it fit. The pad looks very robust, and you don’t damage the edges anymore. You can use the nut or you can use the whole surface. It worked without any problems. It doesn’t slip anymore. I would buy it right away.
Too big for under 1 year
The product itself I’m okay, but not under one year. Because the area to chew is much too big for the small mouth. We brought it when our son was 7 months old and he couldn’t use it because of the size. Now at 12 months old we’ve looked for him again and he can use it. Has not yet been able to bite with his already few teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it calms him down a lot.
Quality insufficient / Regrettably goes back
I have been dazzled by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I would like to point out that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a rather small one for the most important everyday things you take with you. Due to the fact that I have just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro is now finally too small and I need a replacement. On Prime Day, I bought this backpack for a really affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about the purchase, as I had read many of the reviews beforehand. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the disillusionment ensued: the backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can’t say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products that are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, that’s just not true! I really hoped it would be, but that’s not the case. The upholstered walls are much thinner and do not offer as much protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the partitions inside are of a different caliber, much more labby. Overall, the feel of this backpack is not comparable to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not very good either. That is why I have decided that the backpack should go back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, I am afraid I have to pick up the money for a decent backpack. It seems that quality comes at a price here. For someone who doesn’t want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is a good choice, but it’s not for me. And it’s not like I had a hard choice to make. When I unpacked the backpack, two minutes later I knew it was going back. What I really liked was the color on the inside. I’m sure you can find your stuff a lot quicker than if you have a gray interior. For someone who has different demands on a backpack, the backpack is probably a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far I had liked the Electric series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and was really looking forward to the third part. The part is all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor all the time and I found it unnecessarily prolonged. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admits everything and is like a little child in every fight and gets away?! At the same time, there were also inconsistencies, I feel, because at the end of the second part, Volt was still trying to convince Taylor’s ex and didn’t believe him when he said Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn’t do it without him and that he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is fighting for Taylor. I was hoping this would be the last part of the series and I think this part is the weakest part and also quite unnecessary at the same time. I’m going to read the fourth part anyway and I hope it finally turns out that Taylor’s girlfriend Sarah is Volt’s ex. That would bring more suspense to the story.
Man destroys everything, doesn’t appreciate anything and doesn’t learn to do it. First of all, the movie isn’t that bad now as many people say. Of course, the story is totally constructed, and it’s conceived in the same F-scheme over and over again. Once you’ve seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and appreciates nothing, and doesn’t learn to do it! And that’s exactly what the movie wants to tell us! How many times did I think about the movie (even though I know it’s just a movie and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, they often make you tear in your eyes. That’s why Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is already made really neat. It’s just a pity that people just don’t get the message behind the movie, even though it’s a mainstream movie. We are consistently destroying animals and the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and greed and stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living things :Miss. Four stars, because the movie is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise there would have been five stars in it. Still, well made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some people expect a movie à la 8 Mile. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and it doesn’t want to be. This movie is above all “French” - it’s also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and don’t expect anything from it that it doesn’t want to be.
Problematic
Taste like quench from the 90s, of orange, but that doesn’t matter. 5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, but nothing at all. My abdomen has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, in spite of immediate discontinuation the diarrhea remains for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller package size only 2 stars (unfortunately only seen too late) were given, with the larger full 5 ? That is very very strange!
awful smell and poor result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint to a chocolate brown, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I used the product twice. The first time I used it, I immediately noticed that it smells awful! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out about a chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I didn’t get my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions, even if I didn’t get a satisfactory result. This time it was a waste of time! It didn’t make any difference, my hair looked like it did the first time. Worst of all, it still smelled weeks after the application. No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn’t go away.
Highly recommended
I have been taking the tablets for a long time now and always take one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for some time now because of my work, not enough exercise and a prolonged additional illness. I wanted to boost my immune system not only by eating healthy foods, but also by taking vitamins D3 and K2. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not perfect !!! After 3 months of use of the battery case I discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems to “connect” with the mobile phone. This means that it is no longer charged even though you pressed the “Power On” button for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and installing it again will solve the problem in 70% of cases, but it will create a new deficiency. 2) Due to frequent removal and re-installation of the phone in the case, the cover is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times already. Although these are not many gross defects, I think that a case with battery should work perfectly in its function and therefore, for the cost of 30€, I am very disappointed with the product, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don’t know how all these good reviews come about. After all, it’s actually a glasses cleaning towel, which you get from every optician in a slightly smaller form. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I promised myself much more of these cloths it is also really very thin. Since I used it I can not exchange it anymore I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far too much more than 2 euros you should not give.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a freebie, got broken. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (I fell shcon in the shower), gives bass as well as bass, Bluetooth works great... You have to irrigate the suction cup, of course, otherwise it will come loose... it can play sound very loud... yeah... what I’m critical of is the frequency response of this little speaker. As I said, bass is played back as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, that causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of singing almost hurt your ears, higher and lower frequencies are just enough audible. My old loudspeaker didn’t reproduce bass as well as bass, but the frequencies were displayed quite naturally in the volume. Unfortunately, that’s not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. So I have to take a star off. I expected more from the frequency response.
very bad
In a few places the color was chipped off and if you just went over with the hand the color went the same in some places. We wanted to let them pick up for free because we no longer wanted them, but unfortunately only at our expense. They would exchange only the damaged parts but as if both dresser was damaged. Bad service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and sent us the money back. KUDOS to Amazon
Better spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is reflected in the quality. It comes with individual parts that you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which is made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox some stencils were damaged. I didn’t blame it, because I needed this product urgently. The adhesive provided hardly lasts, but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which doesn’t get hard. Already one day after gluing almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to stick everything together. The stencils are partially punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and go for a high-quality product.
I’m not dissatisfied. The cupboard looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + magnetic lock + nice look + stable when it is set up + shelf can be positioned arbitrarily
- Doors pop by magnets (maybe you can compensate with rubber knobs) - some dirty places
- the included dowels are much too small and wobbly (did not have any other and did not have a cup in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobbly a bit (wrapped it with some paper and balanced it) Conclusion: If it didn’t look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Besides, I find it a little too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me .... but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect I would have given 5*. Unfortunately the coffee doesn’t run evenly (if at all!). Also the extra plastic waste (separately packaged see photo) means a star deduction for me. I hope the manufacturer will change this and collect full points soon.
Gets on my alarm clock
The alarm came quickly, and everything is easy to set up. But the natural sounds sound terrible, and they’re very loud. I couldn’t turn them down either. Probably a defect, supposedly possible. The quietest radio setting was too loud for me, and I immediately fell out of bed. On top of that, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hand. I used to wake up when I turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was tomorrow. But when it happened, and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and also the color change, unfortunately you can’t dim the colored light. I also liked the fact that it has a battery so you don’t have to re-enter the clock and the wake-up time in case of a power failure. But went back for the reasons mentioned.
Light great, workmanship insufficient
I replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without sockets - instead, a circuit board is laughing at me here ... There was nothing in the box either. “Pay 6 - get 4” is not a good deal. I’m sure Amazon would have dealt with this quickly and compassionately, but I didn’t find out until after the return deadline. So I see this as my mistake and live with it. Still, it’s not a good indication of the quality of these lamps - so far the only reason for a two-star rating. The light itself is great. The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated. The light color is more toward cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc. For living rooms I would personally resort to warmer light. Compared to a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also do that and possibly I can also get intact copies according to the order. If my review is helpful, I am happy about a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great
I’ve received gestures and I’d like to share my first look. Yes, positive. I’ve been thinking a lot about whether to order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang them ** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially convenient to use on pans with coating. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. **They don’t pass on the heat either, so you can touch them directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after wiping, they’re gone. Finally, I have to say that I’m very surprised and I can only recommend
B-goods Sold as virgin
Amazon Prime Shipping easy tip. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked. Here we found that the part has already been installed. On all assembly parts we found significant scratches, abrasions. The fittings/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the wash basin (Unfortunately). Only now we saw that also on the chrome-plated faucet itself there are scratches / streaks. This part was probably delivered before and sent back again. We keep this faucet and install it in the basement sink because it doesn’t matter how it looks. Our conclusion; Never again we order such goods via Amazon but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we get ordinary goods. Just find it sad that customers are so fucked up!!!
Product in itself top, external sensor unfortunately already broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is very good, but there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can be mounted either on the wall or like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use the device measuring the values on the outside seems to be broken. However, the thermometer seems to be still intact, here still plausible values are displayed. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably dead, because it always displays completely astronomical values of the outside air humidity. That’s a pity, because the device has been installed on the outside in a protected place, and it’s also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery Stand is still happily driving Hermes around the Republic today without finding a way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon’s service of triggering a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression. The engine is powerful, and the result is a nice cross-section. The volume is not very low, but okay. The big drawback is the catch basket. For one thing, it’s made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and made of fabric in between. If you put it down just briefly, of course, it’s compressed, and some of the contents fall out. What is worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator shows red when the basket is half full. This would not be so bad if the mower didn’t lose large parts of the cut material from then on. Emptying the basket when it’s half full on a large lawn is not the solution. So I cleaned the mower as well as I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but due to the unfortunate construction of the catch basket it becomes unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate through the app. Very good is the plug-in sensor cable that comes with it, which can be extended if you need to. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to protect the battery only once or three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed with some fiddling. - One of the two devices is in a room with pretty thick walls. This device loses its connection to the network every one or two weeks. Unfortunately, the device doesn’t reconnect on its own, even if you put it close to the router. You have to take the batteries out, put them back in after a short break, and then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There’s always an alarm if the connection is lost. The alarm tone might be a little louder.
3D printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed properly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high and the front right the screw falls out, because it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The bars that hold the car are straight as well as the table too. Maybe someone knows what to do, because it’s impossible to print anything. About the setup: The setup was quite easy you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very strenuous. I have already written to support, but after a week of waiting, I still have not received an answer. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send back. I had expected something more.
robust and precise am positively surprised
My old gauge, unfortunately, gave up after many years, so I had to get a new one. This one looks very robust, and it’s just as accurate after several test measurements. It comes with two batteries, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the gauge is simple, but it really serves its purpose. Otherwise, the valve leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full points for it and believe it lasts at least as long as the old valve. There is a clear purchase recommendation from mit and a good measuring instrument belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent smell
I bought the bracelet and didn’t wear it for the time being because it had a disgusting smell. To this day, the smell has not gone away, although it has been constantly “ventilated”. When it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. Rate from Purchase
For the price ok
The stars and balls on this necklace are a little too big for me, so it looks quite massive. The larger balls are freely movable, which I like again very nice. However, the necklace is very easy to work with, so I have already cracked the clasp twice. So far, I’ve been able to repair it again and again, but I don’t think it’s going to last long. But you can’t expect anything really high-quality for the cheap price.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can’t open, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, that makes it even softer and smoother. But if you have something magnetic on your arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately, scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connect only after some gimmicks.... if you follow the instructions it doesn’t work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about it didn’t last long, because already after an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the transmitters were located next to the base station. Also the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, there was no use for me! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase anyway, it only brings trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner shaft had rusted off. I only bought it again for one reason, I needed it urgently due to the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction pipe and the drain would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will last a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport defect, the plastic casing was cracked and the ventilation vents were broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a bit better than just using a thin-walled carton. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic casing did not affect the pumping performance.
You could have thought it through better. Since I deal with a lot of different keys, I thought an organizer like this would be more comfortable than walking around with a huge set of keys all the time. Initially, everything went pretty well. But then the paint came off pretty quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It’s nice that you can do this with a penny coin, but only with a penny coin. I couldn’t find a suitable screwdriver that wouldn’t have ruined the whole screw right away. Now to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can set the screw to different sizes or lengths by the different parts, but if you have screwed the whole thing first, you need pliers to pull the whole thing apart again. Attaching the keys to itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. Finally, the third time I mounted the screw in the thread broke off and the whole thing was unusable. Conclusion: If at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not fully correspond to the stated dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material looks sturdy and all this in feather weight. Since I don’t have a comparison (my first organizer set), I will only be able to judge the goods after the first use. I can say in advance that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment, I can’t really imagine packing everything there, e.g. for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really big pieces can be put directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8 pieces were delivered, but 10 pieces, because in the round cosmetic bag there were two smaller bags/bags. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags doesn’t bother me personally. I regard the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that’s ok.
So lala
So, ordered before Christmas and worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn’t. Battery? Swapped. But it still doesn’t work. So I could have thrown the money right in the trash can.
Maintenance is always good! It is easy to use, but you should be very careful with the brush to avoid damaging the needle. I couldn’t hear an improvement in the sound of my very high quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. With them were two black cables. The battery life is long enough. Definitely sound enough. I liked that the headphones don’t hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. Also the weight is kept very low. Recommended purchase in this price range.
Fancy dress
Very nice dress, which is well wearable for different occasions.. Price-performance agrees completely here, especially since I also bought it in the lightning offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I’m glad I didn’t order it smaller (it was recommended). I just wish the neckline wasn’t so deep, and the sleeves could take a little more fabric (if you don’t have as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
It doesn’t get any worse. I really, seriously didn’t expect this kind of junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. The USB ports are supposed to provide enough power. However, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD works normally, Blu-rays are detected at most unreliable. The discs have to be inserted several times, after that it makes noises like you have heard from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives since the 90’s. After a few minutes you can either restart the computer because it doesn’t work anymore or the disc is finally recognized. But then you must never press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything else. This immediately leads to an irreversible freeze. In addition, of course, there is no Blu-ray software included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
It does what it’s supposed to do, but it’s not pretty. First of all, I want to point out that the two USB ports are actually eye-catching, because only the port that faces up is a USB port. The other connector is only there to charge any device, so it’s relatively useless. I didn’t know that when I bought it, so I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port, and if I only needed a nasty extension, I certainly wouldn’t have bought this misshapen lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the plugged-in USB-Stick doesn’t just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So not a real bad purchase, but my euphoria stays within tight limits :-).
Small but oh! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also move data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I had to send back already couldn’t. Practical is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and that of the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation for :P There was a small adapter which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case it doesn’t fit with the adapter. Well it also holds so secure and has contact from there... All in all a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. Also very small the whole thing and made in an aluminum piece sturdy. Price performance fits.
Lots of power
Top device. Has been running for months without any problems. Not exactly light or quiet but has a lot of power. I find the middle setting of the temperature (Tp setting) a bit too cool and am therefore always on stage 2. Has also fallen on the tile floor several times and survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competing products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The workmanship of the brush head made a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We have the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode the location is felt to be 0.5m accurate. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters which is not disturbing. I would buy him again any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently he lasts about 1.5h days. Here would be a great solution which would manage 7-14 days. There is an XL version but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, as long as the battery doesn’t have to last and we find it impractical to change it every day. You should deal with the dog not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem to be comfortable. However, the lifespan is decreasing. Even though my son only wears the shoes for physical education, after only a few weeks the sole breaks and the shoes cannot be used anymore. The last pair of shoes in normal use did not last very long, but I thought it would be enough for class. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? Unfortunately, my last pair of Crocs broke down after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, at first glance, these are poorly made. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance there seems to be no difference, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the strap on the heel is quite loose and very probably won’t last five years like my previous ones. I’m curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them on good luck. In the scope of delivery were the mattress and a car air pump included. Regarding the mattress: I put it in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there was some mold on one side. I wiped it away and hope that it doesn’t reappear again. In the pumped-up condition a lie test was carried out directly. It fits nicely on it, and it’s a great fit for the festival. Of course, this mattress can’t replace your own bed, but it’s a luxury for days at the event. It fits nicely in my car. Before, we took out the back seats. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress needs two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car. However, the plug was broken (somewhat at the soldering point). Since my friend is skilled in craftsmanship, he was able to repair it and reassembled the good part worked brilliantly and pumped up the mattress in zero comma nothing. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I am looking forward to the endurance test at the festival. I hope it doesn’t lose air and last a long time. I also hope it doesn’t turn up mold again. After the test, I can definitely recommend it. If I have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar gets only two stars from me. :( 1. For the fast shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is ripped open by several doors on day 1. On the 21st door, there were no doors left and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts because they were already coming to his liking. The parts often come out messed up which often means that you have to disassemble the car in order to put the parts in place. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. (Most of all, the windscreen. It is also very difficult to reinstall.) As such, I would not buy this calendar anymore, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Maybe the manufacturers will rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and make it better. :\
a real drone
I’m really excited about the drone. My seven-year-old daughter flies with it. Inside, it flies really well, and five minutes of flying time is usually enough. I expected that hair would get stuck in it and that the drone would break down very quickly, given the price, but falling from the ceiling to the floor, whether it be tiles or carpets, is not a problem. Nice contact if you have any questions.
Game ok but only playable by force to Steam. Didn’t see when I bought it that it’s not a game CD but just a code to download the game. That would be fine so far, but you’re forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, the computer has been hanging up all the time, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the runtime of the battery
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and look great, messages etc were displayed without problems. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. The big hitch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, overnight only on drm cabinet and in the morning 11% less battery when not used. When a lot of news came in the day, the battery was already out at noon / early afternoon and then you can no longer even read the time. So for, me not usable. Very bad.
Noble sleeve with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, it’s really important to get a sleeve. The last thing I liked was a sleeve that you can also put your credit card in. This is the sleeve here. If you put your cards in all three compartments, it’s too much, so the lid is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather case looks sturdy and looks good. It looks classy. Unlike many other cases, the phone is embedded all around, only the ports have recesses. Otherwise, you can operate the on-off switch and the volume control on the sides well through the case. The disadvantage is that on some QI chargers it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. Even on the leather QI charging station from TORRO it is not possible. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well made!
high-quality cover with armored glass foil
Sturdy case with a real armored glass to protect the screen in a classic design provides all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11. Fits very well and can be easily put on. The material is comfortable to use and does not dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some footing. It’s not too bulky and it’s firmly attached to the phone. Overall, a good buy.
