In the Shadow of Extinction: Three Breeders' Puppies Born in Iran
The world's fastest animal is being hunted to extinction, and is the victim of droughts and deadly road accidents across the Islamic Republic.
As a result, fewer than 20 bridles were left.
Three Asian birdbaths were recently born in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This rare birth only slightly improves the tragic plight of the animal, which is endangered in the country due to droughts, poaching and fatal road accidents.
This is the first birth of the Bredles in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where the bradle is still alive in the wild.
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported that the veterinary staff of the Turhan National Park Trust in the northern province of Samnan decided on a captive cesarean delivery.
It was also noted that there were fewer than 20 brothels recently recorded in seven different counties in the state.
In the face of their extinction, the UN implemented a protection program for them back in 2001.
Now, in Iran, it is hoped that the new cubs will be able to bring about a future growth in the burdock population.
In January, Iran's deputy environment minister, Hassan Akbari, said the country's bird population had declined dramatically from 100 birds in 2010 to just 12.
"Their situation is extremely serious", said Achaberi, noting that the birds have been victims of drought in their habitat, hunting, and even road accidents.
The birdie is considered the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching speeds of up to 60 miles per hour.
The bird can be found in various places around the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car.
Slowly, slowly, Spotify started to try its luck in the hardware world as well.
After years of development, Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the United States.
We got our hands on the first machine in Israel.
The vision: make your old cars smart
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and it was built specifically to provide a solution for people who own old cars.
A few weeks ago, I got a first opportunity to try out this new product, which is currently only available to single moms in the United States, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was extraordinary, as our home car broke down and we had to drive for a few days with a replacement car with an old system.
After two weeks of fun, I realized how easily the car thing could become an integral part of many people's systems.
And on the other hand, with the long waiting list and the uncertainty about a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.
From Concept to Reality
Sometime in 2018, Spotify users started getting an interesting offer in their email inbox -- the possibility of purchasing a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which would turn any old system into a smart car.
Rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company was planning to soon introduce a new product for a car's smart radio modem with 'global connectivity'.
A few months later, these rumors made headlines again after the music service updated with the car's status -- the one we now know from the app -- activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the car's system.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled last April the Car Thing, its smart system for vehicles.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays in shipping.
So of course, right after the press conference that was held, I went to the website and I signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited message arrived.
Logging back in will buy me the device with a little surprise - it won't cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First of all, the Spotify device impressed me very much with its build quality.
And it's a little bit smaller than my iPhone 11 and it includes a larger, brighter, sharper touchscreen on the front than I expected.
Also, you'll find a round button next to the screen and a circle that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the huge circle, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer if the company would allow me to change the circuit function so that I can control the volume of my smartphone, since I can also navigate using the touch screen.
Maybe that'll be possible in a future release.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes a USB Type-C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you may remember how in the past we used to turn off our radios and hide them in the drawer after we got out of the car.
The Car Thing certainly brings that feeling back with its construction.
All the adapters were attached to the body of the device by a very strong magnet, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
In addition, along the entire top of the device you can find small buttons that can be easily set to trigger different playlists or podcasts.
By long-pressing one of the buttons while playing, or by asking the voice assistant, I've set up some of the playlists I hear most often and the radio show I listen to every morning on the road.
In doing so, Fitcher made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From an old car to a smart car
After a fairly simple physical installation, I connected the Car Thing to the power.
I was pleasantly surprised by the process of the definition.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than five minutes, and a few moments later I was on the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through a glutinous and controls the app like a controller, so it can copy all the information on our account from it.
So you'll still have to connect your smartphone to the car, either through a Bluetooth or an AUX cable to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, as like the app on a smartphone, it puts emphasis on the album photos and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations to suit your taste, the search screen and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between different screens using the touch screen or using the manual dial.
What's more, you can call the device's voice assistant at any time by saying "Hey Spotify".
With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
In my experience, she recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was blowing directly into the instrument.
That's probably because of the four microphones that are installed on the top of it.
It's important to note that right now the voice assistant doesn't support Hebrew, and at the time of this article's publication, there's no information on when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for?
My experience with the device has been great, and it's a positive surprise to me considering that it's still in the early stages of release.
Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
However, there is occasionally a slight hiccup in the interface, but I believe that Spotify will address such bugs with future updates.
Obviously, the Swedish company has been working on it a lot in the last few years, and of the various versions that have leaked online during this time, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to target.
After all, his activity is limited to controlling the app on his smartphone, and not much beyond that.
What's different than buying a car seat for a few bucks and plugging it in so that your smartphone is closer to you while you're driving?
This question gets even more powerful when you consider that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify, and will often buy you a lot more functionality.
Still, the more I used Car Thing, the more I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
The ability to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one that I've come to appreciate in the last couple of weeks.
One question remains -- will Spotify ever release the device to the general public?
And if so, will it be established here in our little country?
Swedish society doesn't tell much right now.
She didn't even share how many subscriptions to the device she's currently running around the world, and how many she plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is that the price is expected to be $79.
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides a first glimpse into a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel reported that there is no information at this time about a plan to launch the device in the country
I know.
You recruited talent for the company?
That way you can make sure the competition doesn't "kidnap" it from you.
The economy is still in a labour market dominated by workers, and this is especially true for the most desirable workers - the talented.
Here are some tips to help you keep it in your workplace
I know.
Despite the increase in the past month, Israel's unemployment rate remains one of the lowest in the world, and in the top ten of OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the ILO).
That is, the economy is still in a labor market dominated by workers and that is true seven times over for the most desirable workers  talents.
As for those professionals and managers who are the focus of knowledge, experience and proven ability, trends in the labour market show that competition for them, the talents as they are called by employers, is still in full force.
What this means for employers is that in the current labor market, they don't have the luxury of resting on the sidelines even a minute after a talent is hired, because as soon as he walks through the company's doors, another company will already be trying to snatch him up.
That is, the competition for talent is so intense that many even after being hired continue to be denied tempting job offers, with 30% of employees actually leaving within a month of being hired and starting work.
That's why smart employers will immediately move from recruiting talent to retaining it, starting first and foremost with pre-planning and being creative in the hiring process.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful recruitment process will make a talent excited about their new workplace from day one and even look forward to the future.
Here are some tips on how to set up and run a proper recruitment process that will help retain new talent:
It's not a secret -- sharing and organizing.
Share with the people who will be working with him on his recruitment, explain why he's vital and important to the company and the role, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives where he is expected and understands his value will feel wanted and will strive to prove his expectations.
Knowledge is power -- alignment of expectations.
They had a talent-coordination call on day one.
Get to know his professional background and find out where he sees himself in the future, so you can show him the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him to get there.
We're all people. We're all personal acquaintances.
During the recording days, we tried to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and were interested in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who is interested and allowed to exercise and express himself beyond the confines of his job will appreciate that and want to keep it that way.
Curiosity is a pre-requisite.
Already in the intake phase, you can create an attraction that makes the talent want to fit in quickly.
And do it not just with talk of bonuses and benefits, but by exposing him to an exciting field or an interesting technology, because that kind of stimulation to creativity leads to curiosity and increased interest in the workplace.
Also, encourage the talent to voice their thoughts and opinions on the various projects in the company and make it clear that they are important to the organization.

Pocket electricity: The cost of not closing coal plants in June - NIS 1 billion
Knesset Research and Information Center report: Failure to close coal plants by June 2022 is estimated at NIS billion
• Power company: "Fuel policy is written primarily by the Department of Energy"
I know.
The economic cost of not closing coal plants by the June 2022 deadline is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is reflected in the consumer electricity tariff, which is said to be expected to rise in the coming months due to the rise in the price of coal.
In addition, an additional 900,000 tons of coal is expected to be used in 2023, which will result in additional costs to the electricity industry from the continued operation of coal-fired power plants, assuming that the price of natural gas remains significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report said that the NIS 1 billion reduction in electricity rates by 2022 would mean a reduction of about 4 percent in the cost of electricity to households.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about $200,000,000, and the total reduction for the household consumer is about 4 percent.
It should be noted that as part of the reform of the electricity sector, it was decided, among other things, to establish a subsidiary of the electricity company, which will establish natural gas-powered units, intended to replace the 4-1 coal units at the Rabin Light Site.
Following this decision, a government decision was adopted in July 2018, stipulating that the 4-1 coal production units at the Oruç Rabin power plant should cease operations.
The decision set timetables, so that the first unit with natural gas will start construction in January 2020 and its operation will start in June 2022, and accordingly the 4-1 coal production units will also cease to operate at that date.
The utility responded: "The fuel policy is written primarily by the Department of Energy.
In accordance with the decisions of the Ministry, a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas".
Paying the Price: Everything You Need to Know Ahead of the Rate Hike
Continuous cuts: Next week interest on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent
How much will the mortgage payment cost?
• What is the best way to avoid becoming overly concerned?
All the answers.
Israel's soaring inflation, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise interest rates on the shekel as early as next week.
Analyst estimates speak of a rate of increase ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.
If you do raise the interest rate by half a percent, it's already at 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
This after years of near-zero interest rates on the economy.
The sharp rise in interest rates is driving down mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and putting a drastic burden on households.
With the help of a mortgage expert, Shay Crouch, we've been looking at how much we're paying more and what's recommended to do now.
If the interest rate goes up by half a percent, how much will the monthly mortgage payment go up?
For a mortgage of $1,000,000, consisting of a 40 percent interest rate premium, the monthly payment would be $1,200.
What's the average mortgage rate since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, it's a significantly sharper increase.
This is because interest rates on the other tracks that make up a mortgage (and not just the premium tracks) have also gone up - the index-linked tracks and the fixed-rate tracks.
If the interest rate does rise by half a percent, the increase would amount, according to Schroer's estimate, to about $300 in a mortgage of about $5,000.
The prime route (40% of this route) will add about $1.50 to the price, assuming a further 0.5% increase next month.
A narrowly-controlled variable-interest path (26.7% on this path) will complete an increase of about $1.
The fixed-interest path - not a tight rate (33.3% on this path) will be priced at 220 shekels.
So what's the best thing to do today?
For those with a mortgage that's mostly adjoining, Schroer recommends considering recycling to non-adjoining tracks.
For mortgage borrowers whose monthly repayments have increased significantly and who are struggling to meet repayments - he recommends looking into recycling a mortgage and re-scaling it over a longer period.
This is to reduce the payments despite the increase in interest, since it is always better to meet the returns than to be in a bankruptcy.
For new mortgage borrowers, he strongly recommends getting to know the different pathways and tailoring the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
So in the future when interest rates go down, they can do mortgage recycling with minimal early-payment fees.
For buyers of receivable-subsidized apartments, Schroer recommends paying the receivable upfront and taking out a mortgage now.
It should be noted that the construction contribution index increases the property price significantly even after the purchase contract is signed.
The housing-building-contribution-price index rose last year by 6.6%.
In light of the increase in this index, the previous day the Banking Supervision Authority announced that it was considering the creation of a mechanism that would allow the inclusion of attachments in mortgages, but the final decision on the issue has not yet been made.
The price of fuel is going up - and the Israelis will have to pay in July more than 8 shekels per liter
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price for a liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08 shekels.
At the same time, extended until the end of 2022 the reduction of half a shilling per liter in the tax on solar energy will be reduced by half a shilling per liter.
A decade high: Gasoline will jump 36 cents a liter - and stand at more than 8 cents a liter starting July 1.
The new price for a liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08 and those who want to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 cents per liter.
At the same time, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the solar tax will be extended until the end of 2022 - so the tax authorities reported.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continued rise in oil prices, against the backdrop of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in the dollar.
If it weren't for the half-shekel government subsidy since April, gasoline would have hit an all-time high of 8.25 shekels per liter.
The tax credit expires at the end of July, and the IRS and Treasury are currently promoting a public comment announcement of an order extending the reduction in gasoline tax, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
Also, starting August 10, another reduction of another half shekel will be set, so that from this date only the price of a liter of gasoline will be reduced by one shekel until November 15, 2022.
That's what the IRS said.
"We've reached a point where I can't remember five months in a row of surplus in the state's income.
We started a few months ago with the solar tax cut.
We've been working for a week on extending the gasoline and diesel tax by four months instead of half a shekel.
It's good for industry and good for the citizen.
If we lower it, it'll affect inflation, reduce production and lower the cost of living.
As Minister of Finance, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus primarily on this", Minister Lieberman said at the Horvitz Conference on Economy and Society of the Israel Institute for Democracy.
Today, more than half of the price of gasoline is taxed by the government (blue tax and excise tax) - a higher rate than in most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business spending, public transportation and airfares, transportation costs, and more.
For the third time in a row, Ashdod - the most business-friendly city
• The opening of a new office in the city of Barcelona, Spain, has been a major step forward in the development of the city's tourism sector.
Followed by: Streets, Ashkelon and first to score •
Minister Barbibay: "Corona has highlighted the importance of local government in business development"
I know.
Ashdod is the most friendly city for small and medium businesses.
This is the third year in a row - this is how the Doing Business in Local Authorities Index of the Small and Medium Business Agency of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranks local authorities, found.
Second place is the city of hope and third place is the streets.
The following are listed in order of their location: Ashkelon, First Zion, Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Beth-Im, Nethaniah, and the sons of Barak.
The agency compiles the local authority index.
This is the fifth time and it aims to be a tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance with other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as to analyze its performance in the areas in which it is active.
The index is based on several parameters tested by each authority, which test the level of "friendliness" of the authority to businesses in its territory.
The index divides municipalities into three size groups by population, as a municipality of up to 50,000 inhabitants is not the same as a municipality of more than 150,000 inhabitants.
T.A. jumped this year.
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings for each local authority: business satisfaction, accessibility to tenders, accessibility to information and innovation.
The ranking shows that Jan's ranking dropped from second to eighth, Kim's from fourth to 12th, and Nathan's from fifth to 13th.
A downgrade does not mean that the Authority's business service has deteriorated, and in many cases it is because other authorities' business service has improved more and they have moved up the ranking, while the Authority that has been downgraded has improved less its business services.
Among the newcomers to the ranking are the Port of Hope, which rose from sixth to second, and the Streets, which rose from 12th to third.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place in 2019 to 11th, improved in 2021 to sixth place.
"Business - The Engine of Growth"
The ranking shows that the Galilee landscape leads local authorities with between 50,000 and 150,000 inhabitants.
It is followed by the Karyat Maschkin, the Binyamin headquarters, the intelligence of the Bad Mutya, the village of Baba, the freshness, the rivers, the Carmiel, the Apula and the Great Sharon.
In 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The measure is designed to encourage local authorities to facilitate small and medium-sized businesses, from the moment they open their businesses to their activities with the authorities", says Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Barbibai.
"Business is a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and accounts for about 50% of the business output and about 60% of the employment in the economy.
Small business development is a public interest for all of us, but the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses that are there.
Corona has highlighted the importance of local government and we have seen that authorities that have acted to encourage the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, have become the first government interface for them".
Ren Koithi, director of the Small and Medium-Sized Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities have a central and vital role in the ability of businesses in their area to thrive and flourish.
In the last two years, as we've been dealing with the coronavirus crisis, authorities have had a greater say in helping businesses survive in their area and survive in general".
2021 in March: 20 packages for every household - and a jump in weight
46.6 million parcels arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020
The average weight per package stands at 435 grams - a jump of 36% compared to 2020
The busiest month: December, when the average package weighed 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million postal packages arrived in Israel, almost 20 packages on average per household - according to Israel Post data obtained by Israel Today.
The number of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019 - when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there was a jump of more than 36 percent year over year in the weight of packages from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, a jump of 36% compared to 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight of a package has jumped 60 percent in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The increase in package weight is mainly influenced by two main trends, both from the seller and the buyer side: the large overseas shopping sites are uniting items for one delivery and no longer send each product from the shopping cart in a separate package.
On the Israeli consumer side, the fast delivery of the shipments, within a few days of ordering, supports the purchase of more everyday products such as clothing and gifts, which the buyers want to receive near the purchase.
In 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month with the highest number of packages from abroad is December, with 4.2 million packages weighing a total of 2,200 tons.
In December the average weight of a package was 1,800 pounds [524 g], 20 percent higher than the annual average.
Black Friday effect
More packages arrived in December than any other month, likely in the wake of November's shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles' Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
The big orders start arriving in Israel a week or two after the purchase.
Research: Most tenants in the economy are unaware that tax refunds can be obtained
Many tenants receive money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of shekels
You changed jobs?
You went to space?
You moved from the city to the settlement?
You may be entitled to a lump sum in a simple procedure.
All the details - inside
Most tenants are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to large sums.
The state comptroller said in a report from about two months ago that two million employees are eligible for a tax refund of NIS 3.6 billion, which means you should check to see if you're eligible for a tax refund.
Many employees can get a large amount, as four out of five employees are eligible for a tax refund.
In practice, however, several tens of thousands of employees are served each year.
If you think that money has been wasted, think again: employees can file for a tax refund for six years back.
Tax:On conducted an in-depth survey of 4,000 of its clients on their tax returns during 2020.
It has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their dispersion by demographic groups and by gender, age and geography.
The data shows that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of workers to the US, there were several significant changes, and in the center of them was a 15% increase in the average amount of reimbursement to the parent, which stood at 4,300 shekels per year.
The reason is that the initial costs are lower than the wages and therefore there is a gap between what the worker paid in taxes and what he actually needs.
Incidentally, the highest return received in 2020 by a customer of the company was NIS 121,054 for returns over the past 6 years.
What can you get a tax refund on?
One of the reasons to get a tax refund is a change of workplace.
Eighty-one percent of people who changed jobs during the year received an average tax refund of $2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of women who gave birth and were on maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were entitled to an average of £3,538 in that year.
Another reason to give back is donations.
100% of the people who donated and paid taxes got their refunds.
Another factor in the return is the failure to register alimony credit points.
The divorced ones haven't updated their alimony deductions, so the tax refund for each year that hasn't updated their deductions is $2,616.
Due to unemployment - Expenditure on the US: 93% of those who went to work or unemployment and who earned more than 12,000 shekels received a tax refund of 4021 shekels for that year.
Other reasons for a tax refund are: a refund for life insurance payments, life insurance on a mortgage, a refund for a capital gain, a refund for losses in securities, no registration of credit points for a man for birth and a split of the tax refund by geographical location.
94% of people who had a personal life insurance policy or a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In a check on every million dollars of mortgage for 25 years, the cumulative tax refund for the period is over 20,000 dollars for the entire mortgage term.
100% of the beneficiaries received a tax refund for the year of transfer, since the residence permit for the beneficiary is only granted after 12 months from the date of the beneficiary's becoming a beneficiary, and thus in fact the first year is fully taxed.
79% of the clients holding securities were eligible for tax refunds in those years.
However, it is important for a stockholder to check annually since losses are not rolled over from year to year but only by filing a report.
56% of men who have a child don't take credit in the year of birth in the paycheck.
The payback rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over six years.
It's a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tax:on CEO Tal Karmon: "The coronavirus crisis has made the Israeli wage-earning public much more active.
He's interested, he's checking and he's demanding what he's owed in income tax returns.
It turns out that sitting at home, on leave or after being fired, by hundreds of thousands of Israelis for months on end, has caused many hired hands to think deeply about what they deserve from the country.
It's important to know that today all the procedures for getting tax returns can be done digitally, easily and simply, without the red tape that deterred many in the past".
The job market: fewer applicants, higher pay
Alljobs report for the 2021 roundup: Top of the demand - jobs with no experience
• The number of jobs offered increased by 50%
"Looking for a Job, But Not Storming the Market"
In the year just ended, there was a 15% decrease in the number of resumes sent, and on average only 23 candidates competed for each position, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year - according to a report by the AllJobs website summarizing the year 2021, on the coronavirus crisis and its effects on the Israeli labor market.
According to the report, job seekers were most interested in the job search fields of administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, the inexperienced jobs led the search with more than 38,000 searches - likely due to the return of young people with no professional experience to look for immediate work after the initial payday.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and security had just under 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the corona crisis, the salary in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average salary in Israel stood at 11,675 shekels gross.
The average monthly salary in software was $17,915, and in information systems analysis it was $17,140.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a wage gap of more than 2,000 shekels: in the center of the country it was 12,500 shekels on average, compared to 10,795 in the north and 10,135 in the south.
Gender-wise, the average gender pay gap, which can also be explained by the type of work and the amount of hours worked, remained at 36%.
Men earned NIS 13,295, compared to the women's salary of NIS 9,740.
Trying to get back on track.
On the business side, there was exponential growth in almost every sector of the economy, and businesses were hungry for hands-on work.
So, the job supply increased by 50% and a record of more than 40,000 jobs in the Ohlsjos.
A survey of employers by the site found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of them indicated their intention to increase the number of recruits but 72% understand that they will have difficulty doing so this year.
The largest bid was for jobs with no experience -- and there were over 58,000 of them on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration with about 44,000 jobs in each area, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 vacancies, and warehouses still in demand with 19,000 vacancies.
Einav Bymfeld, director of research and content at Alljobs: "Job seekers are trying to get back to work but are not storming the market, mainly because they lack attractive jobs.
Also, the long disconnection from the work cycle makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living".
The unemployment rate in Israel has risen to 6.3%
The Bureau's survey data shows that about 270,000 Israelis were unemployed in December 2021.[1]
In November, there were 262,000 unemployed.
The unemployment rate in the first half of December 2021 stood at 6.3%, about 270,000 Israelis, compared to 6.1% in the second half of November 2021 (about 262,000).
This is according to the Central Bureau of Statistics' Human Resources Survey for the first half of December 2021.
The unemployment rate stood at 4.5% in the first half of December 2021 compared to 4.3% in the second half of November 2021.
In other words, it's 193,000 unemployed versus 180,3000.
According to the characteristics of the labor force in the first half of December 2021 among those aged 15 and over, this population included 6,607,500 residents in Israel, not including institutions and communities outside the settlements.
Of these, 64.4%, or 4,252,700 are in the labor force and the remaining 2,354,800 are not in the labor force.
Of those in the labor force, 95.5% of the 4,059,700 are employed and the rest are unemployed.
Of those not in the labor force, 2.3% have stopped working due to layoffs or closures since March 2020.
The Manpower Survey provides information on the Israeli workforce and is conducted on a regular basis by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
In the first half of December 2021, 8,700 people aged 15 and over were interviewed on a regular basis.
In the second half of November 2021, 8,900 people aged 15 and over were interviewed on a regular basis.
The survey population includes permanent residents of the State of Israel, tourists and temporary residents who have been in Israel for more than one year continuously.
The survey allows the development of the labour force, its size and characteristics, the level of unemployment and more to be monitored.
"Unforgettable": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
• Celebrates the fact that "we can live as we want", is excited about meeting the audience and makes sure to spend time with the children
This weekend and the independence day of the Shaman Koby, Subliminal.
What's your typical Friday?
"The weekends are the most important moments in life, for me.
The sacred and the traditional are very deeply rooted in my soul.
My Fridays are dedicated to the children, Orr (10) and Jonathan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and sacraments, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play cars on a board.
Sometimes we go to the beach, or even just to wash the car, but we always stop to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store - and there's always another excuse.
When we return home with the spoils of the gifts, the smells of the cooking greet us".
How's your Friday dinner looking?
♪ I've been blessed with cooks around me ♪
Next to me is a Persian-Tunisian kitchen, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, song and joy.
From my wife Ines' side, who's also a great cook, comes the Ukrainian food, which is deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
By the time we get to my mother-in-law, the lobby of her apartment is already emitting amazing smells.
I usually do the consecration with the children, who know it by heart.
After all, my fun after dinner is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of bloat".
Do you have any special childhood memories from the weekends?
"As a child, I would wake up on Saturday to the sounds of Israeli music on J and the pale-colored tracking devices we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually to the north.
Every remote corner of the land made his heart proud.
He died three months ago of a serious illness, and to him, Shabbat and Lent were sacred days, especially since the whole family had to be together.
I recently released a song in his honor called "Suspending You", which I created with Usher Cohen.
I believe he would have been proud of this piece, which celebrates the bond between father and son".
As a zealous Zionist, how do you feel about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a sacred day to me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who is allowed to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I was already climbing trees and being tied to a house of ropes with Israeli flags.
Now my days of independence are filled with performances, and I'm always met by a madly happy crowd, celebrating that we can live as we please.
We have to make sure that our children, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren have that option, and remember that nothing is taken for granted".
Her Friday: Estee Zackheim blessing the Sabbath
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": a Friday dinner that Sati Zakheim dreams of, and how does she deal with the fact that her husband keeps a Sabbath?
Tell me about your willingness to sit down
I know.
"Preparations begin as early as Thursday night, when I return from a show or workshop and cook until three o'clock in the morning all that requires long cooking such as goulash, shade and moisturizers.
On Friday, the first part of the day, I spend time with myself, meeting with friends and colleagues for coffee, a show or a movie, or I go to rehearsals.
Summer holidays come late, and I have a lot of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch a sunset or just a good show.
For Saturday dinner, I usually invite my mother, Verda, who is celebrating her 89th birthday, and friends".
Can we share more cooking?
♪ I like shortcuts ♪
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry them.
On my Saturday table, you can find steak, vegan tofu, potatoes and cabbage in the oven.
Most of the cooking is done by me, and they're heated on the stove on Saturdays, of course.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and in the winter - the chulnut".
Your husband is a religious man and you come from a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with a Sabbath keeper is an infinite compromise.
"And love thy neighbor as thyself", went the way of it.
Family outings he can't go on, so I found myself packing up the kids and joining friends' families outings a lot.
Plus, I'm the kids' shift driver, the one who picks them up on Friday nights from parties and get-togethers.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Sabbath, because I usually don't show up on Saturday and get a sort of 'forced leave' - and that's a good thing".
Who would you like to have over on Saturday?
"I would open a big table and invite my dead.
Sometimes I wonder what it would be like if my brother Daniel, Jr., were alive, or if my father, Shneur, Jr., could see my children, Uriel, 23, and the twins Tamar and Naamah, 16.
We probably fought about football and politics and brands and stuff".
Do you have any special childhood memories from the weekends?
"We were a warm and united family.
Friday afternoons, Mom would make a pile of noodles, bring hummus and lures from the market, and burn the garlic for a salad.
Then we'd go to Aunt Hannah's with Elijah's hand, or as she used to say, "Elijah's hand", and she'd make linchpins.
Since I was the only one who didn't like raisins, she'd make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the little one, and she worried about me.
On Saturdays, my father and I would tour the port of Jaffa, and he would show us how he and his twin brother, Grisha, had come to this country with nothing".

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are engaged.
Nearly two decades after their love story ended in divorce, Lopez and Aflek are back in each other's arms.
Lopez parted ways with baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021
I know.
His one: almost two decades after their first love affair ended in divorce and a year after their reuniting, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic circle and getting engaged.
The happy news was shared last night by Lopez with her fan on her official website onthejlo.com
I know.
News of the engagement comes a week after Lopez was reported to be spinning as a giant diamond ring was clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative for her confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
As a reminder, the last time Shaflak, 49, pulled a ring and offered Lopez, 52, to be his forever was in 2002, and it was a dazzling ring with a giant, six-carat pink diamond, worth an estimated $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gestures of love, the two separated in 2004, accusing the media of being overly obsessive and relentlessly poking around in their lives.
Since then, Affleck has managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez has been married three times before, including to singer Mark Anthony, who together became parents to twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she separated in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including a two-year engagement.
The Kardashians are saying, "You can't make up what happens to you".
"The Chaos That Never Ends", Chris Jenner's mother insists on the new series starring the reality show's first family, and gets backing from her daughters and the new producer
In an article that will be published in "Saturday" magazine, they talk about big money, the PR mill, the branding industry and the change Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm no longer the one who spends hours thinking about which bikini selfie to upload".
It may come as a surprise to many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 for the Disney content empire, which also includes Marvel and Star Wars, among other things, is the Kardashians.
Details of the reality TV and social media family's first contract with Disney have not been disclosed, but estimates claim a minimum of $100 million has been transferred to the family's daughters, who now also serve as producers.
At a press conference with the stars, each of them accompanied by a whole beauty crew who take care of the makeup, hair and wrinkles in clothes without stopping, the girls of the family, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it is not reality, this time what is received on the screen is completely authentic.
"You can't invent what happens to us", says the family's mother, Chris Jenner, emphatically. "The chaos is endless".
"We're showing how much we've grown since that show came out in 2007", says Khloe Kardashian.
"When we started, we were terrified, "there's a lot going on in our lives, "and you can't just wrap everything up in a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
A lot of plots were rushed through the edit, wrapped in pop-up color film and left on the side.
This is not what real life is like.
Now we're more exposed, facing the camera naturally, not just reality but authentic documentary".
When confronted with their new involvement in the production of the series, which in effect gives them complete control over the content that is received on screen, Chloe states: "We are involved behind the scenes, seeing footage as it is edited and giving feedback, but not from a position of patronage but simply giving our opinion on what would make the series better.
It's a reflection of our lives and I personally feel I've experienced emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they're more of a boundary-setter".
"I have grown up".
Kim Kardashian, for her part, continues to vigorously change her image from a cheap reality trash to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I grew up", she says, "raising four black children, which means from a marginalized community that is badly marginalized in this country.
I want to change reality so that my children and the children of all my friends have a different future, hopefully we can heal this crooked system.
That's my motivation".
"I'm not the same Kim who spends hours thinking about which bikini selfie to post", she insists, "but it's not completely gone from my life, either.
A man must be true to who he really is and take everything for granted".
The reasons for the producer's firing that Ryan Seacrest discovered and their new and very profitable path in the industry, the meaning of the move to Disney, the family's greasy old sewing machine and its impact on the brand's profitability and more, in a full article to be published in Sessions magazine.

Spring of the Vine and the Harvest of Hadad: An Outdoor Festival in Jerusalem that Creates New Surprises
The International Festival in Beirut, which has become a tradition and will be held in several venues, will feature musical performances by leading local artists, and will combine circus performances and innovative and surprising artistic performances.
I know.
As every summer over the years, along with the heat, humidity and boredom of the students, comes the International Outdoor Festival created by Jerusalem, which has already become a tradition in Beirut and will be held in several locations (including Mitchell Garden, the Sultan's Pool, in front of the Tower of David and at the foot of the Old City Walls) - between August 15-27.
As part of the festival, there will be musical performances by many artists every day, including Sherit Haddad, Kobi Peretz, Spring of Vine and Ta'avit, who will host Natasha's friends, Shalomi Shabbat, Eida Habib, Nathan Ghosn, Nasrin Kadri, Danny Sanderson who will host Theslam and Amir Daddon, Nega Erez and more.
Along with the music, there will be two interesting shows this year.
The first is ARTISTA - an exhibition of illuminated public space displays (designed by Philippe Blau) with other galactic figures that will move among visitors inside a structure and present an entire adventure in light and at night.
The theatrical performance will combine dancers, actors, and physical theater artists to connect with the audience.
SPARKS is a circus, movement and aerial show by Circus Y, an Instagram photography exhibition inspired by famous artworks.
The Black Box Gallery  is the creator and operator of the Lior Kalfon's gaze gallery, set up in the fairgrounds with gaze holes that exposed the audience to the exhibition of his fluorescent works of Lior Kalfon, artworks of illuminated sculptures by the multi-disciplinary artist Alon Birger (Theatre of Light) and more.
Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The winner of "The Next Star" finds a second single and returns to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song is about how to keep the connection at a distance", he says.
Tamir Greenberg on the second single Into The Night after winning the audience with his first single and participating in "The Next Star".
In recent months Greenberg has continued to perform at many venues: the TSA Cultural Hall, the TSA Opera House, the Shawnee Amphitheater, the Joshua Gardens Amphitheater, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
Into The Night was produced and mixed by Greenberg with producer Sitio Begger.
The video, directed by Darya Geller, brings back to Zamir his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song is about the relationship between my father and me.
"I was thinking about the time I left the country for the United States and how to keep in touch from a distance", Greenberg says.
Next month, Greenberg will perform at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and for the new season of "The Next Star", the song with which he won the show, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Yubel Shemall is the biggest winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world.
The phenomenon climbed Mount Madouriama in 26 seconds and earned the title of "the first Israeli ninja".
Queen Yogbe climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but won't hold the title of Ning.
The
There's a winner: Yuval Shemal won the Midoriama, and he's the winner of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel" and now he holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and 16th in the world.
Who's been on the show since its first season, then finished in first place, and then lost to Gil Merenz in the second season.
In the third season he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during the filming he declared that it would be the last season.
Tonight he made his first ascent of Mount Midoriyama in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after a man over the other contestants was crowned Queen Vishhi Kalpan.
His queen managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished second.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in any season, only one ninja can be crowned who has managed to climb the Midoriyama in time.
So despite Queen's impressive achievement, as it is believed that the season winner climbed the Midoriyama 3 seconds faster, Queen does not win the World Ninja title.
He can compete for it again next season.
Well, we understand that full of superhero, perfect rock beat, and Ninja Israel is the most important sporting event in the world.
I know.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat in the finals of a reality show and acted like it was the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
I know.
We think that the rock is such a perfect female ideal that it's distorted to portray it that way on television.
She makes more money campaigning than Wonder Woman, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when it comes down to it, she can also advocate for her business partner.
She's a mother and a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and hosts reality shows and series, and serves as an unconceivable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that their rock-crossing service is too perfect, because on the show she hosts, you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the world of the ninja, everyone is bigger than life, and the guides come first.
Ace Azari was involved in an affair that was supposed to erase him from the screen for a period of time, but because he is not an ordinary human being - he was rescued from it before the first batch of ads.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Neve Raskin, who has broadcast European and World Cup victories in his life, but is excited by a mega-wall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
Two Olympic medalists (Jordan Gerbi and Lena Ashram) sat beside him as commentators in the finale, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality are the entrance conditions to the superhuman world that this reality show has presented for four seasons.
Ninja Israel went out of their way to market the season, which ended last night with Midoriama and Yubel Shama who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned Ninja.
There was an almost impassable trail that led one after another to the demise of all the superhuman characters whose egos the program had been inflating throughout the year.
You want to be a ninja deer?
Not with us.
This is where they look for superheroes.
Emphasis was placed on finding an heir for the Messiah, the one called "the King of kings and the only one like him", and other titles that were intended to emphasize his perfection and uniqueness.
As a result, the difficulty level was raised, the girls who tried to compete in the season's tracks crashed, and the boys competed with each other to see who had the most squares in their bellies and the charisma of a dick to fit into the shoes of the Porsche fullback.
It may be said that it is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges, but for the vast majority of viewers - average Kurosawa potatoes like us - Ninja Israel cultivates for us a model of athletic achievement that is unimaginable.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gilles Sésover moves between punch-ups and talk of holiness,
It's strange to see comedian X from Comedy Store hosting Saturday Night Live on Channel 14, where he's filling up the dishes and giving the stage to mostly men.
If we play an association game, we all have similar answers to the question, "What reminds you of the concept of'readiness to sit down'?"
Say, "Spoon and cleaning, gas stoves and staircase smells, Yaron Elan or my father as a TV chef, " but the weirdest thing would be if someone suddenly said, "Gil Sassover".
Because Gil Scavo in the middle of sponge and cooking is the most unrelated thing television has to offer.
And indeed, "Saturday's Reception", the new show he hosts on Friday afternoons on Channel 14, is cut off in spirit from the hour it airs.
Halfway through it, Sassoure is standing.
He speaks quickly, holds a microphone even when tasting dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punch and talk of holiness.
In his defense, the budget is felt to be meager, and that's probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what is still exciting about the premiere, which was broadcast the other day from headquarters in Binyamin, is the clear gender division.
The men sang, played, danced, spoke, marketed restaurants and factories - while the women contented themselves with a small item, in which they excitedly told about running a tailor's shop.
Happy women's day to you.
Saturday reception with Gil Sessover, now 14.
The protected housing association v. Ruthie Rousseau: "To say 'this has the flavor of protected housing' hurts our business".
Chairwoman Julie Gath sent a letter expressing the union's complaint against what they claim is an offensive remark by the judge of "The Next Restaurant" in one of the trailers for the show.
Ruthie Rousseau responded, "I'm glad there are places that are investing more in the cuisine of this population".
The Association of Orphanages and Protected Housing in Israel against "The Next Restaurant": In a letter sent by the chairman Yuli Gath and reached by "Israel Today" it is written: "In the preview before the broadcast, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said 'food has the taste of protected housing', that is, food from a closed institution with food of low quality".
"The tone chosen by the show's judge, Ruthie Rousseau, to describe her disappointment with the food the contestant submitted immediately cancels out our long-standing effort to combat the ignorance in the field, which is because sheltered housing groups operate in houses other than restaurants for the benefit of tenants with the highest quality chef's meals".
It added: "Service teams and home managers are fighting for the image of safe housing that offers quality housing solutions for the elderly, including reduced loneliness, abundant recreational activities, a high standard of living and more".
In Israel in recent years more and more families and older people are realizing that loneliness is the most difficult disease of old age and are seeing community spaces as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of the greatest pleasures in life, so we devote resources and effort to serving the residents the finest food.
Most sheltered housing uses professional chefs to build a menu.
We would be happy to invite the judging team at any time to be impressed by the winning dishes served daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff at the sheltered housing, we would like to ask for your forgiveness and clarification.
Let's come together, media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly".
Ruthie Rousseau responded: "I'm glad there are places that are investing more in the cuisine of this population, who definitely deserve great food in the later stages of life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, butchers, chefs and chefs everywhere, even in sheltered housing".
"Double standard: in Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't?"
Nick Cave responds to the criticism
The singer was responding to criticism by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards.
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
♪
Nick Cave cancelled a show in Russia earlier this week because of the war and announced that he was "standing by Ukraine and praying that the madness will end soon".
In doing so, the highly regarded Australian singer joined artists and bands like Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled shows in the invading country.
But in Cave's case, his cancellation message took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet has denounced the singer as a hypocrite, since in 2017 he refused to cancel two concerts in Israel, despite much criticism from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to Israel, Keib told the local media: "Ultimately, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians".
The same Ahmed remembered well the statements of Cave in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even posted on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", a scathing post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying state, and therefore the situation of Palestine is identical to the situation of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your message about Ukraine", Ahmed wrote. "That you did not support the Palestinians, who are also suffering from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion Israel is the primary cause of Palestinian suffering.
It saddens me very much, since you represent a double standard here", the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story didn't end there, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmed in a long and detailed letter, in which he stressed that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first scenario is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, hoping to change the security order of the whole of Europe.
The second situation is a complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts do have one thing in common, though, that innocent people who share a tragic fate are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel a great sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are and who they are".
Cave added that while he does not want to elaborate on his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he is certainly supportive of the Palestinians as well, noting that the last 20 years have seen a lot of participation in fundraising events for them.
"But this is not the time for arguments, Ahmet", the singer clarified, "it is the time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently suffering a catastrophe on their soil.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians are strongly opposed to the actions of the Putin regime.
If I could play for them, I would".
In light of the decline in illness, the Corona Project will return to run Ziyu Hospital.
Prof. Salman Zarqa was appointed in July 2021 and led the policy of treating the third and fourth wave of the coronavirus.
At the request of Minister of Health, Nitsan Horowitz, will continue in parallel in his role as projector.
Professor Zarka: "We are glad that the Omicron wave continues to subside, but we still have to prepare for another wave"
I know.
With the corona outbreak in full swing, Corona projector Professor Salman Zarqa will return to run Ziu Hospital in Soweto on Sunday.
At the request of the Minister of Health, Nitsan Horowitz, will continue in parallel in his role as projector.
"I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to subside and we have received our normal life back", said Prof. Zarqa, adding: "We still have a duty to prepare for another wave of illness as a result of the virus still being here, in Israel and around the world".
Prof. Zarqa was appointed in July 2021 and led the third and fourth wave of the Corona treatment policy.
As of 1 May, Israel returned to a "between-waves" state, which includes reducing most of the corona values, while maintaining capabilities to perform serial tests and investigations, which would form the basis for action in case a new variant is discovered.
A Hidden Illness
The National Knowledge and Information Center's report on the Corona campaign, released this morning, noted that "there has been a decline in the average number of new confirmed cases to below 2,000 per day, on a weekly average, alongside a decline in the number of hospitalized and critically ill patients".
However, they emphasized that "there is a significant underlying disease and in practice the number of infections is much higher.
The number of institutional tests performed in the community (not including re-tests from abroad, M.I.) is low, standing at less than 20,000 tests on average per week alone.
The low scope of testing makes it difficult to identify and understand disease trends".
State Comptroller's report: The actual budget for most of the years of the Medicare Basket Committee  is less than the recommended budget
According to the report by Matthias Engelmann, for more than 20 years of the Hassel operation, the Ministry of Health did not supervise the activities of the committee.
The report also said that the minutes of meetings are published with a significant delay, if any.
The Ombudsman also recommends that the Subcommittee's activities be made more transparent and that the procedures for the work of the ESC be updated.
Another deficiency found concerns the fact that since the committee began its activities, the Ministry of Health did not ask the hospital funds for reports on the extent of the use and utilization of the drugs that were cancelled, which would have allowed to analyze and control the budget allocated to them.
The Medicare Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees in our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the commission decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the hospital funds  but a new report by the state inspector published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without control reports on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council monitoring and examining its activities.
Israel Today correspondent Ren Reznik adds that the state complainant's investigation was conducted following Israel Today's ongoing exposes of drug cartels.
According to the report by Matthew Engelman, it recommends "rectification and improvement in the expansion of the health care basket, leading to better utilization of the health care basket budget to which the public is entitled".
Throughout the years of the existence of the mechanism of the supplement to the drug basket, in the years 2021-1998 drugs were added to the state budget for a total of eight billion NIS, with the supplement moving annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million NIS.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the health care basket, with a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated to the expansion of the basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.
For most of the committee's existence (90% of the time), the budget surcharge was less than 1.5% of the health care basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired surcharge rate.
The complainant notes that the annual premium needs to be examined and adjusted in order to allow for long-term certainty and planning.
Engelmann also noted that "the transparency model of basketwork is flawed".
For example, the Hassel Committee's working procedure states that minutes of meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 160-109 days, while sometimes the minutes of final meetings are not published at all.
"The delay in publishing protocols impairs the transparency of decisions; as a result, the ability of bidders  patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies  to submit re-applications as soon as possible and relevant, after having learned lessons from their bids' postponement, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and amended their bids and reassessed their readiness to accept them in the next round, may be impaired", the reviewer noted in the report.
"The Ministry of Health shall publish the protocols in accordance with the timetables set forth in the protocol".
Of the thousands of submissions, only one economic comment was submitted.
Another criticism of Engelmann concerns the preliminary process of assessing technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The reviewer found that half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the postponement.
Another discrepancy concerns the activities of the subcommittee of the medicine basket which is closed to the media and the public, and in which patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The critic recommends that a public representative be included or that the public debate be made public without any commercial details being kept confidential.
The procedure that the Health Care Basket Committee follows states that "a financial evaluation must be submitted" to a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic evaluation has been submitted out of thousands of submissions  and the committee makes its decisions without an economic evaluation.
For example, the 2021-2019 Basel Committee hearings had applications to add anti-obesity drugs to the Basel Committee on Medicines and Health's 2021-2019 Basel Committee hearings.
The report found that the requests were not accompanied by economic estimates, including an estimate of the amount that could be saved by reducing the damage of obesity-related diseases or by being able to avoid gastric bypass surgery.
It also appears that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
For example, the Ministry of Health in 2019 defined preventive medicine and the evaluation of the treatment of tumors in chronic diseases as targets, but in the framework of the decisions on the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these targets.
The critic also warns that since 2011 the medicine basket also includes services that are not the responsibility of the hospital funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, given by the Ministry of Health ("Third Supplement").
That is, when the legal framework for this step is only vaguely regulated.
In the last six years, NIS 74 million from the supplement to the drug basket has been used for these services.
Engelmann recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work protocols and also determine whether a separate fee is required for these services.
About a third of the new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as "no-cost drugs", which do not cost the patient any extra money because they replace existing treatment.
The reviewer suggests that the possibility of these drugs being tested on a different, shorter route be considered, so that the drug basket can be updated several times a year instead of just once a year.
There's no oversight of the use of very expensive drugs.
The audit also found that since the Basel Committee began its work 20 years ago, the Health Department has not asked the health funds to report and has not monitored the extent of the use and utilization of Basel medications, information that would have allowed the department to analyze and control the budget allocated to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports were published, relating to the years 2009-2006, and these were also published with considerable delay (the last one was published in 2007 and dealt with the use of the budget in 2009-2007).
"Delays in testing may result in difficulty in data collection and analysis, in irrelevant conclusions from testing after such a long period, in subcommittee bias and in decisions based on incomplete findings", the report said.
The office also doesn't inspect and monitor the use of very expensive drugs and hasn't conducted any tests.
These 10 drugs accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion NIS in 2021-2016).
On this, the reviewer wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct individual inspections of these drugs and technologies and analyze their use versus estimates.
The controls and analysis will allow systematic conclusions to be drawn about the work process of the Basel Committee on Subcommittees, and how to prepare and improve estimates when pricing drugs and technologies".
"Shocking and unfathomable": A heated debate in the Health Committee on the poisoning at the home of Daphne
The first patient who died had her readings correct ten minutes before her death
"If the people there cared about the kitchen being like home, it wouldn't look like this".
Ten minutes before the first patient, a 40-year-old woman from the "Dafna House" in Holon, died of food poisoning, she was taken to a medical facility where the measurements were correct, the director of the shelter claimed today (Tuesday) at a meeting of the health committee.
"We have night-time caregivers who check in during the night and a nurse who makes rounds.
There have been several reports of diarrhea and the same tenant actually had her last meters taken 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was on a stakeout like the other Dayakers with diarrhea.
She's a nursing patient, we went to get a sedative to help her move, and then that same tenant didn't respond.
We started CPR and called the nurse from the clinic", the director of the shelter described what happened last Sunday morning in the shelter.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized and approximately a quarter of the residents of the shelter (33 out of 131) suffered diarrhea for eating contaminated pork.
The director of the shelter said this in response to allegations that deaths from food poisoning were the result of neglect and lack of care by caregivers.
Dr. Naema Nuss, head of epidemiology for the U.S. Public Health Service, noted that "we cannot definitively determine what the three hijackers died of.
Only blood tests were taken".
It was also discussed that the residents who were hospitalized in the hospital could no longer be given a stool sample because they were not sick and therefore the cause of death and illness could not be determined with certainty.
Another engineer from the Ministry of Health noted that "the Ministry of Health inspects the sanitary condition of kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or for the renewal of a license".
The Ministry of Welfare admitted that an investigation committee has not yet been appointed for this case and for the previous case of humiliation of the masked that occurred three months ago at the Bnei Zion Institute in Sharon.
The chairman of the health committee, H.E. Edith Silman, said during the debate: "If people there cared that the kitchen would be like home - it wouldn't look like this.
The nursing home fireplaces need more.
They're health-sensitive and require extra care and attention.
It's shocking and incomprehensible what's been going on in there.
The terrible findings were discovered after they knew the Ministry of Health was coming to check.
Where's the oversight and accountability of the offices?
How is it that in a discussion like this, without the ministers and the CEOs, there's an explanation for what's going on here?"
Yigal Nahshumi, the CEO of the Eckstein House who runs the shelter and has run the shelter himself said, "Hundreds and thousands of people throughout the system are raised with just one goal: to do good for people.
The people who died were people I took care of personally.
You're one of the flats I've been sleeping on.
This is a shocking event for us".
Smt. Una, a former resident of the same age group, stormed up to him and said, "Enough of the lies and the pretty words.
I was there".
Gali Barmi, the representative of the parents in Akim Israel: "We have complained about the food before and did not receive the criticism".
Oren Helman, founder of the Equal Opportunities Initiative for Inclusion of People with Disabilities, protests against the anonymity of the deceased: "Their names are not even known.
They're worth less?
"disregarding the lives of our children".
Suspected malfunction in Wolfsson: the surgeon ruptured his heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure that Dr. Pras Abu Akr has performed as the director of the chest surgery unit at the hospital.
Chairman of the Medical Board complained that the director, Dr. Engel, was warned before his appointment.
Hospital: "He is appreciated and experienced"
First publication: A terrible mistake was made at the Wolfsson State Hospital in Holon, when during an operation the doctor performed a tear in the patient's heart, which led to his tragic death.
The operation on the 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19.
It was the first surgery Dr. Prass Abu Akr had performed at the hospital since he was appointed chief of the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, which was designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.
But the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, raising difficult questions about the hospital's management.
The director of the Cancer Institute and chairman of the board of medical examiners, Dr. Ronen Brenner, has demanded an investigation into the matter in a letter he delivered to the hospital's director, Dr. Annette Engel.
The letter made some very serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akr, after the previous head of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Shiba Hospital in the Shumari Valley.
A Giant Hole in the Heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient has been sober, functioning and treated by him for the past four years.
Recently, he had a recurrence of the disease, and it was discovered that there was an abnormal accumulation of fluid within the pericardium, which is where the heart muscle is located.
Also, the surgeon, Dr. Abu Akr, was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, the surgery had a serious malfunction, and Dr. Haji Dekel, director of cardiothoracic surgery at Wolfson, who was at the time operating on a child in the next room, "was rushed to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart".
He said the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressure was zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Deckel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu Akr was not professionally or personally suited to run the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and despite being the breast surgeon's direct supervisor, Dr. Engel made an unsolicited bid and accepted Dr. Abu Akr for the position.
He also said, "It's a simple procedure that takes a few minutes", and added, "We cannot ignore the flawed process of accepting Dr. Abu Akr into office.
"The question arises whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the operation and the death of the patient".
An experienced surgeon
Information and claims by other senior doctors were presented to Israel Today that support the questions raised in the article by Dr. Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shamanov, chief of surgery at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akkar is "one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon".
He also added that he was selected in a fair bid and Dr. Deckel did not participate, consistent with his statements about wanting to "disconnect" from the chest unit.
He added: "I was not a party to the proceedings either, and perhaps I should have been.
Dr. Shamanov wrote that Dr. Pras Abu Akr began work on April 10 and, as a recipient of a 100-day grace period, "all the doctors in the hospital were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.
He's done dozens of cases of this procedure before, and I'm afraid this one ended as sadly as it did.
The Wolfson Hospital said in response: "We share the family's grief.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The breast surgeon mentioned in the article is a highly respected surgeon with many years of experience, and he was selected to run the breast surgery unit of the surgical department at the Wolfson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Haghi Dekal, his quotes are inaccurate and taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very critical condition.
The hospital is looking at the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is aware of the details of the case".

The Encounter That Opened My Eyes - And Changed My Life
If I hadn't met Professor Marvin Shapira, who was the head of the infectious disease unit at Hadassah, I probably would have remained an internal medicine physician.
He's the one who got me interested in infectious disease and influenced me to do it.
I met him in the corridors of the Hesse, back in the '80s.
For a moment, I didn't think I'd leave the inpatient, because I loved the patient care itself; but Professor Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also expressed in neurology, inpatient, and in fact in every field.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
All along, I liked his inquisitive approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with all his heart and soul, who loved his patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to look at everything in depth.
He was a real, honest, selfless man, qualities that I loved very much.
At first, when I was asked to choose the doctor who had been my role model and greatest influence, I was going to choose my father, Dr. Joseph Rekober, Sr., a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a guerrilla unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine -- but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.
Both, for example, have inspired catchphrases that doctors still use today - such as "Tissu is de l'homme", where a biopsy of tissue from the affected organ helps to determine which drugs to give; or "You use it slowly, you lose it slowly", which explains that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to them.
Professor Shapira, Sr. was married to a physiotherapist who worked in engineering and father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven, I cried.
He was something -- a smart, smart epidemiologist who would do anything.
He never complained, even during his severe illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the epidemic team, and he's sorely missed in this day and age.
If he were here today, I'm sure I would have consulted him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the epidemic response team.

Dr. Shlomi Kudesh, the director of the Soroka Hospital.
About Professor Saul Socknick, who is a former professor of physics at the University of Michigan.
A mentor and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
I know.
I first met Professor Saul Socknick Jr. when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I got into the Internal Medicine rotation at the D-Department he ran.
I later returned to the department again in my sixth year, and I did my medical school thesis under his guidance, writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis.
Saul has influenced every significant juncture of my professional life for 20 years, and he's been the most significant man in shaping my character as a doctor; not only professionally, but also -- and most importantly -- personally and humanly.
During my internship, I was torn between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted with him about my specialty.
I ended up choosing to do an internal medicine residency with him in Soroca.
During my internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of areas -- in scientific writing (sorry, I wasn't persistent enough), in communicating with patients, in working with a multidisciplinary team -- an area in which the department excelled -- and, in fact, in every aspect of medicine.
To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and as a manager, traits that come from the underworld.
When I finished my internship and was hesitant to go abroad for a pay period, Saul pushed and guided me, and helped me with recommendation letters and advice on how to manage.
The recovery period was a very important time in my professional development, and without Saul's support and encouragement, I'm not sure it would have happened.
In return, when I was offered to join the hospital board, once again Saul was the one who supported and helped.
We went through some rough times together in the internal medicine department.
Saul was able to perfectly integrate the teacher, the principal, the friend and the teammate without his various roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to be as successful as he is in this particular combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and specialists, who are now found throughout the medical system in Israel, perpetuating his memory and work with their excellence.
It's an honor to be associated with this group.
The Bible is a source of inspiration for us.
Dr. Ephrath Bronn-Harlb, director of the Schneider Children's Medical Center, is a very good doctor.
I'm going to talk to you about Dr. Tommy Shinfeld.
The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Schinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at Schneider Children's, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that -- he taught me to think.
The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, sickest children.
Children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious thing is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined they would be in these complex situations in the ICU with their children.
It sounds weird, but it's the obvious.
But I learned from him even more meaningful and profound things.
Looking back, because I'm a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, I now see the connection between the worlds; the education I received from Dr. Schinfeld connects them.
Dr. Schinfeldt taught me to listen carefully to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurses, to the nursing staff, both young and old, and to listen to the parents.
All of this needs to be done not just to communicate more correctly and more efficiently, but to constantly gather as much information as possible that can prevent the next downturn.
The motivational processes in pediatric care are everywhere, and of course in intensive care.
Listening and talking generates deeper understanding, both on the part of the care team and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at the entire system.
The deeper and more rigorous the understanding, the more it incorporates all the relevant factors into the discussion, the more precise, the more tailored the decision-making process will be, and, most importantly, the sooner it can be done to prevent future, immediate or distant harm.
That's why Dr. Tommy Shinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He's a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, to listen - and then to apply.

Medical negligence in the various stages of childbirth
In order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by the same negligence.
Birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family's life.
But unfortunately, sometimes births end with severe birth or newborn injuries due to the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where birth has resulted in physical harm to the infant or the mother, there is scope to examine the chain of events that led to the injury and even to consider seeking legal advice.
A medical malpractice lawyer will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff at the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, as appropriate, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every error in treatment by the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily teach that the handling was negligent.
When is it negligence?
When the doctor's error was due to incompetence or deviation from reasonable care, and the incompetence and deviation from accepted care caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.
In this article, we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications may occur at each stage, and when they amount to medical negligence.
The junction phase
The fusion phase lasts on average between 8 and 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (to allow the fetus to pass through at birth) and should eventually reach a diameter of about four inches [10 cm].
Most cases of medical malpractice at the placenta involve the failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which has caused damage to the newborn that sometimes manifests itself in cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition that affects the brain and spinal cord.
Cerebral palsy can be caused by misidentification or delayed identification of congenital breastfeeding, which is manifested by failure to supply oxygen to the fetal brain tissue.
In general, monitoring the newborn's condition and correctly unfolding the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of developing fetal distress, allowing the medical team to quickly intervene and rescue the newborn before irreversible damage is done.
Failure to respond to signs of oxygen deprivation, or to interpret data correctly, especially on the fetal monitor, or to respond to distress on the  monitor, may be a sign of negligence.
Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a cord-slip and an undetected uterine rupture.
Even in these extreme events, it's worth checking whether the medical staff acted appropriately.
For example, attorney Anna Reif Ligenza, of the law firm of Sarrur & Co., specializing in representing medical malpractice victims, says that her office handled a lawsuit from a child who was injured during birth after the midwife punctured the amniotic sac when the fetal head was too high, causing the umbilical cord to fall (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (due to pressure from the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and resulting in a child being born with severe neurological damage.
In another case, a lawyer said that her office had filed a lawsuit for gross medical negligence by a staff member in the maternity ward of a large hospital who, during the birth, failed to identify at the time clear signs that would have led to the suspicion that the child was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of the previous pregnancy.
The fetus that escaped through the rift in its mother's uterus into the womb space suffered severe fetal distress until its late release when it was on the verge of death.
Due to severe fetal distress during his birth the child was left with a complex neurological disability.
We emphasize that in order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal relationship between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the lactating mother and the damage caused to the newborn, that is, that the damage was caused by such negligence and not by any other cause or factor.
The causal relationship will be examined using medical criteria that the medical literature has found to be the only causal relationship between the stroke and the brain injury.
Among other things, the fetus' blood acidity index, its appendix scores, the presence of neurological and systemic damage, and more are tested.
Death of the fetus
The active birth stage
The active stage of labor begins when the cervix opening reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical phase.
Having a baby and avoiding a C-section
In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., the lack of progress of the active birth process.
In such cases, a caesarean section is performed to prevent various possible fetal injuries due to delayed delivery.
"There are cases where failure to perform a C-section on time could cause irreversible harm to the fetus", explained lawyer Rafe-Ligonza.
"For example, we have filed a medical malpractice claim of a child's death caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.
Contrary to any accepted medical practice, the medical staff had not been trained to recognize fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the operation caused extensive systemic damage to Lilouda which eventually led to her death shortly after birth".
Negligence in the birth of a vacuum
In situations where the mother is pregnant or the fetus is in significant danger requiring a particularly rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.
In this process, a vacuum dome is attached to the fetus' head and the fetus is forcibly pulled out.
This is inherently dangerous and can cause harm to both the fetus and the child, and it requires great care, precision, and skill.
In these cases, medical malpractice may be manifested by the physician not following the mandatory instructions and performing the operation despite the existence of contraindications, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performing it for too long or when despite the failure of several attempts the physician continues and repeats the operation more than the number of attempts allowed.
In these cases if the negligent vacuum operation caused birth defects  among others it could cause cranial damage and bleeding that could cause the development of brain damage  there is room for a damages claim.
Paralysis on the name of ERB
Paralysis of the spine, here's congenital nerve damage in the cervical spine and when it occurs during childbirth it's worth checking to see if the damage was caused by the negligence of the delivery team.
The injury manifests in weakness of the hand muscles and can reach a complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in delivering the newborn due to the occurrence of shoulder fleas - a maternity emergency that whispers when the fetus' shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.
When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the fetal weight estimate indicated that the fetus was macrosomal, meaning that it was expected to be born weighing more than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and according to guidelines it is preferable to deliver the mother by cesarean section.
When the newborn weighs more than 10 pounds, a cesarean section should be considered in light of risk factors including gestational diabetes and prolonged second stage labor.
In the event that the medical team ignores the fetal weight abnormality or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder dislocation and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that medical negligence is involved.
Indeed, in U.S.C. 2694/90 the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk of shoulder deformity during childbirth can be predicted with varying degrees of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder deformity where it is suspected is by cesarean section".
The placenta is released
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to uterine contractions after the baby's exit and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process usually lasts up to a half hour from the time the baby is delivered and is often spontaneous, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the discharge, the medical team will check to see if she's completely discharged or if there are any parts of her uterus left.
At this stage, complications can occur that can cause serious damage to the fetus.
One of the most common complications of uterine prolapse is called Ashman's syndrome, a uterine scar caused by inflammation caused by uterine prolapse, a condition that affects the lining of the uterus in a way that prevents pregnancy.
So in cases where the medical team did not identify that she had residual uterine fibroids or did not take all the necessary measures to prevent uterine fibroids from being damaged despite the suspicion of uterine residual uterine fibroids, it may be a case of medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer.
Death in childbirth
Maternal death during childbirth is a rather rare occurrence.
In these cases, the event that should have brought happiness and joy to the whole family turns, unfortunately, into the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother on time or responds late to such bleeding.
"For example", explained Attorney Reif-Ligenza, "our office filed a lawsuit concerning the death of a newborn, in which the medical staff ignored and failed to respond to the worrying vital signs of the newborn for long hours, and later diagnosed massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the underlying disease she suffered from".
"In another case", said Attorney Reif-Ligenza, "our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding from an improperly sutured caesarean section.
In the same case, the woman complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, responding only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death".
Loss of uterus
In severe cases, medical negligence at birth can lead to a hysterectomy, says lawyer Rafe Lingza: "Our office has filed a lawsuit against a hospital that performed a hysterectomy because of medical negligence after birth.
In that case the mother, a young woman of 31, lost her uterus due to inadequate treatment of massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after birth and yet no timely action was taken that could have prevented the damage".
What are the damages awarded in medical malpractice at birth?
Maternity compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, loss of wages and pension to the injured and even to his parents and other damage components.
Compensation paid to an injured minor for lost wages and pensions is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.
Also, the compensation includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation equipment, the cost of adapting the home to the needs of the baby, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation was determined in each case for his body and according to his circumstances", says lawyer Reif-Ligenza. She adds that "today most medical malpractice claims end in a settlement that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in the management of the procedure", but she added that "there are cases where the procedure ends only in a judgment, which then if the claim is not rejected, the claimants will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example, in a lawsuit conducted by our office, the district court ruled for a minor who suffered a cerebral palsy due to a delay in seeing a distress settlement. The compensation exceeds ten million shekels".
In conclusion
Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.
In these cases, a proper judicial review of the chain of events that led to the tragic outcome, by a lawyer trained in handling medical malpractice claims, can help you get the compensation you deserve.
That's why the prevalence of Keratoconus eye disease in the South
• A study has suggested that there is a link between the development of the disease and consanguineous marriage
The highest prevalence was found in the Bedouin sector
Expert: "It may be that in any sector with a lot of cousin marriages, there is a high incidence of the disease".
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairment.
It's very important to diagnose it early, and find the right solutions to prevent it from getting worse.
In recent years, some studies have been conducted to help understand how the disease develops, and new treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide a scientific basis for suspecting that Keratoconus eye disease is a genetic disease.
A recent study that looked at the shape of the cornea from dome to cone found that the cause of corneal disease and weakness and deformation is related to an enzyme imbalance, where free radicals can damage proteins in the cornea - and its structure changes.
The source of that enzyme deficiency is genetic, a fact that supports the hypothesis that keratoconus is an inherited disease.
According to Prof. Ariella Gordon-Shag, head of the Department of Optometry Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, "In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, the prevalence of keratoconus was found to be 3.2%.
The highest prevalence was among students from the Bedouin sect - 20% had karatokonos, but there was a relatively small sample".
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: "Cartoconus is very common in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that consanguineous marriages are a risk factor for cartoconus.
So in any sector with a lot of cousin marriages, you might find a high incidence".
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unambiguous conclusion: in cases where there is a family history of cartoconus disease, all family members should undergo an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.
According to Erza Procter, a clinical optometrist B.Sc., "there is ten times more clinic turnover from remote peripheral areas, mainly from the south, compared to the center".
Procter adds that "in the last decade I have noticed that most patients are moving from the periphery, especially from the Beersheba area.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of inter-family marriage (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and lack of awareness of proper treatment of the problem".
So how do you diagnose the disease?
Procter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or late teens (ages 16-15, or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, parallel to an increase in the cylinder.
Cartoconus patients have distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and bones.
These signs get worse with the progression of the disease, which often develops slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease may also progress rapidly and reach a peak in just a few months.
Many patients even report increased sensitivity to light.
About three years after the Gaza operation, the IDF revealed the name of General M'Bent: "Now, the people know the face of a hero of Israel"
Mahmoud Khair-e-Din from Khurfis village is a lieutenant colonel who was killed in action in Khan Yunis.
Head of the UN: "He, his family and his children deserve publicity"
Next, we'll consider the possibility of publishing a photo of Colonel Emmanuel Moreno from a patrol of the General Staff.
Three and a half years after the operation that got bogged down in Khan Younis, the IDF today announces that the officer killed in the operation, Corporal M, is Corporal Mahmoud Khair A. Din, Jr. from the village of Khorefis in the north.
41 years old was in his fall.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "It has been three and a half years since Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Khir al-Din Zillal fell in battle in a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and devotion to the security of the state.
"Mahmoud Zell was a paratrooper and later rose through the ranks to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF Special Operations Command.
A hero of Israel who was posthumously awarded the title of "Commander-in-Chief".
He also said: "I saved him in his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, his name and the face of the hero of Israel, Lieutenant General Mahmoud Hair El-Din, openly.
The environment took its eyes off him.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion by the head of the intelligence branch, Major Aaron Haliwa, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, hero of Israel, was born on 28 December 1977 in the village of Khorfis in the Upper Galilee, the first son of his parents Ahmad and a nun, and has seven brothers and sisters.
He's the Druid witness.
Married to Nahad and father of two sons.
He served as an officer, a combatant and a commander in the Special Operations Branch of the Intelligence Division.
All his life, Khair-e-Din was a social leader, and the community looked up to him.
He attended school in Khorefis village until the tenth grade, and then went to the military boarding school at the Royal School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he joined the paratroopers, and in 2000 he graduated from the officers' school.
In 2002, he was identified by the Special Operations Command and transferred to the National Guard.
During his service he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Administration and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002, he met his wife, Naheed, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, during which time he and his friends founded a foundation that works to advance the Druze witness status in Israel.
In 2010 he joined the "After Me" association and began to coach a group in the village of Khorepis, after making sure that his association started to work in the Druze villages to encourage young men to enlist.
In 2013 his second son was born.
The head of the MNA, Colonel Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "This time we turn to the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din, a hero of Israel.
We've completed a work-up and concluded there's no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.
He deserves it, his family and his children", he said.
"Exceptional Educator and Leader"
"For many deeds he is no less a hero in my eyes", said the champion of Haliwa.
"He has made a significant contribution, which has courage and coolness, to the State of Israel.
He deserves to be put in his rightful place".
And he added, "I didn't know him personally, but he was an extraordinary educator, educator and leader -- not just in terms of his operations, but also in terms of my values".
Major Haliwa stated that he would also consider publishing the photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno of the 1st Infantry Division, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not allowed to be published.
The operation in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of meticulous preparation by the intelligence community.
The command staff of the operation was headed by the then Chief of Staff, Colonel Gadi Isenkot, the head of the M.M.N. at the time, Major General Tamir Hayman and the head of the General Staff at the time, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not been made public, and the IDF has stressed that this is an operation that the intelligence will not be held accountable for.
But the Arab media has been featuring in detail communications equipment that the Palestinians say was left behind by the forces behind.
Hamas claims the operation was a wiretapping operation.
According to public records, the day of the incident, the force was traveling in two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint set up by Hamas operatives, and something about their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its occupants.
The field interrogation lasted about 45 minutes, during which time she became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized it was in trouble, Colonel Khair al-Din managed to distract the Hamas men, and in a split second, the commander of the force, Colonel A, opened fire.
The fire killed three Hamas members, and sadly, Colonel Khair al-Din.
Ten months after the harrowing incident, the Chief of Staff, RAAL Aviv Khebi, decided to accept the recommendation of the SLA Committee and award the SLA Chief of Staff to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Strip - including Lt. Col. Khair al-Din, Jr.
The commander of the fighting force and another member of the crew also received a medal.
The Army announcement said then that Lt. Col. M received the Cross for "his actions in the operation with his squadron, in enemy territory, with determination, courage and courage, to protect his comrades.
He subsequently acted with initiative and undermined contact, taking a leading role in the capture of the enemy and working diligently to advance the capture.
Consider moving from a small operation to a large operation.
Israel should ask itself, again, whether it is wrong to change policy in the face of the Jenin decision.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set the West Bank on fire in its wake, but Jenin's gunmen may not have left her any choice.
This stormy weekend has taught us that even though Ramadan is behind us, the ground is still exploding.
It will take much effort and common sense to make it safely through the next two commemorations: Nakba Day today (Sunday) and Jerusalem Day two weeks from now.
There are a number of factors that will oppose an attempt to bring Trapp back to sanity.
At the head of the group, as always, are the terrorists, who are making a special effort to maintain the atmosphere of violence of the past few weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the previous day was killed a fighter of the IDF, R.S.V. Nemam Rez Zl.
Fighters who fought in the battle of Jenin testified that they could not recall such a scale of shooting and violence - a testimony not only to the sheer amount of M.I.T. in the area, but also to the willingness to use it.
It forces Israel to ask itself, again, whether it is right to change policy in the face of the Jenin crackdown, and move from small, intelligence-based Finza operations to a large, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel avoided doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and subsequently set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena; even now, the security establishment prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid arson, but Jenin's gunmen may not leave it any choice.
Draw lessons for future events.
Rez's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims that she deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shirin Abu Akala.
Operations are dangerous for those who participate in them and for those who are present.
The IDF takes enormous risks for its forces to avoid as much harm as possible to the innocent, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of combatants.
This is a sign of high ethics, but it also has operational intelligence value: a terrorist captured alive - as happened the other day in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about terrorism, attacks and other terrorists; it is information that cannot be obtained in any other way, and with it it it is possible to thwart future attacks.
The IDF was right to publish the interim report on the death of Abu Akala the day before, and to make it clear that it was not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful that a definitive bottom line can be reached in the matter.
It seems that nothing will convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without having to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terror - the original reason why the IDF is constantly operating in Jenin.
As always, the nature of such stories is to die.
World public opinion is engaged in her and continues, certainly as Ukraine continues to be fought with a more intense intensity.
So it's a shame that Israel insisted on giving the Abu Aqalah death case more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu-Akhla's family did not agree with the early conclusions, one should have expected a little more eloquence from the policemen accompanying the funeral procession, and certainly less excitement from the Palestinian flags being flown.
Responsibility requires: acting to calm the situation.
It was good that the Minister of Homeland Security and the Chief of Police ordered an investigation into the incident.
It seems to lack adequate preparation and clear guidance, but what's troubling is that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short period of time, and in two different counties.
Also in the Dizengoff attack, the police failed to manage the event, to isolate the scene and to handle the media.
The committee would do well to not only analyze the conduct of the officers at the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions that will allow for more successful handling of similar incidents in the future.
Along with the internal police care, it also undertakes to give an opinion on the conduct of elected officials who have lost their way.
The Israeli Knesset currently has several members who are considered a danger to democracy.
They're on the left and the right, and they're using their immunity not to challenge the country, but to harm it.
The most recent example is the case of Haqqani Ofer Qasif; if no action is taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the state will in effect encourage the next elected official to further police his actions.
Such moves, which are in the spirit of a defensive democracy, are essential in the explosions of this period, when in the background there are elements who want to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with a sense of decency is expected to rise above all of this and work to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel may quickly slip into escalation in the face of enemies from outside, and worse - enemies from within.
Senior police officer: "This requires government policy and targeting"
The Israeli police have launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal immigrants, but there is still a long way to go.
There is no single factor in the State of Israel today that encompasses this whole issue".
"If we want to address the phenomenon of illegal aliens, we need government policy, and from that we need to define goals, tasks and responsibilities.
Today, there is no single factor in the State of Israel that encompasses all of this", a senior police official told Israel Today.
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation of the security situation, the phenomenon was manifested in 20 to 30 thousand prisoners who entered daily through the breaches in the fence.
In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel daily to work through 34 controlled crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each branch is limited to the amount determined by the diplomatic rank according to the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
Permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Department.
In light of this, a hospital is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is banned due to criminal involvement or connection to attacks, but in many cases it is a Palestinian whose entry is banned because they do not meet the permitted amount.
It should be emphasized that the perpetrators of the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Balad were considered to be unarmed, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offence that required the security forces to monitor their movements.
"Therefore, it makes no sense for them to enter through the breaches in the fence", says a senior security official, "whoever wants to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled crossings, and there have been such cases in the past.
Thousands of Arrests
Following the attack in Alad and in light of the multiple attacks, the police have launched a large-scale operation to find illegal immigrants.
By the end of the week, 16,000 workers had been arrested.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and prosecuted, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the police prosecution policy, the proceedings against illegal residence are only carried out against would-be criminals or people who repeat the act repeatedly (recidivists).
An illegal stay that was first apprehended is investigated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes it happens a second time, but it's not until the third time that he's arrested, jailed, and charged with being illegal.
By law, if an illegal stay is detected within 50 to 100 yards of either side of the separation fence, it is handled by the military prosecution.
Data obtained by Israel Today shows that in 2021, 40,010 illegal residents, travelers and migrants were dealt with by the police.
7,405 illegal residents were arrested and 19,533 criminal cases were opened.
The number of employers, drivers and passengers treated by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
"The foundations of the S.H.I.E.L.D. phenomenon do not depend on the police, the IDF, Israeli society or Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors", says a senior law enforcement official.
"To address this phenomenon, we must discourage them from working in Israel, and the Israeli side must charge them a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.
The officials involved in the case allege that the non-reimbursement of the price is due, among other things, to the lack of places of detention and the fact that the arrests are made only when there are accompanying offences or when there is a serial killer.
Legal sources claim that the decision to charge a fee to the hospital only after his third arrest was made partly because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests made every day.
"Whoever examines the punishment also finds it not to be deterrent".
There's a great complexity.
"He's a complex man", says a police official.
He could be a family man who went to the country to work to earn a few shekels and come back.
This is the basic platform, and it's where all kinds of terrorists who come into the country to commit crimes or attacks are dressed".
A stroke can be major or minor.
In the past, 16-year-old illegal immigrants have been caught by the police, and even children between the ages of 8 and 10 have been sent by their parents to crossroads to earn a few shekels a day from customs.
"It also makes it complicated because in cases like this we have to bring in the parents and charge them with neglect", says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed garbage collectors, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 passages, there are about 18 major passages.
There are crossings for vehicles and goods, there are crossings that only people cross, and there are crossings that are both.
All the crossings are controlled by the IDF and the transit authority.
The U.S.A. is usually driven into the country by private drivers, so it's easy money.
"There are those who do it for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is to transport Jews", says a senior police officer, "usually mostly Arab Israelis, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can go from 100 shekels to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies don't do that, because if the company gets caught, it's doomed".
Police say that under certain circumstances, transporting a patient to a hospital can be considered a felony.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with the license and insurance, who collects Palestinians at regular points and at regular times, including ordered reservation, does not break the law", says a senior police officer, "who knows he is traveling from the hospital, usually collects them at night in hidden points, including unloading at hidden points.
Most of these guys drive a Chuck Meek car because they know they're gonna get their car impounded, so they'd rather drive an old car".
Documentary: Field fires in a bird's seat
The area suffers from many fires, with damage amounting to tens of thousands of shekels.
At this point, the New Guard was established in an attempt to stamp out the hard-core phenomenon of the "New Guard".
I know.
In the documentation obtained by Israel Today, grazing areas can be seen in the place of the burning birds.
The pasture lands are owned by Hime Zilberman.
The area suffers from many fires, with damage amounting to tens of thousands of shekels.
It should be noted that it was at this point that the New Guard was established in an attempt to stamp out the hard phenomenon.
This is when the alert goes off in your community.

Also, in the event of a true scenario, an additional alert will be activated and a true event will be reported to the rear command implementation.
Terrorists fired shells at IDF soldiers, who returned fire, killing one of them.
Security forces arrested 13 wanted men across Judea and Samaria tonight.
During the operation, an IDF force fired at several suspects who threw charges at them, a casualty was identified.
The director of the Jenin hospital that the terrorist was addressing, Maher Merai, 25 years old from Jenin, reports that he was shot by IDF fire.
IDF, KGB and MFA forces arrested 13 wanted men across Judea and Samaria last night.
The forces operated in several locations throughout the Judea and Samaria Governorate to arrest wanted persons, including in the village of Rashida and the town of Shamim.
In the fighters' activity in the city of Jenin in the area of the Manchu Air Division, two wanted suspects were arrested for terrorist activity.
In addition, during the operation, an IDF force fired at several suspects who threw charges at them, shooting sounds were heard in space.
We have a hit.
The director of the Jenin hospital that the terrorist approached, Maher Merai, 25, from the Jenin refugee camp, reports that he was shot by IDF fire, which led to his death.
During an operation by IDF soldiers in the Elazığ refugee camp in the area of the Space Division, a search for the arrest of a suspected terrorist and weapons seizure, several suspects were identified throwing stones at the force, which responded with means to disperse the demonstrations and fire Roger.
We have a hit.
In addition, arrests were also made in the village of Silwad east of Ramallah, as well as three students from the Qatlah al-Islamia, the Hamas-affiliated list at Anjash University in Naim, who were recently reported to have engaged in violent clashes with Fatah students and security forces on campus.
"Criminal investigation should be opened against her": City critic Heffa serious charges against the eye of a cliché
A city inspector's report presents an alleged fear of criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Klish Rotem against former city officials and political rivals: employee stalkers and an inflated payment to an accounting firm for conducting the investigations.
"The serious findings of the report warrant a criminal investigation".
There was no response from Haifa Municipality.
Tracking down city employees and political opponents and paying a hefty fee to an accounting firm to conduct the investigations, "at the expense of the public purse".
A report by Haifa Municipal Inspector Ofer Tal published yesterday (Tuesday), presents an apparent fear of criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Enat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
According to the suspect, Klish met with the accounting firm at Rabb and Co. and asked for an audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former city treasurer, and a code name given to the council company Sofi Naqsh, and we checked whether the tenders between the city and a company owned by Naqsh's family are fair to Hadrin.
The auditor's report also shows that there is a complete disorder and lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Clichy met.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose task is to centralize and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments and the data collected by the accountant was not transferred to him.
This has resulted in no one in the city being aware of all the projects that the accountant is doing, and what the amount of work is required in each of them.
Moreover, the hourly reports submitted by the accountant were not in many cases certified as required.
A situation was created where the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved was growing disproportionately, with great interference in the routine running of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring by the municipality.
In the report's conclusion, the audit recommended that the payments to the auditor be suspended until material detailing his work on each of the matters examined had been received.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were under codes such as "Border Guards", an information store, a fish store, an investigative review of the mayor and an investigative review report purchased.
Shortly thereafter, the city's tax collector, attorney Yimitz Klein, noted that the mayor had personally signed the payment authorization in her place.
"Not invited by any review report and I have no idea what it is", she wrote.
It was also learned that the cost of the investigation is about two million shekels of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remained to be paid, from the tax money of the general public.
Former city treasurer Jackie Wakim responded: "These nefarious acts done for the purpose of defaming elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the secret taxpayer are criminal offenses".
Sophie was struck by the city councilwoman's response: "The inspector's report and the commission's recommendations speak for themselves".
The testimony and the hard findings of the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the commission of the investigative review consultant to conduct investigations, which he doubted about some of them if they were legally permitted in the way they were carried out and in particular the investigations concerning the opposition council to the mayor and former senior employees.
The reaction of Lior Dutch from the "Borderguards" association: "It seems that all the red lines were crossed when a public authority sends private investigators to collect information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption and when it was appointed by the director of public proceedings against the Haifa Municipality".
The city of Haifa has not responded.
Judah Barlev's accounting firm would not comment.
Gantz revealed: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to undermine UNIFIL's activities in Lebanon"
The Minister of Defense attended the International Cyber Conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel knows the cyber systems of its rivals and their ways of operation".
Gantz referred to the documentation of al-Sayed in Hamas captivity as "a video that aims to blackmail  on the back of a humanitarian issue".
The deputy commander of the 8200 unit revealed, "We have foiled an attempt to poison the water systems".
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke this morning (Wednesday) at the International Cyber Conference of the Cyber Center at the University of Tehran where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on Lebanese civilians and the stability of the country", Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hisham al-Sayed, the Hamas captive in Gaza, who was released by the military arm of the terrorist organization: "Yesterday a video was published that aims to blackmail  on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four boys captive in violation of international law, in violation of morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and we expect the international community to act against this criminal behavior of Hamas".
He added that "the State of Israel is working with a variety of means, and continues to turn every stone in order to bring the boys home.
As we've said before, this is a humanitarian issue, that's how we see it, and that's how we're going to continue to act.
Blackmail attempts and mind-training will not affect our position and conduct".
He further revealed the joint activity of Iran and Hezbollah: "Iran is also activating its proxies in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today that recently an activity of the Iranian security agencies in cooperation with Hezbollah was detected, in order to harm the activities of the UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
That's by carrying out a cyber operation that was designed to steal materials from Unifil's space systems, and use them by Hezbollah.
This is another blow from Iran and Hezbollah to the Lebanese people, and to the stability of Lebanon".
"Israel knows the cyber systems of its adversaries and their ways of operating.
We have seen in recent years a phenomenon of Iranian hacker groups, operating against Israel and other countries", Gantz continued.
"The new shipments are terrorists with a keyboard that they use as fighters for other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we're hitting them and their messengers, and today they're still on our radar - and not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack on Israeli civilians will be on the agenda today.
And the responsibility is on the attackers and the state that funds and sends them.
A cyberattack can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and beyond".
Gantz continued in his attack on the nuclear power: "Iran leads cyber terrorism  and makes moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the US presidential election and other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Operations such as the Shahid Kava unit that collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries were carried out under the direct direction of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards as revealed in the investigations".
He added that "in recent years we have blocked many attempts to break into private and public companies, in the country and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber accountability' and to punish companies and bodies that do not act according to the guidelines".
Gantz went on to outline Israel's next goals in the face of threats: "Our top mission, in the military, in industry and in the various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have made this a priority for the relevant units.
We're looking at the power building all the time -- both in terms of manpower, both in terms of training and also in terms of mission.
In the coming years, we will also have to examine the way cyber warfare is organized, managed and operated, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system".
Finally, the Minister of Defense concluded and called for cooperation with the world: "There is great importance to our cooperation with the world against Iran also in the cyber dimension.
The same partnerships that we're building in the region with Iran in terms of defending against various threats -- we're expanding into the cyber dimension as well".
The deputy commander of the 8200 unit revealed, "We have foiled an attempt to poison the water systems".
Uri, the deputy commander of the 8200 unit, said in the unit's first public appearance at a conference of this kind, revealed that Israel had conceived an attack on the water systems.
"Defending against cyber threats is a core part of our business.
Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and act to disable his abilities", said the 8200 deputy commander, adding, "so sometimes we also find victims outside of Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and in collaboration with industry and other agencies, through the application and use of tools that we've developed.
The 8200 will not rest until the threat is removed".
As mentioned, this is how the threat to Israel's water systems and the attempts to poison Israeli citizens were exposed: "We thwarted the attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them a few years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a certain adversary had attacked Israel and in doing so, we identified that same attacker had also tried to target power plants in the United States.
That was the first indication of this attack.
We have been able to avert this threat by working closely with our American partners".
Watch: This is how the police are set up to eliminate terrorists in the civilian population
Jerusalem's Interior Ministry is training a new Assaf machine that simulates shooting in a crowded crowd in response to the series of attacks that have occurred in recent months.
The S.I.B. Counterterrorism Manual Envelops Jerusalem: "Development, gives a relevant response to the threats of the reference and simulates the reality on the ground"
A glimpse of the Assaf facility
Preparing for the Next Attack: A series of terrorist attacks in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, killing 19 people and injuring about 70 civilians, led the Border Patrol to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to storm terrorists within a civilian population and shoot at traffic.
Israel Today exposure: A look at the Assaf facility
Popular terrorism focuses on the harm to civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary for the normal conduct of civilian life.
The wave of violent attacks this year, with attacks in Bar Sheva, Bahdarah, Beni Barak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that took place in early April on Dizengoff Hussain Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who was embedded in the crowd, led the police to think creatively about the need to develop a tool that could be used to train fighters to attack terrorists within a civilian population.
The thinking was led by the police and border guard training wing.
These were put into a competition in the various police districts under the title "Leading Commanders to Learn", in which each district was required to develop tools that would help improve the policing and combat skills of the combatants, the police and the commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need for the training of MGB fighters to fight in the training of shooting in motion and descriptions of this kind, Assaf Ben David, a terrorist combat instructor of the MGB Jerusalem Envelope developed the "Assaf device", consisting of a dynamic target, which is connected to a telescopic pole on which consists of a carrier that can be attached to the instructor.
Their servant, who guides the bearer of our death, can train the warrior before him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It will be noted that in recent years, Border Guard fighters have faced numerous attacks in which the attacker, shooting and posing a threat while moving in the areas burned by innocent civilians.
"A collection facility", in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the upgraded telescopic pole that's being integrated into the facility was taken out of maintenance and cleaning.
The device allows the simulator to fire in motion within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the target, handling traffic stop, selecting a path of progress, and executing selective fire including the practice of avoiding injury to non-involved.
R.S.B. Asaf Ben David, after whom the facility is named, says: "The facility we have developed is a breakthrough in the training and education of soldiers and police.
The development, gives a relevant response to the threats of the allocation and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefits of development versus the relatively low cost of production give us a significant competitive advantage".
State comptroller warns: "Central Election Commission is not prepared for cyber threats"
Mattanjau Engelman warned at International Cyber Week of Israel's lack of readiness for cyberattacks
"World War III will be a hacker war but the world is not ready for it".
State visitor Mattanyahu Engelman attended the annual cyber conference of Tel Aviv University today (Wednesday) and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
We are exposed.
Our data is exposed to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it".
Engelman said that significant flaws were found in the cyber audits conducted by his office: "In the past year, we have conducted penetration checks in the traffic management center in Jerusalem, in hospitals and in the systems of the tax authority.
We found significant deficiencies in the audits, including the fact that very few penetration tests were conducted by public bodies and some of them only conducted penetration tests during the audit.
In addition, deficiencies in the Central Election Commission's preparedness for cyber threats have increased".
"We in the State Comptroller's Office are committed to continue to address this significant issue more effectively, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world", he concluded.
High aim: "I actually came to Jerusalem to earn my degrees"
Choosing red: "I was shown that I was wanted from the very beginning, I was built to lead a large group" •
Return to Israel national team after four years: "I felt I had a place, want to be in the EuroBasket team" •
• "I have learned to focus on what I can control".
Oz Blazer is on the air.
Oz Blazer will leave today with the Israel national team players to Poland, where they will meet the local team in the 2023 World Cup qualifiers (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the team will host Estonia in the full group stage.
In parallel with his intensive training with the national team, Blazer has been busy this past week with his future, until he signed a two-year deal with Jerusalem.
"I have a calm head now that I've found a team", he tells Israel Today in his first exclusive interview since signing.
"I'm a little stressed out now because I have to move in with my family after we settled downtown and it's not easy, but there are no more phones and professionally I'm much more relaxed".
You haven't been on the team in four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to enjoy the team and I come with the attitude of contributing everything I can, whether it's from my experience or whether it's on the field.
Of course I'd love to play, but when it comes to the team, everyone has to put their egos aside and do whatever it takes to make the team succeed.
I'm here for what they need me for".
Now you're 14 players, and the European Championship will see the addition of Danny Abadia, Gaby Chachasvili returning, and there may be some other changes as well.
You set a goal to be on the championship team?
"I'd love to be on the field and contribute".
Blazer, 29, has spent the last two years with the Texas Rangers.
When the season ended, it was clear he wouldn't continue in yellow and after a few weeks he moved to beer, preferring the Jerusalemites to the sickly worker.
You had other offers, why did you choose the Jerusalem verb?
"They showed a very great willingness for me to be there, so it was a relatively easy negotiation.
Once I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I knew this was the place for me.
The situation seems good and appropriate to me, too.
I'm here to lead and be a meaningful part of the team.
I talked to the coach and he has a hard-working, winning mentality, and that's exactly what I'm bringing.
I always loved playing in the arena, because I get energy even with the crowd against me, and now that they're on my side it'll be even better.
I'm sure it's going to be a fun, committed group, and I wanted to be a part of it".
Explain a little bit about your conversation with Coach DeJiccic.
"Professionally he believes in a lot of no-ball movement, he plans to bring good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energy in defence and attack and with the crowd in the arena it can work".
I've looked at your career and I've seen that every team stays at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel that you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
"Everywhere I go, I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
Since I signed up in Jerusalem, my phone hasn't stopped ringing and buzzing.
I got a lot of messages waiting for me.
So I believe we have a good time ahead of us".
Do you think Jerusalem could be a more significant player than the TSA?
How do you sum up your two years in the TSA?
"I'm afraid there were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I stayed professional all the way, and no matter how much I got, I always gave it my all.
I'm proud of the way I did last year, and now everybody's going their own way".
If it were up to you, would you want to stay in Macbay?
"After the last year it was clear to both sides that we were heading towards a break-up, but that's part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I got a little bit hurt in the minutes and my standing dropped, although I had a great mid-season, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized it was less of a place for me.
Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it".
To conclude, what are your goals for the coming season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the Cup semi-finals last season when I shouted to the Betts [team manager in the THA-YAM] 'That's why I'm here, so that's why I came to Jerusalem  to take degrees.'
Wade Baldwin may be joining the T.A.A.

The Reds are interested in signing the 27-year-old forward if he is released from active duty.
• A man may be borrowed to the neighborhood of Miracle Zion
Jerusalem has decided not to exercise the option of Retin Obasuhen.
Tel Aviv operative is considering adding Adam Ariel if he's released from Jerusalem operative.
As a reminder, a few days ago we reported that the 27-year-old forward's future at the Jerusalem club is in doubt and the team may be able to exercise the option to terminate his contract when a final decision is made in the coming days.
Now it appears that if he does not continue in the brewery, the T.A. will try to sign him into their ranks.
In Jerusalem, the club's board decided not to exercise the option on Retin Obasuhen's contract for another season and announced his release from the team.
Meanwhile, guard Rez Adam may be loaned to Miracle Zion after asking to leave the Reds to get more playing time.

All or nothing: 1:1 between the verb Jerusalem and the verb Hadrama
Guy Hadid scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but managed to correct it with a draw after 10 minutes.
Subsequently, the link was removed in questionable red (74) •
Hadera also remained in the ten players following red to the duty of Ido Levi (87)
The professional team of the Jerusalem Evening Calculator (JEC) well know the number of strangers on the Teddy grass field, much more than once, it should be noted, and at some point they even discovered one less player (Gia Hadida was removed).
This time, to their delight, all was well, and the 1:1 they had won against the worker would not be taken away by the union court.
Before the red one absorbed the affection, he managed to conquer the goal himself and match to set up a precious point for the lion.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Hadid's private show began.
Flekoshchenko made a wide pass, and the connection went up and backed up and the ball stopped in his team's net.
0-1 to a room that enjoyed the self-portrait of the relationship.
Ten minutes after the self-portrait, Hathida managed to fix it and the giant LeBokovich caught wind and the connection this time leaked to the right and exposed network.
One on one, Betty.
In the 74th minute, Hachida also managed to score a second yellow and red, this time after sliding in the direction of Marmantini.
Daniel Bar-Nathan decided on a questionable red and sent the link straight to an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Nathan also sent Addo Levi in red and evened the match on the grass.
The Relief Department: A deer has defeated a wolf
60 to 85
Ariel Bethlehem's team has won its third straight, this time in a particularly impressive fashion.
Hoover and Sachman (15 K.C.A.) were outstanding
The recovery of the worker Eilat continues tonight with an impressive 60:85 victory over the worker Holon on the way to a 0: 3 seasonal balance in the meetings between the two.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel Bethlehem's team has already won three straight, and it's really only a surprise for those who haven't seen the game.
We haven't seen such a bad disease in a long time.
All this before the opening game against Shikesh in the Playoffs in the Champions League: only 60 points, first half no three and 11 percent to three in the whole game.
Bottom line, an unimpressive evening for all the team's players (except Murphy Manko, who shot all three of Cholon's triplets), including the safe stock Chris Johnson.
On the other hand, Eilat is in much better shape thanks to the pastors Huber and Joaquin Schuhmann.
The first one's back to his old self in the last period, and the second one's back to his old self, and the third one's back to his old self with a three-quarter basket.
Give them a chance: Israeli police officers saved Sporopulos
After losing the Derby and eight in a row in Europe, a defeat in the Clasico against Jerusalem would have ended the long affair between the TSA goalkeeper and the Greek coach.
So who does Janis have to send flowers to tonight?
• To his Israeli team, who were responsible for 42 critical points in the Arena
And also: why the Yellow Club should change its Americanization strategy, and take a living example from the model of Ariel Halammi's house in Eilat.
It's hard to remain cynical at the sight of the tearful eyes and the warm, strong hugs that Janis Speropoulos gave his players at the end of tonight's game at the Arena, especially in the face of her close-knit and confidential exchange with John DiVerto Ulmao, by whose hands he saved the Greek coach his job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after losing the Derby at home and eight in a row in Europe, to lose the Classico to Jerusalem and walk away with three victories in the table?
That would have ended the Israeli-Greek romance by tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, and actually, especially about urology.
First, the T.A. came in with a radical change in offensive and ball-handling habits.
The ball was moving with devotion, with a lot of movement and practice, and Scotty Wilbkin, in a spectacular way, left the focusing to Evans, who moved very little, mostly over blocks and out to shots.
Although he pitched very badly (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed to the defense, and most importantly, the Magpies suddenly looked like a team, and the other players pitched.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in their brains, the team went back to their old ways, and the attacks went back to the shelling and the bombing, and in the most critical attack, with a lead of 2 and 40 seconds to go, Scotty shoved himself into a half corner and threw Floater on one leg that almost lost the game.
The trick is to keep playing tricks and submission moves at the moment of clash, and that has to go into nature and the group DNA.
The important learning will be done by Yannis and the club about the use of Israelis.
The ones who became the water pumps and towel-wavers at the European Games.
Tonight they pitched for a coach who no longer believed in them for more than half the team's points (42 out of 83), and were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of the top five shooters in the squad were her Israelis.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can help in the Euroleague.
The first half was mostly Oz Blazer, who's been screaming for a month that he has to play more.
Shooter, morale, a fighter under the sails, seven rebounds, six feet of defensive determination and game-wise.
Isn't that enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen was in the lead, with excellent all-around percentages, a cool head from the line, and cover for the injury to Zjacic, and especially John D, who in 70:63 to Jerusalem changed the momentum with 5 straight points.
Liannis has a complicated relationship with Yeppe Zew, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and overcharges him, to the point of risking a loss.
It's happening in Urollig, and it happened tonight.
But the important lesson should be for the club, about its Americanization strategy.
Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to the Maccabi.
Tamar Ginneth and Sam Meder went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Nahum Debret is choosing Jerusalem, or perhaps rejected by Maccabi.
And it's happening because there are fewer and fewer Israeli spots in the Maccabi, because of the club's educated and rooted choice to rely on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play with her, then she will look for Jewish children to civilize, and she will pressure the director/union to increase the number of foreigners.
But this is a fatal mistake by the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that she overdoes it with strangers, much to the tax credit.
Of course, we're not saying that Israelis alone are enough, but they're good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same amount on one star plus eight mediocre ones, you could have five excellent ones.
For example, this season, with the money from Williams, Nunnally, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, we could have brought in two effective and consistent stars alongside Scottie and Zizzic.
It would be more effective, it would be more accurate, it would be more Israeli, it would be more beautiful and interesting and create identity.
It's true there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to rely on your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even receives tax breaks from the state for its pseudo-representation in Europe.
The basketball association/league manager can help Maccabi, and come to terms with a number of strangers adapted to the Israeli league.
Six brewsters, four on the form, maximum three on the field at a time.
Is it because of the continuing failure of the achievements (in Europe for seven years), just for the sake of the Maccabi, that the league is flooded with foreigners?
And the players' union, what about you?
Is that what you were working for?
There were two Israelis on the court, and now there's one?
Like George Costanza in the pilot of Seinfeld.
Negotiate for less?
The old Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for the Maccabi.
And if anyone needed a little bit of reinforcement, the deer guy came in early and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and 4 Israelis who were only second in the youth teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Rowena and Sukhman the Warrior), she broke the second place for the second time in the last two weeks.
It's a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was a run like that in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot of it in the days of Sharon Drucker.
The short-handed eagle is simply a more balanced and efficient group, and unlike Ariel Beit Helmi, who started out in the open courts at the Hill of Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their peak, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.
Foreigners only make up.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather come back from their knee injury, it's gonna be a great team.
A song I dreamed about a deer.
And that Shambhi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "It felt like the whole world was against us"
The yellow team is happy after the 78:83 on the active Jerusalem Arena: "We have returned to play as the THA Maccabi should play"
The conversation between the Bitons in the locker room, the first positive diagnosis of the ZZZH injury and the management's approval of the purchase.
A great sense of relief was recorded this morning among the people of the TSA after the important and prestigious 78:83 yesterday in the Arena on the Jerusalem square.
The players and the management team were hugging coach Yannis Skarpoulos who seemed very excited at the end.
Opening Z and the Laser team poured water on the game-winning Derrick Williams, and the rest of the club smiled with a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure had been released after the last losing streak.
They too feared defeat in the face of a great adversary that would further destabilize the system.
The fans also had a long time to celebrate in the stands.
"I have an amazing connection with Janis in the locker room", said Oz Blazer.
"We know it wasn't easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We've been looking forward to it, even the way we've been playing.
We're back playing the way the T.A.C. should play, with heart and fight, we're behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us".
Before the game, team manager Amy Bitton came into the locker room and said some exciting things to the players.
"His stuff had a big impact on how we went out and how we played on the court", players told Maccabi.
Despite the excitement, the Maccabi are already focused on the important game against Baskonia on Thursday and want to break the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us", Blazer added.
"We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the last few games we've been under a lot of pressure, and Yanis told us that if we were free, we'd win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
A lot of eyes on us and it was the feeling of the whole world against us, I'm proud to go into this war, we cut off everything around and look only at ourselves".
Aneta Zizicz, who injured her right knee during the final quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
The doctors will see how his knee is doing today and then figure out how many days of rest he'll need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Baskonia.
In addition to the strong backing provided by the management of the Spartakolos and the professional team, at a meeting held on Thursday, the professional manager Nikola Vičić was given the green light to bring one or two players to strengthen the team, and the yellow hopes to soon add a quality acquisition.
Anthony Bennett released from Jerusalem operation
The forward who was the first pick in the NBA draft has not been able to adapt to the team from the capital.
The club said goodbye: "Anthony has entered our hearts, thank him for the period in action".
About four months after signing the Jerusalem Act, Anthony Bennett was released from the group today.
The 28-year-old forward, who was selected first overall in the 2013 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaged 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games in the Championship and 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in the Premier League.
"The player Jerusalem and the player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a joint decision on the termination of the player's contract with the club", the club said, "Anthony is in our hearts and we want to thank him for his time in the player.
We wish him nothing but good luck".
Research says that zooming in on meetings hurts creativity.
Some 2,100 engineers and academics worldwide were asked to develop solutions to the problem  some in video conferences, some in face-to-face meetings •
The result: Virtual dating hurts creativity and thinking outside the box
The study's lead author, Columbia University, says that "visual focus on the screen impairs the process of generating ideas".
There's no impairment in productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature looked at the impact of video conferencing on participants' creativity, compared to face-to-face meetings.
Unfortunately, we've found that creativity is actually being hurt in virtual meetings through screens.
The question of the study -- led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University -- was whether remote computer meetings preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming meetings, or whether creativity and free thinking decline as a result of the distance.
The study itself started as early as 2016, but got a big boost in the two years of the coronavirus, when many workers moved to work from home.
"People in a face-to-face meeting move around the room, use objects, and are helped to think creatively", says Brooks.
"In a computer meeting, however, the focus on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative brain activity.
Visual focus on the screen is impairing cognition.
People are more focused on video when they're interacting, which hurts the broad, expansive idea-making process".
Space is shrinking.
To test the results and see if they would repeat themselves, they were tested twice -- once at Columbia University and once in real life -- on engineers who had known each other from early on.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts - one where the subjects were asked to meet in person and develop solutions to a problem, and the other where they were asked to do it via computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to split up similarly and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, there was a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher on ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
He thinks that in thinking, people often look at their environment to help generate ideas, whereas in video conferencing, thinking is focused on the screen and doesn't expand in a creative way.
"When people in the same room look around and see the space, there are objects and situations that can trigger new associations in them.
"In contrast, research shows that interacting with computers changes our attention so that we are more inward-looking and screen-focused, and this reduces innovation and idea generation through looking at the environment and thinking outward".
There's no harm in critical thinking.
However, before managers rush workers back to the office, the researchers note that "Computing did not impair productivity itself nor did it impair people's critical thinking about innovative proposals, where they had to pick the best idea from a set of ideas.
That is, the harm is focused on creativity alone and not on other forms of computer work".
Professor Ellen Langer, a psychology professor at Harvard University, also cites the findings.
She says, "There's a difference between just being creative, like new uses for Prisby, and working solutions.
It may also be that when employees are more relaxed after introductions, or when they work from home, creativity does improve".
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also proposed a future study in which such meetings would be reduced to thinking and wandering around the room to see how this activity would affect the end result.
Dr. Olson also suggested that following the study only brainstorming sessions would return employees to work and as a rule he suggested not to be alarmed by one study but to conduct another investigation in the field.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forced back and not be happy. That's a bigger insult", he says.
Musk awaits Trump's return: "It was wrong to block him"
The new buyer of Twitter said he would reverse the decision, which led to the blocking of the former US president's account.
"Think it was a mistake", he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter in a $44 billion deal, said Tuesday that he intends to bring Trump back to the social network, which had blocked him as president, after riots by his supporters on Capitol Hill following his election defeat by Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake", he said.
"If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and the suspension - the temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban", Musk clarified.
By 2050: the world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years
The Solution: Proper Management of Water
A disturbing new study recently published in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050, the amount of water available for agriculture will decline by about 80 percent if the rate of water consumption and population growth in the world remains at their current use trends.
In the study, which involved scientists from all the world's science agencies, scientists aggregated the total amount of rainwater, rivers and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The dismal findings of the study show that right now the rate of water consumption has been doubling repeatedly over the past 10 years, while global warming is causing reduced rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study, 84 percent of the world's arable land will experience severe rainwater shortages.
One of the key findings of the study calls on farmers around the world to adapt their farming to climate change and seasonal changes, and to switch to farming methods that take into account the water that enters the soil to avoid the evaporation process that leads to widespread waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater harvesting technologies to prevent rainwater from flowing into the sea.
Information about many students from Bar University has leaked online.
The hackers who attacked Bar Ilan University's database a few weeks ago threatened to release the information on the students if they did not receive a ransom.
The threat has been met and the information has been leaked all over the Internet.
Bar Ilan University students are under attack when their personal information is leaked across the web by a cyber-attacker known as Darkrypt who posted a ransom demand a few weeks ago from the university and threatened that if he is not paid an undisclosed amount of money, he will release the information under his control.
Estimates of the amount of money the attacker demanded are that it started at thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked, it went up and before the information was published it had already reached several million dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are filled with angry posts and chaos is celebrated there, with students unable to log into their personal information systems and unable to perform routine student tasks.
The university sent out an e-mail blast announcing the attack on the academic institution and that they were working intensively to mitigate the damage, detailing some of the information that had leaked online.
No specific instructions were given to those whose data was compromised, and it said that the university had taken a series of actions to strengthen the security of the university's servers.
Line to 40 communities: fiber optics reaches Benjamin
The trend of peripheral ownership of high-speed Internet continues and now fiber optic is reaching the Benjamin Council of 40 communities.
The project, a partnership between the council and telecom companies Telran, X-Fiber and Grenade Internet, will be launched immediately after the holidays.
Benjamin Council signed a broad agreement this weekend to install fiber optics in all council communities.
The agreement with NetFiber, a joint venture between Rimon, TeleRan and X-Fiber, was signed after a major tender process that the council had been working on for the past few months.
Work will begin after the holidays and residents from the council's 40 communities who are interested in connecting to the fiber optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 giga as well as an advanced home end-to-end that will allow for strong WIFI reception, as required at these times.
The subscribers will be able to choose between high-speed fiber-optic internet or high-speed fiber-optic filtered internet provided by the Internet Grenade.
The board has made sure that the market remains open to competition in all circumstances.
The head of the Binyamin Regional Council, Israel Gantz: "This is real Zionism.
That's great news for the residents.
The experience of living in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to study remotely if needed, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in communities that will have high-quality Internet and no delays.
I want to wish the good companies success in their community projects.
The people are waiting for you".
Gantz added: "We will soon have access to some of the best high-speed Internet in Israel.
We've worked for many months to lay the foundation for fiber installation and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank the Minister of Communications, Commissioner Hendel, who started the project with us in his previous term and now we are reaping the fruits of the labor, the staff of the Minister of Communications, the council members who were loyal to the center's members and the CEOs of the companies that won the center for professional quality from the best in Israel. "
Director of Internet Rimmon, Yerev Par: "I thank the mayor Israel Gantz and his team who immediately raised the glove to bring good news to the thousands of council residents who will switch to high-speed Internet that will improve the quality of life in the fields of education, economy and of course leisure".
Teleran Media Group CEO, Shi Eslan: "We are pleased with the decision of the Binyamin Council to connect to a fast and powerful Internet infrastructure and I am sure that thanks to the extensive experience of the group we will be able to give residents high-speed Internet just like in the center of the country".
X-Fiber CEO, Israel Elizor: "The establishment of communication infrastructure in Binyamin is the Zionism of the year 2021, X-Fiber is proud to take part in the establishment of the new infrastructure in the biblical areas of Binyamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with the Jewish areas in general and Binyamin in particular, we will meet the engineering challenge to bring high-speed Internet to every house across the council".

Many people who inject feel weak, hot and tired after receiving the injection, while others do not.
Could this indicate a stronger immune system in those who do experience these effects, or is this just a baseless rumor?
As more and more people are being screened, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are not true.
Are the immune systems of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies responded less severely to the vaccine, which might prove that their systems are unable to fight off an invading foreign body?
"There are several levels of vaccine reactions", says Dr. David Devere, head of the hospital's primary care unit and a member of the CDC (Covid-19 Disease Control and Prevention) Advisory Committee, and he reassures: "Headaches, fatigue, aching joints, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body responds to the entry of a foreign body into the system".
Is there a link between the levels of antibodies that develop and the side effects?
"There is no correlation between sensations and development of antibodies to the virus.
About 60 to 50 percent experience side effects, but about 90 percent develop immunity to the virus.
People who developed stronger responses were not found to be more protected".
"There is no correlation in the medical literature between immediate response and vaccine levels.
In some of the trials where people also got placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It's also a psychological component -- how a person perceives the vaccine, if they expect to have side effects.
Many of the cold events could have happened in a normal way, but because the public is immune, they attribute the response to the vaccine itself, and that's the bias we see with vaccines in general - attribution of cold events to and in proximity to the vaccine".
According to Dr. Devere, the causes of the reported side effects, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
When it comes to myocarditis, opinions are divided.
"There are all kinds of theories, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One theory is that it's a strong immune response".
Is there any way to assess the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, it showed that those who were sleep deprived or had higher blood pressure were more susceptible to infection.
Besides, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there's a decline in the immune system, you can see it right away.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone's walking around with a weakened immune system and doesn't know it.
These are people who come to the breweries because of recurrent episodes of infectious disease, and what affects the system are mundane things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
And by the way, we also don't want a too strong immune system, because it can cause autoimmune diseases".
MRNA vaccines will soon appear in other contexts, thanks to the wealth of knowledge that has been accumulated about them in recent times.
"will undoubtedly open the door to other vaccines of this type.
And this technology is being tested for a lot of uses beyond vaccines -- for cancer treatments, for example.
Their efficiency is that the material stays in the body for a very short time -- it enters, it does its job, and then it breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it's been given a major boost by the very high demand for a rapid vaccine.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week interval between doses is too small, and some immunization experts say that after a third dose, we may not need another vaccine in the near term, so it's not clear whether we're going to go to a half-yearly vaccination phase or whether the third dose will provide a larger interval".
Thousands affected: A serious privacy violation on Highway 6
- Customers on Route 6?
• Your personal information, including your full name, address, payment amount and full details of your travel arrangements, may be exposed
The Privacy Commissioner claims that the Eretz Road Company violated the Privacy Act and its regulations.
After a report that a company, the Israel Highway 6 operator, had been notified of a security incident that occurred at the company, the Privacy Protection Authority initiated an enforcement procedure.
During the event, a security vulnerability was discovered on its payment site, which allowed the disclosure of a large amount of information from the accounts of the member's customers, which were exposed to all eyes.
Among other things, the payment accounts of customers over a period of time were exposed and these accounts included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates and times.
Furthermore, since the company did not document access to its systems as required by law, it is not possible to know precisely for how long unauthorized parties could have accessed the company's systems.
In the letter of infringement, which the Privacy Authority forwarded to the company, the Authority emphasized that most companies and large organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that with the development of threats and risks, the organization has an obligation to carefully examine the updated risks and act in accordance with the update of the security measures accepted in the circumstances of the case, depending on the nature of the database and its quality.
As a result, companies and organizations are required to update their systems and conduct risk assessments and penetration tests to examine and assess changing risks.
Companies and organisations are also required to use an automated recording mechanism and to provide training to employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy (Information Security) Regulations.
In accordance with the findings of the audit, the Authority determined that the company had violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Act and its regulations and required the company to take a number of corrective actions.
"The matter has been handled in accordance with the strictest requirements".
Istanbul travel warning: Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change the destination or time of their flight.
Good news for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: Airlines will allow you to change flight dates.
Earlier this week, Counterterrorism Headquarters raised the severity of the Istanbul travel alert to four.
This is the highest level and it means "high threat level: do not enter this country and if you do, leave the country as soon as possible".
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus said they would allow Israelis who booked their flights before the travel warning went out, i.e. before June 13, 22, to change the destination or date of their flight.
It's a call to the airline.
Tourism Minister Rezabozov said: "Israeli citizens should not have to pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
I am glad that large airlines like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request and I hope that more companies will give a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey because of the severe travel warning".

Saudi skies are closing in: Israeli companies prepare to reinforce lines to the east
The resulting sum of expanded freedom of flight over Saudi Arabia: the airline is set to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of European destinations
Israel's largest airline is planning major changes ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we reported in Israel Today, the estimate is that Biden will announce that he will grant permission to Al Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the UAE.
The impending agreement means that you will be able to fly on shorter routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.
To do that, the company will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, in order to divert planes to new destinations.
The destinations that will be cancelled from November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations that have a sizable Jewish population, but at this point they're less profitable for society.
In contrast, the new destinations being considered in the report are Tokyo, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
Here's how it's gonna work: Dreamliners flying to Canada will be freed up for long-haul flights east.
Boeing 737s flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred to destinations such as London and Paris, where Al operates on Dreamliner flights.
So that the company can actually free up large planes to fly to other destinations in the East.
At the same time, Baal al-Arab expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to return to fly to Turkey, for which the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.
How much would you pay for a suitcase on any airline?
• The European Commission has published a guide to the various airlines' fares.
Who offers 6 euros for an extra 10 kilos, and where does the price never include luggage?
Prices have changed, the terms of service are no longer the same and many Israelis are surprised when they arrive at the airport and find they have to add large sums for luggage that they thought was included in the price.
How do you know what the airline's terms of service are?
That's what we're here for.
Lufthansa Group (Swiss, Austrian and Lufthansa)  The light ticket includes hand luggage only, if you want to add a suitcase, you have to do it seven days in advance via the website at a cost of 70 dollars one way, on the phone it will cost you 80 dollars and at the airport 100 dollars.
In the higher class there is a included luggage of up to 23 kilos, and in the economy premium you can take two suitcases.
American Airlines is offering passengers to New York and Miami a 75-pound bag and a trolley case.

Of course, we can add a troll.
The basic ticket price includes a handbag that is no larger than 55*20*40 and weighs up to 7 kilograms.
A suitcase weighing up to 20 kilos will cost $40 one way with advance reservation.
At the airport, the fare will be $90 for a one-way trip.

Lowcoast Wise Air allows passengers who have purchased a basic ticket to board the plane with a backpack only.
If you want to add extra prestige, the price varies depending on the type of ticket you buy and the destination, and can reach several hundred shekels per suitcase (150-290 toward), depending on the weight of the suitcase you choose.
Easyjet allows you to carry a small bag, 45x36x20, provided it fits under the seat.
Beyond that, on the basic card you'll have to pay for an extra compliment.
Those who order a seat with more legroom can bring a large bag measuring 56 by 45 by 25.
The price of an upgrade to a preferred seat that also buys more dignity varies between flights.
Ryanair's honorary policy is the most complex, starting with a basic personal briefcase that can go under a seat for free.
If you want to add more, you can start at 6 euros one way, provided that your total weight is no more than 10 kilograms, and from there prices can skyrocket and can reach hundreds of shekels one way, depending on the type of weight you choose and the ticket you buy.
On the El Al Light card, you'll be eligible for a hand-me-down of up to 20 pounds.
If you purchase a Classic ticket, you'll also be entitled to a large suitcase that will be sent to the belly of the plane.
Booking an extra suitcase can cost between $90 and $150 a way if you do it at the airport, with advance booking being a little cheaper.
Exempt from quarantine for vaccinated and recovered from non-red countries, foreign tourists are returning.
The people in the country have received messages from the Ministry of Health that they are exempt from the obligation to isolate with a negative test result.
Only after that did the office issue an official statement that it was only about passengers from orange countries, although returnees from red countries also reported receiving the message.
In addition, tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
At the height of the epidemic - the end of quarantine for returnees from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent this morning (Monday) messages to the returnees, saying they are exempt from isolation with a negative result to the corona test they performed after landing in Israel.
It's also about the red states.
Some of the messages sent informed returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative response or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving the negative response.
Only after that, official announcements from the Ministry of Health were issued stating that starting from midnight, 4.1.2022, vaccinated or recovering, returnees from orange countries will undergo a PCR test at the National Institute of Gastroenterology and be isolated for 24 hours or until a negative result is received (whichever is earlier).
The decision will be sealed in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be submitted to the Knesset Health Committee for approval.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovered people who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they performed upon entering Israel, will end their isolation at midnight and are not obliged to perform a second test.
However, passengers from red states reported that they too had received the message.
Those who have not been vaccinated or recovered and returned from an orange country will be placed in home isolation for 14 days, with the option of shortening the isolation with a negative result in a pcr test performed from the 7th day of landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to lift most restrictions on flights and especially on vaccinated people comes a day before the hearing in the High Court filed by the Association of Ministries of Travel, the Open Skies Headquarters and the Hotel Association.
At tomorrow's hearing, the petitioners are expected to demand that all other countries be removed from the red list, with Professor Itamar Grotto backing them in his opinion.
Even strangers can come in.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transport agreed that starting Sunday 9.1.2022, vaccinated/recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) from orange countries will be allowed to enter - subject to the completion of an online form in advance, the performance of a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, the performance of a PCR test on entry to Israel and subsequent entry into quarantine for 24 hours or receiving a negative test result (whichever comes first).
Foreigners who are not vaccinated/not cured (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, except those whose entry has been approved by the Committee of Exceptions, will not be allowed into Israel.
The group outline will not be revised at this time.
What about the red countries?
The Committee on Country Classification in the Ministry of Health recommends the government to remove from the red list of countries and move to the orange list of countries: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain at this stage on the red list are the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option being considered by the health department is to exempt vaccinated people returning from red states from quarantine.
It's unclear at this time if there's any connection between the messages received this morning by the returnees to Israel and the instructions that may be received at the Ministry of Health on this matter.
The Ministry of Health has yet to respond.
The skies are opening up: the Ministry of Health changes the restrictions on the Earth gates
Vaccinated returnees from orange countries will be required to undergo 24-hour isolation.
The United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates will be marked in red.
After weeks of finding it very difficult to fly to a destination without restrictions, and after all returnees from abroad were required to quarantine, along with a ban on tourists entering Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on the NAFTA.
The Ministry of Health has decided to recommend lifting the three-day quarantine requirement for Israelis returning from orange countries.
So far, anyone who's vaccinated or recovered as defined by the Ministry of Health who's returned from an orange country is required to self-isolate for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Vaccinated and recovered people returning from orange countries will now be required to self-isolate for a maximum of 24 hours, or until they receive the results of post-landing coronavirus tests at the NBBG (whichever is earlier).
Anyone not determined to be immunized or cured will still be required to enter a seven-day quarantine subject to two coronavirus tests, or 14 days without the second test, whether returning from an orange country or returning from a red country.
Immunized or recovered returnees from a red state must also be in full quarantine.
The latest red list of countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs government approval, includes the United States, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries except Turkey, the average positive inflow in the last two weeks is more than 5 percent of the total, which automatically puts them on the red list.
Turkey's rapid rate of increase, with a positive rate of just over 4 percent, has been added to the red list.
The most prominent countries to be removed from the red list are France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, starting January 9, tourists who are vaccinated according to the Ministry of Health's requirements will be able to enter Israel without the need for quarantine, and under similar conditions to Israelis returning from an orange country.
Again, the decision is subject to government approval, which will be discussed in the coming days.
It's important to note that there are very few instances where the government does not endorse the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
The tourists are against the restrictions.
The union of travel agencies, the Open Skies HQ and the Hotel Association have petitioned the Supreme Court to lift the restrictions on the flights.
The country lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but as noted, it left eight significant countries on the red list.
At a hearing in Jerusalem this morning, the petitioners are expected to ask the country to remove the red list.
The one who will support the petitioners' position is Professor Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yoel Razzabozov, who has supported in recent weeks the easing of restrictions on the entry of foreign tourists to Israel, said yesterday: "The lifting of the quarantine for vaccinated returnees from abroad and the return of tourism for vaccinated people is the right and just thing to do at this time.
I thank my friends in government, who understand the plight of the tourism industry and agree with me that the harm outweighs the good.
The vaccine is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to lead a life that allows them to live alongside the corona".
With an investment of 200 million NIS, the new resort to be opened near Arad
Desert is flourishing: Another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years
Chef restaurants, private pools, and 110 rooms are just a small part of what the hotel has to offer.
All the details in the article
7MINDS, a company from Beit Fathal, and the real estate company White City Buildings, have jointly purchased a plot of land covering about 20 acres in the Judean Desert, where they will establish a luxury resort with an investment of about NIS 200 million. The hotel will be built on the same land where a former hotel was built that was demolished about a year ago.
The resort won't open for another three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three communal pools, a spa, chef restaurants, a leisure complex, a gym and more.
The one who will be in charge of the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ren Shmuel from the Claro Restaurant.
Chef Shmuel will be the one to build the menu that is expected to have a desert concept unique to the resort.
The mayor of Arad, lawyer Nisan Ben Hammo, congratulated the project: "The decision to build a new luxury hotel near Arad gives the official seal to the amazing princess that Arad has made in the field of tourism in recent years.
I am proud of the choice of the entrepreneurs and convinced that it will be a joint success as we will exploit the enormous tourist potential".
All on display: flights to all of Europe starting at $78
• The skies are opening up and airlines are taking on operations not seen in a long time
Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Budapest, Berlin, Amsterdam and other destinations for less than $100 round trip
I know.
Israel's largest airline is reporting an increase in demand for international flights since yesterday's announcement of significant easing of restrictions on flights.
The company has decided to announce a special promotion for the opening of the skies this morning and the prices it offers are considered particularly attractive.
Under the new operation, the company offers flights to Berlin, Budapest, Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Athens, Amsterdam, Lisbon and other destinations at prices starting at $60 for round-trip flights.
Following the relief on flights, the airline is resuming flights to a number of destinations including Canada, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Belgium and more.
It's important to remember that this is a limited number of tickets (about 4,000) and the price does not include the honorarium and the choice of seat.
The operation is valid for bookings made today and tomorrow and flights that take off until January 31, 2022.
As of midnight tonight, France, Spain, Portugal and more countries will be removed from the red list.
The United States, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and five other countries are still on the red list and there is a no-fly zone without an E.R.C. approval.
Almost everyone these days has an old tablet or smartphone lying around in a useless closet.
Just because a slightly newer, more sophisticated model has come out, any device can be a Spotify player in the hotspot connection.
Old devices can be traffic cameras, remote controls for home appliances and a whole host of other uses.
We don't have to be victims of consumer culture and we don't have to be always at the forefront of technology, with another really useless gadget.
Gathering data without analysis.
That's too bad.
It was more interesting to hear how many people received benefits at the Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the desirable city centers) is worth, and how much the employees' wages (minimum).
Israel Post is not to be privatized.
The question is how many packages have been delivered and how many have been distributed?
Because how many blinds them
They order packages, and they disappear at the Intelligence Emergency Center...
There should be a package tax of 5 shekels, so they don't just order some stupid weight and charge it to the post office.
It's mostly a reflection of the cost of living in the country.
Thank you to the King of Packs for making it so much better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and we try not to go near the post office and hope that no letters come from them and hating the post office has led us to give up everything that pertains to the possibility of a post office.
Have a good week.
Fire all the postal workers, and start rebuilding the post office by a private company.
Big-headed employers and some racists!
They talk differently on the phone, and when they come in for an interview, their true colors are revealed.
No wonder they can't find any workers.

Much more suitable than Willowkin for the machetes you built.
You can see there are professionals in the Blat and Katz prisons.
Maybe personality still matches Scottish but team player and mainly game intelligence much higher.
So sad that the Tel Aviv MKV relies on foreigners and the Israelis are warming the bench.
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes, not a collection of foreigners, so they wouldn't have succeeded with all the stars scratching from around the world.
Who cares about that?
If you're watching a game where 6 American players and 3 Israeli players are decorating, wouldn't you rather watch the Golden State game????

Good luck to you.
Good one.
I did.
As for the Israelis, he is absolutely right!!
And the comment about Ziva -- we saw last season that he's a good player who can also lead a team.
So in Euroleague he can't be a leader, but his decline in ability also in the league indicates that he has lost confidence (which is not surprising after the treatment he received after 2 bad games in Euroleague, as if foreigners did not have such games) and its use may also be wrong, and it is the result of the coach's persistence and patience.
A non-bullet laser with all due respect...
Ya'abul Ziyo shouldn't be in the Tel Aviv police. He's taking her out of my hands.
Once there was no good game but Sorkin and Blazer Uncle and also Cohen today all respect.
He's a lazy, loyal, loyalist who's been given 500 shekels so he writes nonsense.
That's not Pederman.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jake Cohen are much better than Colliaro and Taylor who in Europe play for 20 minutes and can't score a basket, who needs foreigners at the level of nothing and nothing, much better that the Israelis play.
Good to have a good spirit for everyone. Coach, players and management at the Momentum Workshop.

How do you know what's gonna happen in 30 years?
Someone here missed an important detail.
Scientists don't care about warming or rain.
They're only interested in the rate of population growth.
They're working on more and more vaccines and more and more ways of killing off the world's population, so they tell us fake stories about global warming and other bullshit they make up.
There's no problem with pouring water, in unlimited quantities
They said that 50 years ago.
Meanwhile, there are more people.
The solution is birth control, especially in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the other anti-state leftists, and in all religions that believe in gods -- the stupid, the ignorant, the lazy, the blind, or in short -- the herd.
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living things (also called sesmolin) consume oxygen and emit carbon dioxide.
The solution: Smolans, kill yourselves!
It's green.
Good for the world.
May you be better, and may the Earth and all of us be safe.
Who are the scientists and how did they do the research?
I don't believe any research that talks about global warming because that thing doesn't exist.
He's bent on controlling us, taking away our freedoms and our freedom.
It's all part of the new world order.
And journalists like Assaf Golan are on their side as they did during Corona.
I've never heard him present facts from either side. He always brings up the side that serves the globalists.
We are haunted.
Just burning money on academic research.
As usual, another snippet from the psychopathic Sesmolin snippet land.
Human knowledge is expanding, and with it new and improved technologies.
For centuries, the world's population has been growing steadily at an exponential rate, and things are only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, have embarked on a massive war project in the Gobi Desert, with astonishing success.
The Saudis are doing the same thing and they're succeeding too (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It's the stupid climate crisis of the esomolenes that's making the Sahara greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the esomolene agenda, so you won't read about it in the papers...
The left doesn't care.
They have urine coming straight up their heads so they don't dry out.
Does proper management of water resources mean a reduction of at least 70% of the world's population?
It's amazing that COVID is coming and it's amazing that most of the population is being injected with experimental material whose 5-25 year-long effects on those injected are completely unknown.
It's amazing that Agenda 2030 is getting underway and now this?
It's really confusing the whole thing!!!
What a load of bullshit.
The stories of a thousand nights and nights, all the cowardice and of course the nonsense of the left trying to control the world through media control, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years.
They say that it never rains in the country and the drought is constant and here it is raining.
They also said that Rabin didn't murder Jews in Altadena and that Perse didn't know that octopus children were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, was not an antiquarian and Weizmann's assistant was not messing with his troops.
It's clear that you're promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
That is disgusting bullshit.
They'll also have to take care of the reception in the circuits, handle the blackouts and the voltage drops.
"This is real Zionism" like opening a Remy Levy branch in Jerusalem is Zionism.
Following the traitor Bennett, the rest of the lazy politicians will draw a line in the sand.
Even if you give me free flights, I'm not going near El Al, more like "A Shoe On"
It was very nice to meet you.
You won't see us in your dreams either.
Another great shame, we are in Israel captive by the company Allel all direct flights by pigs prices you better get out of here already, it's time for the skies to really open.4
Some of them are focused on this whole flying east thing.
Even if Saudi Arabia lets the Alel fly over its territory, then it won't add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, not a game changer that big.
It's better to focus on more interesting achievements like energy supply, purchase of Israeli technology, transportation from Ashdod and Haifa ports through Jordan to Saudi Arabia Qatar and the Emirates, tourism enabling Israeli companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
That's a lot more interesting than 30 planes a week saving an hour each.
More importantly, let the Air Force pilots be stationed in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran and arrange for the Emirates of Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Morocco to drop weapons on Iran non-stop for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And another squadron of the Air Force to deploy in northern Saudi Arabia and strike Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from the east from a less dense area.
After we're done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti and the Comoros to make peace with Israel and get most of the Arab League countries to join the peace.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdogan, it is also possible to help Saudi Arabia overthrow the regime in Qatar and finally eliminate the subversion of that country, and its support for the other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these mutual interests are done, we can talk about a few more flights of the A-Line if the A-Line survives until then.
Al should be shut down.
They're selling tickets for flights that don't exist.
The worst part is there's no way to get a representative
"No customer service" is a thing.
Anyone who buys a ticket to the El Al and wants to change or cancel it should forget about it, the loss is certain.
See you warned.
Air Canada is better.
They'd rather fly overseas anyway.
Earth has turned from a shithole of society to a hell of society.
They're down, too.
You better call a cab.
The driver will load the luggage for free.
And you sued the train to the field
40 euros for a suitcase in a Ryanair is much cheaper than a visa.
You can carry a backpack weighing eight kilos.
Why are you planting?
Wizz Air on cargo and sitting take much more significant!!!
One big whammy.
Just for example. I just came back.
The weight limit is 30 kilos.
And the seven-pound troll.
And every extra pound is 30 bucks.
Go get your shit together.
All the companies steal the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices, but it's a school bag-sized bag.
A trolley is already costing money and a suitcase is costing very, very expensive.
It's a good thing the airlines don't ask us to come on the flight with our underwear and our bodies so there's no weight on the plane.
In Al Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% off booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and are combinators, in a successful way.
A land that eats its inhabitants and eats.
Add to that a genetic stint.
It's also a shame for our country that allows foreign airlines to torment the Israelis...
There's no government and everyone here does what they want.
So what did you learn today that wasn't enough that you paid for a very expensive ticket...
They've prepared a surprise for us all.
You'll pay extra for the plane's wheels, for the windows, for the luggage that doesn't arrive, for the food, for the drink, and you'll probably pay extra for the toilet.
In short, leave it at home and the prices will go down.
Or big. Go out in boats.
A journey will take several days.
Throw up and then you'll probably get there too.
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and hurt Israel, and still have the right to locate and support his new fans.
Open it now?
It's not by chance.
When the mess starts, there's an exemption. It's just a delusion. What's going on here?
This is not the peak of the epidemic.
Simon, it's not like you.
The number of confirmed cases is increasing.
Stop getting checked out for all the crap. Stay home if you're not feeling well.
The story is over.
A government of lunatics.
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
And mostly stupidity.
And confused the public score zero
Just more damage than repair.
"The daily death toll has been accumulating since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The faces and pictures behind the default".
Your ratings will go down.
You don't understand the Treasury Secretary for not paying the tourist workers' fees.
From them, more contagion.
They don't care about the people.
8,500 have died so far.
Anything to that?
We're buried, especially the old ones.
We became Russia/North Korea.
If we don't talk about it - it doesn't exist!
The important thing is that the citizens put money into the state treasury to grow the cantor's horn and ass!
It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the Prime Ministers!
Very well, the Omicron suspension was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half the nation, and there is no point in trying to stop the Omicron - which is more present here than in Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, they're statistically less dangerous than someone who's already here.
This is the first time I've seen the Israeli government take any sensible steps in the fight against Corona.
It's like someone actually sat down and did the math, and not like Bibi did, did what he thought would look better in the paper.
The government of the dream at its best:
The finance minister who told the road builders to find a new profession two weeks ago, is rushing to open the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education is whistling at the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and is setting his own policy, which is throwing all the schools into complete chaos!
Foreign minister, clown who comes sick in Corona for a cabinet meeting.
And the most clownish Prime Minister we've had in this country, he's out of control and losing his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Just a government without leadership, without direction, in which the entire people of Israel have lost faith.
Go home and be one hour early!!!
I think maybe it came from a place of not good but a place of loss of control.
Now the prices of the apartments there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Come on, where are all the weather reports?
They're building a bus station and they think it's gonna affect every home.
Except for my sponsorship money, by the way.
The hotel will return to being a white elephant like before.
It looks amazing.
Good luck to you.
I want to.
How about art to be photographed completely naked?
Giving up the garbage
A serious fight for a field of choice
Why don't they give benefits to women in the occupied Galilee by the Muslim Brotherhood of the Harbinet?
All to the Calcunians.
In the present reality, the South is still ours?!
Do you need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
The members of the Knesset will probably be there too!
What about a people's hotel for a people's man?
Good for investing in the South.
Arad is growing and prospering and all due respect to the mayor who since the beginning of his term has been a boom for the good and glory of the city of Arad.
Cultural life, society, education and more on the rise
Just a great mayor who made this city better!
That's good.
I wonder how much endorsement fees the resort owner will pay for the Bedouins.
Have you got the money for the sponsorship?
Wow, that sounds good.
Who can afford to just go to a super company with the best service and security in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai?
Not on a tin company.
Neither socially nor economically.
In the last few weeks, she's cancelled flights back from overseas, you know, sending messages to the Israelis telling them that the flight was canceled, ruining the entire trip on the spot, telling passengers to leave a message on W.App or Messenger and come back, come back in two days or even three days.
The trip is ruined.
Besides it's better to land planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to Earth, and also prevent economic damage?
Are there any more suckers flying over?
I wouldn't fly with them for free.
Have they returned the millions of customers they've taken captive?
EasyJet to Geneva one way and back 70 euros.
Al, one way is $560.
The religious cheat who runs the company with his fucking son. I don't buy even 10 bucks, cheaters all the time.
And then the airline will cancel the flights and offer coupons that will be worthless.
Because their implementation will be in addition to the change in price.
Anyone who buys tickets by fraud puts their money on the wing.
A can company.
Low coast corporate drills.
No luggage, no seat selection, most likely no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all members of the Guerrilla... Up!
Nature is soft on fools!
