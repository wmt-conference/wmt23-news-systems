And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
- A letter from the occupation.
Kherson.
"Natasha, we are holding on with all our might.
It seems that they are afraid.
They are very afraid.
They can stop anyone on the street and make them repeat several times that they are great, that they are strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and our heads spin - how are you, s@Ki, afraid if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat about this greatness.
How unsure of yourself you are.
It's like having sexual intercourse with an impotent person, who needs to endlessly repeat that he is strong, that everything is working out for him, try very long and stubbornly for him and at the same time think about when this painful bullying will finally end.
We repeat this in order to save us all.
Because it is very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless torso with a machine gun.
Because then, when these evil spirits are driven out of our land, we will need to improve the city.
No matter who we're talking to right now, everyone has the same words.
Words that the city smells of rot.
We will probably need a lot of detergents just to wash sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time.Because everything these Inhumans have touched has a rotten smell.
Yesterday, a retired woman refused to repeat that they are big.
Three healthy men stripped her and left her on the street, forbidding anyone to approach her to help.
For three hours she stood naked on the street and only spoke loudly:
"Don't come near me, my dear ones.
Don't put yourself in danger.
Please!
We'll still have a lot to do with you...
Then!
And another.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It's hard for me to even think that they don't steal.
We've never seen theft on this scale.
Starting from children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid, because in the city they constantly put up leaflets.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the APU.
And when they are close, the Kherson residents will deal with evil spirits with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So hurry up.
We'll wait.
We'll wait.
Let's grit our teeth, clench our fists until our fingers are numb, and wait.
Because we have something to wait for.
To be once and for all.
And not a single one of these evil spirits remained.
And then we'll wash the city.
For a long time.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."

and I need communication. I'm completely limp. I know that few people want to communicate with sour people, but still I do not lose hope
How satisfied are you with your housing?
Do you need any help?
Do you work in the same specialty as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar issues are now reflected by the Ministry of Labor and social affairs as part of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The findings will help you get to know their situation better and plan the most effective help possible.
Data is collected through an online questionnaire.
All those who provided a functional email address when requesting humanitarian aid are sent an invitation to research (from the address запрошення@click4survey.cz).
The application form is filled out by everyone only once!
By filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!

I will be grateful for good advice and any help in my desire to do as much as possible for the residents.

On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the terms of payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all arriving Ukrainian refugees are eligible for first aid of 5,000 CZK, without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
To receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation – be considered unemployed, have no property in the Czech Republic, and so on.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice in this way:
1. the first payment of benefits will no longer be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, multiple meals a day and hygiene supplies, he will not be able to qualify for the payment of CZK 5,000.
The authorities will begin to believe that basic assistance was provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been completed and there is no need to pay money.
This event is designed to solve the problem of Roma refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for the sake of monetary assistance.
2. Only those refugees who prove their immediate need (lack of work, etc.) will still be eligible for cash payments of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth allowances.
However, two more conditions will be added:
як as in the first paragraph, only those Ukrainians who were not provided with free housing, daily multiple meals and hygiene supplies will be able to receive assistance in cash.;
the applicant must actually reside in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of "Tourism for the sake of help", when a refugee lives in one country, and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days solely for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is required to inform the Ministry of internal affairs about a change of place of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address in the benefit application form does not match the address indicated in the database of the Ministry of internal affairs, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she actually lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the payment of benefits will be refused.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent 2 2.626 billion on humanitarian aid payments. kronor.
And today I was engaged in digging up defensive structures all day, and the whole city is digging in, something is not very joyful forecasts for the near future.
To be honest, I am tired, it is very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, for this it is necessary for someone to organize equipment and people, and I am the headman of the village, then these are my duties
All utilities are involved, and we also appeal to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We need to unite, otherwise we will not overcome the katsaps
A lot of propaganda to make people despair and weaken their resistance
To be honest, I still did not take a shovel in my hands today, I hope that I will not have to
My children put girly stickers on my phone case so that I wouldn't forget that I was feminine
What happens if the bill is passed?
A government commission is being formed from representatives of the presidential office, some ministries and business associations, which will rapidly review the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
The commission and other executive authorities will review all permits for doing business in most areas by the end of the year.
And they will suggest which of the permissions or procedures should be removed.
The Cabinet of ministers will quickly remove all “unnecessary” permits and procedures.
Without any public discussion, behind the scenes!
It will not matter whether the Cabinet's decisions contradict the current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of economic activities that can harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
State regulation of business will be based on the principle of “one new permit – minus two old ones”.
It doesn't matter if it makes any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
️ ️ Behind the scenes, the Cabinet of ministers will be able to change any documents regarding permits or procedures in the field of the environment.
Forest Protection, wildlife protection, Waste Management, Environmental Impact Assessment, and more will be at risk!
Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We won't even know how or who changes bylaws until the final decisions are made.
️ ️ The only ones who will have access to information and the opportunity to influence are business associations.
Bill No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Short deadlines for reviewing permits, an opaque procedure, and the absence of any decision-making criteria are moving somewhere to the East, and not to the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the project
They told her – Baba, the Russians have come to the village; grab your cat and climb into the bus.
But she refused – SHO I, an old mare рят save the children and girls, I'll get killed here вже The Woman goes down to the cellar, scoops cucumbers, rolls back a tub of junk, a pile of troughs; there are doors – iron bolts and silver locks.
And behind the door, someone rattles chains.
I didn't think – says the woman – that I would live to see it.
Seventy - plus years-and again the rod.
Go-just not through vegetable gardens, because I will curse you, you will bring "Putin kaput"closer to us.
Babin's cat hisses, glass cracks in the windows.
Tanks Rumble and shove between houses.
Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Hello, go to the post office and confirm your identity via "check-in" then when confirming you will be given a code, and this Code must again be specified in the registration on the internet and you are ready.
The bank card must be registered to the person who wants to receive monetary assistance.the other card is not suitable.
I did so a friend also indicated that she needed some kind of key, but when she persevered, I waited in the government there they told her why she came because she was already registered.
She was also shown in this application that she needed some kind of key, but in fact it is already being registered without that
help me, the application was issued online on May 5, but something is not fashionable to understand whether to go to the government of labor or wait
it is written that you will receive money to the card after processing your application, but writes that the identity is not confirmed, through the banking system it gives an error
Good afternoon, dear Ms. Angelina!
I would like to express my point of view regarding the use of "B" / "on" in relation to the word "Ukraine".
The use of the term in recent decades has become a serious political issue.
Today's war between Russia and Ukraine was prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and Linguistic Policy
Thank you for interesting exercises and tasks, for a clear explanation of grammar, and for pleasant communication.
We especially thank you for the technical support of training, first of all, for the textbook, which allowed us to understand what was sometimes not learned in lectures.
These three months laid the foundation for our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish the entire creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions, he popularizes world classics in Ukrainian, among them "Lolita" (V. Nabokov), "perfumer" (P. Suskind), "sin" by M. Kotsyubinsky, "letter of an unknown" and "wild" by S. Zweig, etc. (etc.).
The works that he initiates are not easy to perceive, they require the investment of the soul and heart.
The author deliberately leads the audience to deep emotions and tears.
In his opinion, tears are purification, this is the way to recovery of a modern person.
He has a number of awards.
In 2005, he received the title of "people's artist of Ukraine", winner of the Taras Shevchenko National prize of Ukraine (2007), but most of all, Mr. Mikhail appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they return his love.
Connoisseurs of Mr. Mikhail's talent hope that at the end of the war they will hear him playing the saxophone again, see his unsurpassed skill of reincarnation, and be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art
Minerals of Ukraine
By Origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Therefore, their location is closely related to the structure of the Earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
Fuel minerals that are extracted in our country include: hard and brown coal, oil, natural gas, peat, and oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully meets its own needs for hard and brown coal.
But Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we create a rational economy, an acute shortage can arise in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polesie.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, agriculture, glass, porcelain and earthenware enterprises, and the food industry.
Various chemicals are also obtained from peat, in particular acetone, phenols, paraffin, feed, yeast.
There are considerable deposits of oil shale in the Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions.
The geography of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, so they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as in the marginal Foothill troughs.
Coal.
94.3% of our state's coal deposits are hard coal.
Ukrainian hard coal is of high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine, there are deposits of the best grade of coal — Anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of coal is coking coal.
After special processing, it is used in the smelting of cast iron and steel.
Ukraine ranks VIII in the world and I in Europe in terms of proven coal reserves, and XI and III in terms of production, respectively.
Proven coal reserves in Ukraine amount to about 50 billion tons.
The projected reserves are about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write "messages" on shells that are dropped on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
So, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the Eurovision stage to save the military blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol – and the very next day the Russians wrote on the shells "Kalush, as you asked! # to Azovstal".
On the Rockets used by the Russian military on April 8, 2022, it was written "for children".
Then 61 people were killed by shells with a cynical inscription, including 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared in the first World War.
During World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies.
Back then, it helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on shells by the Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor Army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they don't like the political course of Ukraine.
Russia needs to be stopped so that such "messages" do not fly to any other country!
The Vyšné Nemecké crossing met us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
"We are carrying insulin, it needs a temperature regime – it cannot heat up.
Can I pass the control in accelerated mode?»
The border guard allowed us to stand at the beginning of the queue, even the trucks gave way in a friendly way.
Lviv
The Lion City lives on.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body – an endless stream of people.
People from all regions of the country have found shelter and a sense of security here.
Someone goes further to Europe, someone returns home, someone stays.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at roadblocks around the city.
The war is reflected in the windows of cathedrals clogged with dictates.
It envelops monuments and sculptures with white canvases.
But the war is not heard in Rynok Square, where thousands of voices are heard at the same time, it is not heard in cafes and bars where people continue to live.
So, life subsides earlier-at 11 pm, life is hidden from curfew.
But it is there: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 pm and announced the alarm, it was only heard from a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people who live life.
Bucha, Irpen
We paved the way to Kiev through two of the many martyr cities-Bucha and Irpen.
Hero cities where the air smells of hope.
People, despite the pain, return and rebuild their lives.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Shell fragments or automatic bursts?..)
On the broken balcony – stretched Ukrainian flag.
There are holes near the front door, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And there are three people at that front door.
Clean, repair, build a wall and with it a new life.
And a mother and child are walking in the park two blocks below.
I can't help but ask myself, "did their dad survive the shootings of men in Bucha?
Will he walk with them again?»
At the exit from Irpen-Cemetery of cars.
These are the same cars that civilians tried to leave in and were mercilessly shot down by the Russian invaders.
This cemetery has already become an object of a kind of "patriotic tourism".
If you go deep and stand surrounded by car skeletons, you can feel a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow-moving air, it looks like it can be cut with a knife.
And it's been weeks since the passengers died…
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.
And in one of the cars – an abandoned bicycle, in the other – a warm children's jumpsuit.
Somewhere a little book with instructions for using the airbag was not burned.
Remnants of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
As we drive on, I look back for one last look at the city – and my eyes come across the very bridge under which the frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, but it was on these broken slabs that the Ukrainian military carried a baby in white.
This kid in the white jumpsuit probably survived.
But is there any chance that the child who was wearing the clothes left in one of the cars is also alive?
A man is sitting on a ragged bridge, a camera over his shoulder.
He just sits and looks at the abyss between Kiev and Bucha.
He doesn't take pictures, just looks at them.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge, and thinks: How is it?
"Happy Holidays!"- the man exclaims to us joyfully. - "Happy city day!»
On May 29, military Kiev celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, strong and independent.
Nikolaev
A hero City, an outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A frontline city that the invaders still can't capture.
And we believe that they will not capture – the city is fighting and living.
At the corner of the streets, at every second intersection – neatly stacked tires and Bandera lanes.
Evening Nikolaev is now incredibly quiet-the noise against which the city lived has subsided.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And at night it is extremely dark.
Blackout for security reasons.
People live "by candlelight", or rather, with mobile phone flashlights.
At home, we only turn on the lights in the kitchen – quickly and if necessary.
My grandmother has covered the windows with heavy blankets that don't let light through.
There's a hunting rifle by my sister's crib.
"At hand from the 24th," says the father.
When air alarms and explosions sound, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in a frontline city, it is very difficult to live in a constant alarm mode.
When then to live?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers from the city, shots from "peonies" reach the Oktyabrsky District, cover Kulbakino.
Several times he flies close to my family.
Next block, across the street from us.
To the neighbors of the grandmother-the grandmother's windows were taken out, the children took them to their home, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of the Ingulsky and Central Districts.
Life goes on.
On the central Sobornaya Street, a siren howls, and an elderly couple sits on a bench, talking about something, calmly discussing it.
A cyclist passes by them.
We look at each other with our dad – what are we going to do?
"Well... let's go get some coffee?»
So we sit on Sobornaya Street (formerly Soviet, by the way) in the park near the monument to St. Nicholas.
What else should I do?
To be honest, when a Siren takes you by surprise on the street, there is often nowhere to hide, no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every resident of Mykolaiv.
On the lawn at the entrance lies a huge Trident – once decorated with ODE.
Now there is an empty "nothing"left in the place where the Trident flaunted.
Just like on the site of the Office of the chairman of the regional state administration and a dozen offices around.
The rocket landed squarely on Kim's desk.
The war takes on a completely different shape when it is not in the news, but under your feet.
I walk along the corridors of the regional state administration, and with each step I hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor – someone submitted requests and applications, but now it doesn't matter.
On the desk of one of the surviving offices is a dusty makeup bag.
There's a flower on the nightstand.
They took her home, transplanted her, even if she lives.
We met a security guard who was on duty on March 29.
Survived.
"Mended, sewn up," he points to his head. "Already at work."
Only journalists can get into the regional state administration.
Together with us-a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, live broadcasts, and interviews.
According to official data – 36 dead.
This is "September 11 in Nikolaev"," monument to the Russian World", comments the press attache of the regional head.
The Nikolaev regional state administration is only one of the wounds on the body of Nikolaev.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even when Denmark will help restore the regional state administration, nikolayevets will always see in it a terrible emptiness.
Russia has started a new "gas war".
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transmission system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May – to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline.
Official Berlin expects that Russia will cut off natural gas supplies by this route in July.
Russia also used such blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the revolution of dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
Gas has always been not just a commodity for Russia, but an element of pressure on political issues.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the first priority is the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West.
Financing of the Russian economy is donations for the Third World War.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to quickly diversify their gas and oil supplies.
But it takes time for the EU to become energy independent from Russian energy.
Meanwhile, the Putin regime is intimidating Europe with an imminent energy crisis and a lack of heating in homes.
European countries, especially those dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may experience a shortage of fuel.
But this crisis will encourage a more economical attitude to natural resources and improve energy efficiency.
Europe will benefit when it abandons Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as geopolitical weapons.
Temporary discomfort should be experienced so that the next generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia burns crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary shells that destroy ripe crops of grain and oilseeds.
By doing so, Russia is causing the spread of famine in the world.
Because of the Russian war, the number of people in the world suffering from food shortages may increase by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, Russians steal already harvested grain from Ukrainian grain elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, and block sea exports.
The destruction of Ukraine's agricultural potential is another manifestation of Russia's military aggression.
So Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of digital development launches an innovative hotline format — The Diya virtual center.Business.
Internally displaced persons from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registering their own stay, registering a business, finding employment and receiving benefits.
Therefore, the virtual Action Center is launched.Business in order to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format, while Ukrainians can not return home.
It's scary how to be afraid of every important day, and how you never know a day or a minute that may come
Hello, Anna, can I ask you to call back to the pediatrician and ask when the next time you can come for vaccination for Darusya.
It should be tomorrow, I can't come because I need to replace the battery in the car, it will be there by the end of the week.
A neighbor brought a cable and we charged it from Marina's car.
But on the auto panel it says that you need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia should bring it from Ukraine, and then they will replace it for me
I will try to start the car tomorrow, if it works, we will go by ourselves, I will leave my grandmother in the car and will not turn off the engine.
If I don't start it, then I'll write to you and you'll come pick us up
I don't feel comfortable bothering you, distracting you from your work.
All right, we'll go with you at 11:45, so as not to take any chances.
"The war is not over yet, and the fate of our new neighbors is also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escaping to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure journey they embark on together to put them in hurriedly loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all adults who still don't quite understand why their parents stayed home.
Stories of children for whom the only memory of home is a toy that they could cling to during many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, the organizers emphasize.
At the end of each trip – return to the safe house.
But this trip is different, scarier.
This trip didn't end even after more than eight months.
A return home is expected.
The theme of war is ubiquitous, so our gait may seem redundant.
On the contrary, in the face of growing antipathies and hostility in society, which are inflamed and exploited by Narodniks, we want to note that unwitting travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in a poetic way and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
They are now part of it."
Despite such a painful theme, the parade was still made bright and encouraging.
This was done by craftsmen and craftswomen who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, motanok, houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade was held from Kampa to Vaclavak, and at each stop there was a huge performance, the drama of which was developed by the Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to preserve the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians face now," says the playwright. - Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects normal life, which is interrupted by an air attack.
Glowing birds are the first to come to rescue - they cover children with their wings first of all.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of protective wings becomes even more effective.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song spreads in a column.
And all the creatures came back to life: sunflowers, motanki, toys, and even houses.
Such symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who has helped and is helping Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we will be able to overcome this difficult path and security will reign in our homes."
The wife sends her husband to the market for snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, the man meets friends and gets into a binge for three days, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers about snails, goes to the market, buys snails, and comes home.
He thinks to tell his wife why he's been gone for so long.
He rings the doorbell, pours the snails on the floor, his wife opens them, and he pushes them with his hands and says:
"Well, here we are!
Come in, come in, come in...
Our editorial staff talked to Marina, a Ukrainian refugee who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.
"Now I'm trying to realize myself as an artist," the Ukrainian woman said.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, worries for relatives.
In a conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, there is confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she found herself with her children.
But the woman believes in herself and tries to adapt to life in Prague, without leaving the idea of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Marina is originally from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children – a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect in the state Nikopol institution.
"By education, I am an architect of buildings and structures, I graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk Academy of architecture with a red diploma.
Before that, she studied at an art school, graduated from the Lyceum with a degree in design artist, "Marina said.
And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians who fled the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina, without hesitation, left Ukraine with her children.
Prague became a shelter for the woman.
"Of course, a new city, big, crowded.a new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs tell me.
My knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
In addition, I do not hesitate to turn to the Czechs for help and have never felt any aggression from them.
Thank you to them for this," Marina shared.
According to her, people who have been living in Prague for a long time helped her solve issues related to finding housing, applying for a visa and insurance, and applying for benefits.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in kindergarten
Having received a visa of tolerated stay, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
"Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands.", – she said.
"They didn't take us to kindergarten because there are no places.
They say that we need to look for adaptation groups for children, but no one knows exactly where they are.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She tried to help me find a place in the kindergarten for children, calling a number of different authorities, but.", – continues Marina.
"In general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient.
I can't say that children interfere with me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to safely attend Czech language courses.
Once I went to a Czech class with the kids, so they played a little, and then they started to behave restlessly.
I, like a normal mother, was distracted, could not study normally.if there were language courses for adults with children or with small ones, someone was there during my studies. but my daughter is so attached to me," the woman sighs.
"Of course, together with our children, we go to various free events that were created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which we are very grateful to the Czech Republic," Marina added.
When the children are sleeping, Marina is engaged in self-education, learns Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
Once Marina was looking through vacancies on the internet and saw an ad: "as part of the initiative of the Association "Spolek Zaedno" with the support of the EC representative office in the Czech Republic "12 stars for Ukraine", we are organizing a one-day art workshop in the House of national minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.
Only creative imagination is required of the participants.".
Marina couldn't help but take this opportunity.
"I plucked up the courage and applied for participation.
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we drew all day.
Before that, I didn't sleep, I was worried.
In addition, I did not take a brush in my hands for six years," the Ukrainian woman said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large – format acrylic paintings were created on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists.
"The theme of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use the Ukrainian theme in our works-we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.
Therefore, the collection of paintings is dominated by blue and yellow colors," Marina added.
The event was attended by 30 applicants, of whom only 12 were selected.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings with the support of the EU delegation to the Czech Republic will be held in Prague with their participation.
"That's how it happens in life.
All your once-acquired knowledge and skills can be useful, and even support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," Marina said.
"And now I'm trying to realize myself as an artist.
Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
But we need to do something...", – said the woman.
Marina owes the Czech Republic for its hospitality and cordiality, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.

War destroys everything it touches.
And it will take a long time for Ukraine to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia started.
However, Ukrainians are not waiting for better times, and have already begun to clear their cities and villages of Russian garbage, restoring infrastructure.
The Kiev region took the brunt in the first days of a full-scale war, when the Russian invaders wanted to break into the capital and capture it in a few days.
These cities and villages survived active military operations, atrocities of the Russian army, and sometimes occupation.
In early April, the Ukrainian armed forces completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Alexander Khomenko collected photos from Kiev and the region, taken immediately after the active fighting and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public space.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia began a new stage of this war – information.
The Russian Federation is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce international support for Ukraine.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine fight the aggressor, and so they become accomplices in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report that the Ukrainian military is setting up positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure facilities.
At the same time, she ignored the fact that we are talking only about objects from which the civilian population was completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to information attacks of the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia has attacked Ukraine, seizes its territories, kills and tortures civilians, destroys cities and villages.
The Russian Federation is guilty of the war, it has no right to take any actions on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and knock the enemy out of the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine stand up to Russia on all fronts!
I'm sure every person in the world has ever dreamed of their perfect home.
Believe it or not, I'm no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.

The living room will become the most visited place in the house, where the whole family can get together, share news or just have fun.
That's why there will be a large sofa with small pillows, several armchairs, a chest of drawers, a huge TV and a long built-in aquarium.
Also, my ideal home would have an attic where we could make a home theater or entertainment room.
Behind my house there will be a swimming pool with several hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we can do exercises every day to keep fit or just engage in various team sports such as volleyball, basketball, soccer, etc.
My ideal home would be big and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I would love to live in it.
But this is just my dream ... I have to make it come true.

How football teams from Ukraine and Russia got into a fight in Turkey

In FC "Minay" claim that this is a fresh photo from the last training sessions after the fight with the Russians
In Antalya, Turkey, at a training camp, there was a conflict between players of the Ukrainian Football Club "Minay" from the Premier League and the Russian "Shinnik".
The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams accidentally settled.
Initially, the Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict that occurred on February 13.
The fight was then confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC Minay, the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
It seems that one of them was drunk and molested a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight really took place, but already on the floor where the Russians were staying, and in equal compositions.
The number of victims on the part of Shinnik only confirms the fact that the Russians also "throw" their own people, "the statement says.
The club claims that after the fight ended, the Russians continued the fight among themselves, and the local police had to intervene.
"Before the start of the training camp, the main requirement of FC Minay to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to settle Shinnik, "the statement reads.
Football journalist Roman Bebeh, who was one of the first to report on the situation on Twitter, posted a photo of the Ukrainian player who defended the employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that the conflict was provoked by the Ukrainians.
In particular, the Telegram channel Baza writes that representatives of "Minaya" approached the players of the Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian national anthem.
The Ukrainians denied this.
"The quantitative advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our guy.
Yaroslavtsy stood up for him and defended him.
There were five or six of us, there were much more Ukrainians," a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"The Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, among the injuries - a split lip, a broken toe and suspected bruised ribs," Kommersant writes.
"I don't understand where the Ukrainians could have come from in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine," Sergey Kulakov, General Director of Shinnik, was indignant in a comment to journalists.
Subsequently, Kulakov told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but stressed that they were not being evicted, they decided to leave themselves.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what does medicine for diabetics have to do with it
7 minutes ago
Injections, which are gaining popularity, help to lose up to 15% of weight, but have many side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell wegovy weight loss injections, which are used by some famous people, in particular, Elon Musk.
The main component of wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in Type 2 diabetes.
Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience in social networks, admitted to using it.
The drug is also popular among well-known bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other medications for treating Type 2 diabetes can actually contribute to weight loss.
By acting on specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, a person feels less hungry, gets full faster, and consumes fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick solution and not a miracle cure that helps you lose weight without any effort.
Treatment takes place under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and physical activity.
Like any medication, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or upset stomach, bloating, and gas.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to fat loss on the face, and in some people - to sinking cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
Doctors called this effect "Face Ozempik", from the name of another drug for the treatment of diabetes, which is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors advise taking wegovy for no more than two years.

In some sectors of the front, the Ukrainian armed forces managed to restore previously lost positions and gain a foothold there.
This was stated by the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny during a conversation with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff of the United States, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhny, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk direction, where the Russians carry out up to 50 attacks every day.
Fierce fighting continues in the area of Ugledar and Marinka, where, according to Zaluzhny, the Ukrainian armed forces are reliably holding the defense.
"Despite the constant pressure of the enemy, we continue to keep Bakhmut under control and take measures to stabilize the front line around this city," Zaluzhny said.
In a conversation with general Milli, Zaluzhny shared his concern about Russia's use of sea surface drones, which poses a threat to civilian navigation in the Black Sea.
Russian troops continue to squeeze the ring around Bakhmut after capturing Soledar.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut is "developing successfully"for his troops.
On February 11, the evening report of the General Staff stated that Russia was strengthening its grouping of troops in the Limansky and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and on the night of February 11, Russians attacked critical infrastructure in Ukraine in several regions.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from six o'clock on Friday evening until midnight, the Ukrainian air defense destroyed two dozen "shaheds" that the Russians launched from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile strike on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of the EU emergency summit.

The chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kiev with the greatest financial support.
"In the supply of weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone else in continental Europe," he added.

Russia launches major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW-DW-09.02.2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the study of war ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatovo-Kremennaya line in the west of the region has increased significantly over the past week, analysts ' report for February 8 said.
It also notes that geolocation footage of military operations confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvurechny northwest of Svatovo.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not allow the Russian Federation to achieve significant success
According to experts, the involvement of significant units of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces have not yet allowed Russian troops to achieve significant success.
The ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full pace, the Russian command has not yet put into operation parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after deployment in Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in the Luhansk region now have the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces set the conditions for the battle, ending the period of the Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full involvement of these forces may lead to their final climax on the Svatovo-Kremennaya line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions," the report says.
According to analysts ' forecasts, this climax is likely to create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces, which they can use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the Morning Report, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Russian troops, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive operations in five directions: Kupyansky, Limansky, Bakhmutsky, Avdiivka and Novopavlovsky in the areas of Kremennaya, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Marynka and Ugledar.

SpaceX has restricted the ability of the Ukrainian armed forces to control drones via Starlink-DW-09.02.2023
Adviser to the head of the Office of the president of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak on Thursday, February 9, called on the American company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kiev in the war unleashed by Russia.
Thus, he reacted to the information that Elon Musk's Company Limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite internet system.
"Companies must decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to a free life and Ukraine - and then they do not figure out how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its "right" to kill, seize territories," Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink doesn't have to be a weapon
On the eve of the Chief Operating Officer of SpaceX Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army actively uses in countering Russian aggression, "was never intended for use in the form of weapons."
"However, the Ukrainians use it in an unforeseen way, which is not part of any agreement.
We know that the military uses it for communication, and this is normal.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes," the director was quoted as saying by Reuters.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX may "limit their ability to do this."
"There is something that we can do, and we have already done," she added.
She declined to specify exactly what measures the company took.
SpaceX "traded" with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX handed over Starlink systems to Kiev for free to provide the population with internet.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue financing Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over this issue for itself.
It then estimated the necessary funding at 1 120 million by the end of 2022, and approximately.400 million over the next 12 months.
The issue of securing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, and in the European Union, but soon the owner of the company Musk said that SpaceX withdrew its request to the US Defense Department to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky believes that relations between Berlin and Kiev are developing "in waves" against the background of Russian aggression - they have "ups and downs".
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
"By nature, I am a fast person.
Others act more slowly, which may also be due to their bureaucracy," Zelensky said, adding that in war conditions, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every second.
Recovery from air defense
The president of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage, Germany's "conservative attitude" changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally got support from Steinmeier (German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier-ed.), with whom I previously had difficulties, especially because of the so - called 'Steinmeier formula', "Zelensky said.
He stressed that "good work" was done, which made it possible to change relations.
"We have received IRIS-T air defense systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives, " the president of Ukraine said.
According to Zelensky, Berlin managed to increase the pace of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T complexes to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate over the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kiev has returned relations with Germany "to a difficult phase," the president of Ukraine said.
He called the discussions on the issue "emotional and complex."
"I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this assistance is needed not by us, but by Europeans," Zelensky explained.
Categorical attitude towards fighters
After the allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kiev with battle tanks, discussions began on the transfer of fighters, which Ukraine insists on.
Here Scholz took a categorical position: Germany will never transfer combat aircraft.
At the same time, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kiev "as long as it is necessary."
He made relevant statements after meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of European Union leaders on Thursday.

The Moldovan government, together with Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilica, has resigned.
This decision was made after consultations with President Maia Sandu, Gavrilitsa said on Friday, February 10.
"After a year and a half of working in the government, it's time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, fighting corruption and integration into the European Union," she said.
According to her, during its work, the government "faced energy blackmail."
"They thought that we would give up and act like previous governments that betrayed national interests, but this was not the case. We worked in a continuous crisis mode, " Gavrilitsa said.
She did not specify the reasons for the decision to resign, referring only to the lack of "support and trust at home."
Sandu thanked the prime minister" for the huge sacrifice and effort, " also noting that Gavrilitsa headed the government during the crisis.
"Despite unprecedented challenges, the country was managed responsibly, with great attention and dedicated work.
We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and Bankruptcy," the Moldovan president said.

According to the law, the Cabinet of ministers will continue to perform its duties until the new government is sworn in.

What are the dangers of aftershocks?
Despite the fact that due to sub-zero temperatures in the region, hopes for saving people are becoming less and less, rescue operations continue.
So, 102 hours after the earthquake in southern Turkey, a family of six people was released from the rubble, the state news agency Anadolu reports.
A total of 166,000 Turkish and foreign rescuers, police officers, medics and volunteers are involved in the rescue operations.

In Turkey, almost 171 thousand tents were set up in the region affected by the tremors.
According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets were transferred to the crash site.
At the same time, in Syria, representatives of the non-governmental organization "White Helmets", who carry out a rescue mission in rebel-controlled regions, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a representative of the "White Helmets" said that only two small international teams of volunteers who do not have rescue equipment arrived in the region to provide assistance.
In addition, according to him, the region does not receive any humanitarian aid from the UN.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which operates in London and reports on events from the rebel-controlled northern regions of Syria, noted that one shipment of UN aid arrived in the region the day before, but it does not have shelter tents and equipment for clearing rubble.
About three thousand White Helmets volunteers are involved in rescue operations in northern Syria.
According to them, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people were found, more than 3.3 thousand people are considered dead.
More than 10 thousand were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
In the early morning of February 6, a powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.8 occurred in southeastern Turkey, as well as in northern Syria.
This earthquake was the most powerful in almost a century of observations.
The last time Turkey experienced tremors of this magnitude was in 1939, when about 33 thousand people were killed.
In less than 12 hours, the south-east of Turkey was rocked by a second powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.5, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

Cyprus hosts the decisive round of presidential elections - DW - 12.02.2023
The second, decisive round of presidential elections is being held in the Republic of Cyprus on Sunday, February 12.
Former Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides and former Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the UN Andreas Mavroyanis left it.
Conservative politician Christodoulides received 32 percent of the vote in the first round, while his rival Mavroyanis, who is supported by left-wing forces, won 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling Democratic Association party (DISY) Averof Neofit.
The DISY party, after the defeat of its candidate in the first round, could not decide who to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, the AFP news agency notes.
The president of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal suffrage.
He forms and heads the country's government.
The winner of the current election will serve as head of state for five years and become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of a coup backed by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the Turkish-occupied northern sector of the island declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Ankara.
The last negotiations on an attempt to reunite Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots participate in the elections-about 560 thousand people.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote on them.

Energoatom announces new threat to ZAES - DW-12.02.2023
President of Nnegc Energoatom Pyotr Kotin called the reduction of water in the Kakhovsky reservoir by Russians a new threat to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant (ZAES).
"There are a lot of threats at the ZAES.
The decrease in water in the Kakhovsky reservoir is a new added threat," Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the reservoir level is 13.8 meters at a normal level of 16 meters, "so that the station receives recharge for its generators, for turbine condensers and for security systems."
"In recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and is slightly increasing, as it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m," Interfax - Ukraine quotes Kotin as saying.
He explained that the Russians, who control the locks at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, began to discharge less water, while the inflow at the top of the Dnieper increased.
The president of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at ZAES is quite full and there is still enough water, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, this, according to him," will be a big problem for ZAES."
Kotin stressed that the critical level will be 12 meters, emergency - 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will not allow a critical situation.

The Russian and Ukrainian sides accuse each other of this, but there is no independent information about who is firing at the ZAES.
Israel to step up campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW-12.02.2023
Israel plans to step up its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, February 12.
"The government is meeting today to prepare for an even broader response to those who carry out terrorism," Netanyahu was quoted as saying by Reuters.
This statement came after the deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
Police shot and killed the man at the scene, and arrested and questioned members of the Palestinian's family.
Israeli law enforcement officers welded doors and windows in the home of a Palestinian family.
The next step after sealing may be the demolition of the attacker's House, writes AP.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot dead during a standoff with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired a rocket towards the Israeli border on Saturday evening.
The Israeli army said the missile was intercepted, reports dpa.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian Territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army conducts almost daily raids in the West Bank, leading to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported dead in their own attacks.
In addition, as a result of Palestinian attacks in 2023, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman were killed.
According to human rights activists, about 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022, making this year the deadliest in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis last year.
Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600 thousand Israeli settlers live there, the dpa notes.

Greek Foreign Minister visits Turkey - DW-12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - long-standing opponents, writes on Sunday, February 12, dpa.
On the same day, the two foreign ministers Nikos Dendias and Mevlut Cavusoglu held an unexpected meeting, where, as recorded by Greek television cameras, they even hugged.
Greece was one of the first countries to help Ankara
Cavusoglu thanked Dendias for being one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the disaster.
He added that both states will try to start a dialogue again and solve their problems.
"Greece's assistance to the Turkish people does not end there," the Greek Foreign Minister stressed.
According to him, Athens will "do everything" - at the bilateral level, as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit the disaster zone.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the Antakya and Hatay regions.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
Political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope for several days that the assistance provided by Athens to Ankara can be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members have already shown solidarity with each other during the strong earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This aid, known as" earthquake diplomacy, " helped achieve a certain detente.
Conflict over the islands
Athens and Ankara have been arguing for decades over sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
Ankara questions Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos and Kos.
Greece seems to be violating international treaties by maintaining its military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands with the threat of numerous landing ships on the Turkish West Coast and the right of every state to self-defense.
Read also: are Greece and Turkey on the verge of an armed conflict?
Turkey almost daily supports its claims with the flight of fighter jets over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country's leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Warming Ankara with Armenia
Against the background of the tragedy caused by earthquakes, there is also a warming of relations between Turkey and Armenia.
Ankara has opened a crossing closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia passed for victims of the disaster.
In addition, Armenia announced the dispatch of two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake that occurred on February 6 and claimed the lives of more than 33 thousand people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are strained for historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic murders in the Ottoman Empire during the first World War.
As the successor of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits that it exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian Genocide was condemned, in particular, by the United States, Germany and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the background of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation only worsened.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW-14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers has begun in Brussels, where a meeting in the so-called "Ramstein"format is also being held on Tuesday, February 14.
The agenda of the event is to further increase support for Ukraine in the war and increase the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting that NATO should provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war."
"We don't see any signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensives and new attacks," he was quoted as saying by Reuters.
"This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics," Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations on the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.

During the meeting, the ministers are expected to approve long-term guidelines for the Alliance's defense planning.
"The allies will discuss investing in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure," Stoltenberg said.
What to expect from the ninth Ramstein
On the same day, the US-led Contact Group meets at the NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, which is attended by Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexey Reznikov.
The head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry will also join the special session of the meeting of NATO defense ministers.
"More than 50 member countries of the Contact Group are united with you in this struggle for the sovereignty and self-defense of Ukraine," Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of the meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military and political leadership previously expressed the hope that at the next meeting of Ramstein, the partners could decide on the provision of Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kiev also expects that as a result of this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of the provision of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants to ban Russian artists from touring in the EU - DW-14.02.2023
Ukraine collects data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations funded from the state budget of the Russian Federation to include them in the new EU sanctions package.
This was announced in an interview with DW by Deputy Minister of culture and information policy of Ukraine Halyna Grigorenko.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
According to Grigorenko, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum very clearly says that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation,"says Grigorenko.
In her opinion, now a dialogue through culture with Russia is impossible.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, and musicians, the deputy minister of culture of Ukraine explained.
So, recently, the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DPR" in the Donbass.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour
However, according to Grigorenko, this is not enough and those representatives of the culture of the Russian Federation who support Putin's policy still manage to tour Europe.
"To officially cancel such tours, you need to have names in the European sanctions lists, "says Grigorenko, adding:" We are working to ensure that cultural figures of the Russian Federation who promote Russian narratives outside of Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible to officially ban their economic activities in the EU, in particular the holding of concerts."
According to Grigorenko, the Ministry of economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of corruption, the Ministry of culture and Information Policy and a special Working Group under the Office of the president of Ukraine deal with this issue in Ukraine.
As previously reported, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9 that he asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at a summit in Kiev.
She promised that many propagandists will be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of cultural and media figures of the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 surnames.

The United States is ready to sell HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment worth доларів 10 billion to Poland
The US State Department has approved the possible sale of about Польщі 10 billion worth of military equipment and services to Poland.
This was reported by voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin with reference to the Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
First of all, we are talking about launchers of the highly mobile artillery missile system M142 HIMARS with ammunition for them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such an acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member who is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe," the agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the purchased equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and deter regional threats."
In general Poland has submitted a request for the purchase of such equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of HIMARS boot module;
- 45 M57 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of the GMLRS Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
The agreement also includes rockets, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and equipment of Personnel, System Integration Support, Engineering and logistics services of the US government and contractors, training, sensors, and other related elements of logistics and software.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is an addition to the launchers purchased by Poland in the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw also requested rocket launchers from South Korea.
NATO Secretary General urges us to be prepared for Russia's long war in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine for protection in the war against the Russian Federation is not removed from the agenda, British prime minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.
"The first step in securing advanced aircraft is to have soldiers or aviators capable of using them.
This is a process that takes some time.
We started this process today, " Sunak said of the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
"Nothing has been removed from the agenda, and our leadership in this matter is something that we should all be proud of Together."
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks will arrive in Ukraine" next month "and said that Ukraine" should never again remain vulnerable to attack", and also called for"arming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term".
According to him, the UK agreed to expand its training program, which has trained 10 thousand military personnel over the past six months, and promised, as CNN writes, "to speed up the delivery of our equipment" to ensure that Ukraine reaches the front line in the coming "days and weeks, not years."
President Zelensky during a press conference expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: "today it is clear that we have the support of Great Britain.
Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity."
Also, speaking about the exercise program for Ukrainian pilots, he once again repeated the call for providing Ukraine with Western fighters and added that "I heard from Mr. Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighters" to Kiev.
The Russian Embassy in London has already said that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military and political consequences" for the whole world.
Now Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kiev continues to talk with Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: "I spoke with Dutch Foreign Minister Vopke Gukstra to coordinate our international steps as a full-scale Russian invasion approaches the annual mark.
I thanked you for the latest decision on tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on Combat Aviation."
The representative of the air forces of the armed forces of Ukraine Yuriy Ignat in a comment to CNN said that Ukraine will need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say that the West has a short period of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the expected new Russian offensive begins in the spring or even in February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin is already trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since the beginning of January.

Vaccination is hindered by "politics and profit"
The Director-General of the World Health Organization said on Sunday that if countries do not effectively use existing tools to combat the pandemic, it will not be possible to end it.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it," Tedros Adhan Ghebreyesus said, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the necessary tools - effective healthcare tools and effective medical tools.
But the world has used these tools poorly, " Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries around the world.
The obstacles to achieving the WHO goal of vaccinating 40% of every country's population against coronavirus are "policy and profit," the WHO chief said, "Not production."
"Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue in favor of COVAX and the African vaccine purchase fund," Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaboration initiative created for the fair distribution of the COVID vaccine.
Ghebreyesus also stressed that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperation to protect other peoples.
Together!"- said Gebreyesus on the social network Twitter.
The WHO official also called on vaccine manufacturers to "make it a priority and fulfill their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African vaccine purchase fund]" and become "much more transparent about what goes where".
AVAT is an African Union initiative aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to "share know-how, technologies and licenses and give up intellectual property rights."
Earlier, Karren Attia, a contributor to the Washington Post, called on the US administration to share with the world the "recipe" for the Moderna vaccine.
"The US administration has trumpeted the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, it's not kind-hearted philanthropy; it's arrogance.
Poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they initially asked for a fair opportunity," the observer noted.
"We're not asking for charity," Tedros said, " We're calling for smart investment in global recovery."
As Voice of America reported, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the abandonment of patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
Such a refusal should, according to the US administration, allow poorer countries to produce drugs that are analogs of patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, and others opposed it.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced higher prices for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Johns Hopkins University coronavirus Resource Center reported on Monday that it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, almost 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the decision to send F-16 aircraft to Ukraine will be a "very serious decision" that is "not easy to make".
This was stated by one of Ukraine's closest allies in an interview with CNN amid discussions about new arms supplies to Ukraine.
According to CNN correspondent Laura Kunsberg, in an exclusive interview in Warsaw, which will be broadcast on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16 aircraft would create a"serious problem "for Poland, because the Polish Air Force has less than 50 aircraft, and the Poles themselves" do not have enough of them... and we'll need a lot more."
Duda also stressed that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have a "very serious need for maintenance", so "it is not enough just to send a few aircraft."
These remarks by President Duda came amid discussions about new arms supplies to Ukraine, including Western tanks and longer-standing anti-missile installations.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has urged its NATO allies to send Patriot installations and Western-made tanks, such as German Leopard tanks, to Kiev.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made an unannounced European Tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with the means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelensky called Combat Aviation "wings of freedom" for Ukraine.
Zelensky repeated the same message in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelensky said that he was "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hopes that the next negotiations on providing Ukraine with aviation will also be successful.
"I have heard from some European leaders about their readiness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
Now I have a number of bilateral negotiations, we will raise the issue of fighter jets and other aircraft.
Therefore, we continue our work here in Brussels," Zelensky said.
As reported by voice of America, last week Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to transfer its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in" full coordination"with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Vopke Gukstra said his government would consider Kiev's request for an F-16.
Earlier this month, US President Joe Biden denied supplying F-16 aircraft from the United States, but Western experts believe that these aircraft can arrive in Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that earlier weapons that the United States refused to supply eventually got to Ukraine if European NATO allies agreed to transfer them.

Chisinau, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, the Moldovan president announced Moscow's plot to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country "at the disposal of Russia" and disrupt its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Mai Sandu's briefing comes a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had intercepted plans by Russian intelligence agencies to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.
"The plan for the next period involves the involvement of military - trained saboteurs disguised in civilian clothes, who will resort to military actions, attack some state buildings and even take hostages," Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The goal of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, change the legitimate government of Chisinau to an illegitimate one, "Sandu said," which would put our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration."
She promised: "the Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not be successful."
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has been trying to build closer relations with its Western partners.
In June last year, she received the status of a candidate for the European Union, on the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, the Moldovan police and the intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several cases of organizing criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence."
Moldova, which is not a member of NATO, has faced a number of problems over the past year.
Among them is a serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply cut gas supplies; rapid inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed its airspace and debris that was found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said that Russia wants to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the special services contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry to Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control," Sandu said.
She said the Moldovan parliament should pass bills to provide the intelligence and security service, as well as the prosecutor's office, with "the necessary tools to better deal with risks to the country's security."
The president added that the plan will "rely on several internal forces, but especially criminal groups," and continued the names of two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.
Last year, both men were sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom.
Last fall, a series of massive anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russian-friendly Shora party also rocked Moldova in the midst of an energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday came after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Doreen Rechan, to succeed Gavrilita.
On Friday, after the Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that " Russia has for years supported campaigns of influence and destabilization in Moldova, which often involve the use of corruption in the form of weapons to achieve its goals."

Weapons and military equipment withdrawn from storage in the Western, Central, and Eastern Military Districts and the Northern Fleet are being transferred by rail to the areas bordering Ukraine."
Details: the enemy did not conduct any active operations in the Volyn and Polessky directions.
There were no significant changes in the situation in these areas.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
There is still a threat of missile strikes by the enemy on military and civilian infrastructure facilities throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as provocations by the enemy on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine.
We abandon Soviet weapons and switch to NATO models-Zaluzhny
Commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny held a telephone conversation with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff of the United States, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.

Zaluzhny's direct speech: "we also discussed with my American counterpart a promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will complete it.
I also informed General Milli about the difficult situation in the east of our state, in particular in the Izyum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, maintain our occupied borders and positions."
"Whoever came up with this hellish summer was clearly out of his mind!" "what's that?" she complained, stretching her arms out as if to reach for the ghostly coolness.
"You say the same thing every time," the Guard said indifferently, stirring the ice in the cocktail. - In autumn-because it's raining and raining, the grasses are rotting.
In winter, because it's cold and the potion freezes out.
In the spring, it's raining again...
The guard shrugged indifferently.
Although she didn't really like the city either.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and fuss.
She liked to imagine the familiar streets as calm, quiet, and green as they had been a hundred years ago or earlier.
But there is no magic that would allow you to go back in time.
- Phah!
Say that!  The wildling clapped her hand on the table, and the flower vases rattled timidly. — You would have spent a week in the polonina with my grandmother Rutmeri and her colleagues, praying for every passing truck to take you away from there to any city.
Unless you liked to weed the beds from morning to night, sort out the herbs, hang them under the ceiling and at the same time sing old conspiracies.
Because the grandmother rested her horn that without words, none of my potions will be as they should be.
And wait, I haven't even remembered how to train all sorts of potorochi at night!..
Yes, where there, our beloruchka, you would have died, even a week would not have passed!
Through such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, and that they like this "job", that it is their conscious choice, and so on.
But if you really start to understand this topic, it becomes scary...
Now the problem of involving Ukrainian women in prostitution is particularly acute.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea to legalize prostitution... because of this, I didn't treat him very well.
I think that we need to learn from the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of "Swedish model"there.
In this case, they order not the woman, but the client.
Women are helped not to get out of this "business", but to make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything else.
Men should also think about whether they are buying "pleasure" or violence...
There is a need for something else... you can see where the nearest optician is with a doctor to write out a prescription for glasses.
And you need to buy a high-quality frame... I looked at some sites with frames, and was pleasantly surprised - it's cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about 3 300 for them, the frame was average (or even lower).
I do not know what frames are available in stores, but the prices in online stores are quite normal.
But as for some cosmetics, I can say for sure that it is more expensive here.
Cabbage soup a lot.
We have multifocal lenses in glasses are very expensive (this is when compared with our average salaries).
Considering the budget of our family (especially the fact that we need to rent a house), then 3 300 for points, then quite a high amount.
Have your doctors offered you an artificial multifocal Crystal?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then lens intolerance began, a year after that I wore hard lenses, and a strong allergy to almost all cosmetics began.
For 4 years now, I have been wearing glasses all the time, and I rarely wear lenses.
Yes, I also read that covid affects vision.
Also, after the age of 40, there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered Multifocal Glasses,the price was more than доларів 1000, then very very expensive.
Yes, glasses are fashionable now.
I asked one doctor why he doesn't wear lenses or get a laser correction, so he said that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of 1500 UAH - this amount is unrealistic
My glasses are now masking wrinkles
Yeah.
My mother has little work experience.
She did not work much: first small children who are often ill, then she took care of her grandmother... so the state gave her a minimum pension.
The Father receives 3800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8000 hryvnias and all these funds had to be paid for rental housing.
In good times (before covid), there were bonuses, but with the onset of quarantine, there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
Therefore, many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for their family or buy a cartira, but then communication with the family is lost...
Yes, there are advantages.
But my husband as has a day off, then cabbage soup goes to the apiary)
Good night
According to the order, from the date of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, and Kherson are closed until control over these seaports is restored.
It is indicated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the inability to service ships and passengers, ensure an appropriate level of safety of navigation and environmental protection during Russia's military operations in these regions that pose a threat to people's lives and health.
the Russian Federation is using a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
As an Ukrinform correspondent reports , this is reported by Reuters, referring to the statement of the British Foreign Office.
"The British Foreign Office on Sunday said that Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation on social networks about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including the United Kingdom and South Africa,” the article says.
It is noted that the Ministry of foreign affairs came to these conclusions on the basis of an expert study.
” The agency said the study exposed exactly how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign is operating, aimed at manipulating international public opinion about the invasion of Ukraine, increasing its support and attracting new supporters, " writes Reuters.
According to the study, the troll factory “used Telegram to attract and coordinate new supporters who later acted against Kremlin critics, bombarding them with comments in support of President Putin and his war.”
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
"Traces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok,” the report says.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Trass said her government has already “warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations .”
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadowy troll factories to break into our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war,” tras concluded.
Ivanna, I'll explain it to you now.
You have such a hair structure that all the hair is almost the same length.
Very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest possible result, you need to either do hair thinning.
But this will greatly affect the density of the hair.
That's why I didn't do it.
Or paint the roots to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I also did not paint the roots.
So the transition can be a little abrupt.
I can smooth out the transition for you, but you'll need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be colored to match your color, so when the hair grows back, you will not notice the difference.
About the quality of your hair.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
Your hair may become drier, which is normal because it's blonde.
Without losing quality, such a blonde can not be made.
If you do proper hair care, the condition of the hair will return to normal.
Please write down what kind of Matrix care you use.
Perhaps for a blonde, it is too weak.
We can sign up for free tinting to make the transition smoother.
This photo also shows a rather sharp transition.
Because a large percentage of blonde hair is in the root zone.
Please write me when you can drive up so I can take a look.
If we do tinting, it will take about three hours.
A lot of positive things from what I do at work.
I help people-this is the most important thing and I wanted it.
Let it be in this way, but this is helping people who almost no one in the world helps at all and will not say "Good Day"with a smile of the heart.
I found great basic Czech language lessons on the internet today.
I am here in the morning cleaning the rooms where the silent people sleep, at this time I am alone and the doors to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons with my headphones on and repeat them after the lecturer.
From the outside, I speak to myself, but it's good that no one sees or hears me at this time.I think I can learn the language like this for an hour a day.
So another huge positive of this work is learning the language with headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues.
Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
Its longest peace period lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
Most of the modern territory of Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural background of Russians.
The cult of conquest and raids has been a success throughout the history of Russia: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then – 20 years of the Putin regime.
These cultural characteristics have shaped state institutions that cultivate policies of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of a war of conquest, because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet fully felt the consequences of economic sanctions.
Their standard of living has not worsened enough to provoke mass protest movements inside the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand tougher sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia poses a threat to the new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military is firing and seizing nuclear power plants on the territory of Ukraine.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was de-energized.
They fired from tanks and took control of Zaporizhia NPP, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also detected over the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant in the Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacking nuclear power plants.
A rocket hit, reactor overheating, or spent fuel due to power and water outages can lead to radiation leaks.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia does not have to press the "red button" to cause a catastrophe on a planetary scale.
Support Ukraine-the Russian threat can only be overcome together!
Russians Rob Ukrainian farmers and illegally export grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and the first crops from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a conscious policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory decided to "expropriate the surplus crops of the past and this year" from the south of Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take seed material from farmers, but at the same time demand that they successfully carry out the sowing campaign in order to send new crops to Russia later.
Prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, he threatens you with physical violence.
Russia repeats the Soviet policy of mass looting of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
Thus began the Holodomor in 1932-33 and private property on Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of a "war of liberation with the Nazis", Russia, in particular, provokes famine in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor in the International Food Market.
Don't buy Russian products!
And demand that your country refuse any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers are taking children hostage in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine.
They force their mothers to find out the locations of the Ukrainian military, and threaten to kill their children for refusing.
People are forced to make a tough choice: lose their children or become traitors to the motherland and be punished for it.
Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine Lyudmila Denisova has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphaned children by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated changes to the legislation "to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbass."
Call on your authorities and the international community not to allow the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don't like their indecision.
Due to the fact that NATO does not close the sky over Ukraine, thousands are dying.
More than 50,000 civilians have already been killed.
However, without Western weapons, we would be powerless, but I must say that they also come in insufficient quantities and with a delay.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think that this is also beneficial for the alliance itself, because with weapons from NATO and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe
Did you know that the Ukrainian was invented to reload the "one-time" nlaw anti-tank system?
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage
Russians deserve all the worst and worst that you can imagine.
So to some extent, I am happy with what is happening.
Because this war has not been going on for 4 months, it began around the 15th century, I don't remember exactly now.
But all these hundreds of years there has been an attempt to make us their slaves.
No sooner does one generation die than another is born and takes the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished, and now they have returned to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state
In general, it is wild for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the transience of events, I didn't even have time to reflect on the very fact that there is a war going on and what it means to me
Here is super,but you need to learn the language and go to work I will not be able to sit on the support of the Czech state, but the problem is that my husband does not want me to sew constant quarrels to work.and we will have to return to Ukraine and we could have stayed, but he will do everything for us to go back.very difficult situation
Doesn't want us to live here that's his answer
So he is glad that we are here but to stay at home all the time I myself took the children to school and swimming, I ask that we stay here after the war and he says that we will immediately go home ,he will not make us documents
I probably won't be able to leave myself if he has a long job,and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic
Long beat
I want to learn to be a hairdresser when the war is over and then I'll tell him to take us to the Czech Republic if he doesn't want to then he'll probably have to go to a lawyer.it's too early to do anything now.but then he clearly told us that after the war we were going home right away.
We will go home ,but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic ,and when we lived in Ukraine, he said that he would take us))) well, now I know the truth
Yeah .thank you.we will get out of the situation ,the main thing is that the war ends!!!it's gonna be okay.!!!
No, he doesn't currently have anyone, that's for sure.I think the reason is that children want a lot in the Czech Republic,ask him for toys ,then go to McDonald's, shout, run around the House.and he is used to the calmness that no one bothers him and does not ask for anything lower.and then we arrived and everything annoys him and we need to spend money on us and he is very economical.then it is better that we live in Ukraine.
Outside the window of the train fluttered, dusted with a fine gray rain, birch and spruce forests, strewn with black and white confetti Magpies, sad watercraft and freight trains.
Comrade orlrv was lying on a narrow Spartan bed, familiar to him because it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed he had at home.
He unwrapped a simple set of second – hand items-rye bread and lard wrapped in a gray cloth.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and in life he was unpretentious, he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simply, because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he bent over an old battered valise and carefully took out the Crystal Dome, which gleamed dully in the gray light of the middle lane.
"What Have you got, comrade?"  the young cadet, his neighbor, asked in fright.
"A rarity," comrade Orlov said with a tenderness that was unexpected for himself, placing the skull securely on the compartment table, " such, you see, a thing.a very interesting and flammable thing.
This is, you might say, my friend…
Yes, I look at the work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately, I find a job for men, for special education.
I do not know Czech, I am a teacher of small children, I am not an engineer and I do not have a driver's license.
And also a big question to find housing.
This is my first time abroad and I just don't know what to do or how to act anymore.
I haven't been able to find a job for a month, just cleaning one house.
I understand that the situation in Prague is very difficult, so I don't even go there
Here I have problems anywhere 😭 this is my first time abroad, I don't know the language and I'm all alone.
I and 20 other people were fired by the agency after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find a job anymore.
I ask people, look at websites - nothing
I take a course in this village.
One lesson a week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, now the situation is such that I have to hold on to free housing while it is available.
And watch the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options ((
I don't want to just sit there because housing won't be free for long.
I understand
I don't want to charge you.
I don't want thoughts about lazy people from Ukraine to affect others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in an ordinary city, not in the capital.
The hard road from Ukraine for three days and a big city where a foreign language scared me very much.
I didn't come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Perhaps you know someone in small towns?
I can take care of children, cook food, clean, work in the garden...
I can sew, I have training to sew on a sewing machine.
I made custom-made bed linen and some clothes.
Perhaps there will be such work.
I can do it!
I hug and send congratulations to everyone!! 🙏🏻🤗🤗🤗💐🌞
I am very happy to read you!
We now have an air alert again(((
Today, more than 100 missiles arrived in Ukraine 😡
I was working with the wounded today, so it was difficult to concentrate.
All thoughts were with the child.
Jan studied at home...
Everything will be Ukraine!
We will give these evil spirits!
In the surgical department, my colleagues and I volunteer
Sometimes covers of course))))
Then I clean, cook, communicate))))
Because this is my home, my land!
Send congratulations to everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! 🙏🏻💐🤗
Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the question of withdrawing or not withdrawing the Association of Russian psychologists of European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is the main thing.
I'll give you an analogy.
If one child takes a toy from another child in the sandbox, then most likely adults who look after children will try to reconcile the children and after some time the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox starts hitting another in the face with a spatula, then such a child will be isolated for a long time, and no one will play with him.
I also liked the analogy of a Russian colleague-psychologist about the fact that when someone from a neighboring apartment kills someone, they don't put the entire apartment building in prison.
Among Ukrainian psychologists, there is a lot of discussion about the exclusion of Russian associations from European ones.many people feel how painful it is that they cannot withstand communication with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue working with several psychologists from Russia that I know, and share my knowledge in order to treat the injuries of clients on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who at their own level are trying to do many things for the development of universal values in Russia.
Therefore, I am definitely in favor of a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia the war is supported by 5-10% of the population, and the rest of the figures in opinion polls are completed by propaganda.
My wife left her native homeland of Ukraine because there is a war going on there.
My wife had a good job, and no matter how much the war went on, she never left her home.
In order not to sit on the neck of my wife in the Czech Republic, she is trying to earn money, because once in 2009 she received a certificate of completion of masseuse courses in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money as best they can.
Now the only problem is to learn Czech.
The wife learns languages and works and earns herself and her child for food, kindergarten, a bus ticket, mobile communication services for clothing.
Meanwhile, I am defending my homeland.
Thank you for supporting people who understand this.
Thank you to the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine in a difficult time. 🇺🇦❤️🇨🇿🤝✊
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to advertise my wife for providing massage services in your community.
My wife earns money on her own because she doesn't want to live off the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you
I am sincerely grateful to you.
It really helps my wife make money for her family.
All right, I'll tell my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of the Ukrainian people.
Some people smile at my wife's ad, but my wife offers her services.
My wife in Ukraine was a nurse, I work in the police, but the war separated us.
It is good that my wife wants to work and earn money and does not expect help from your Republic.

Distance learning rules
If this is not possible due to the introduction of an emergency measure or the introduction of quarantine
personal presence of students in the school, the school provides interested students with distance education.
If the distance learning method is ordered from a school (class), students are required to do so in this way.
The most important safety rules
In particular, it is forbidden to bring items that threaten your health and safety to school and school events

I really need someone who can act as a translator for a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were driving to Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we're dealing with an insurance company to fix the car.
The insurance company invited a person who can translate from Czech to Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa during a technical inspection of the car.
Can you tell me if you can help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific paper based on statistical analysis of the body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a separate population.
In addition, I also have experience working in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in research at the Kharkiv bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped monitor bat populations in the Kharkiv region, as well as organize wintering grounds for bats that were disturbed by people in the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in the important topic of biodiversity conservation for me.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to get acquainted with scientific works on tardigrades, observe their vital activity under a microscope and communicate with scientists who study them.
Therefore, the option of a deeper study of these and other microscopic organisms also interests me.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees-expert analysis
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive refugee assistance from the EU – this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.
The Czech president noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.
It provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
About 500 thousand people arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors-Poland and the Czech Republic – and will thank you tirelessly!
The editors of Proukrainu asked Jaroslaw Kot, coordinator and translator of the refugee center in Lublin, how Poland is experiencing the unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden.
He is also the founder of the Institute for global and regional Analytics, which has a representative office not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic received up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the life of the Czechs.
Labor governments have long queues, significant price increases in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began providing assistance when hostilities broke out.
This was predicted.
In Poland, they have said in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, they prepared less for what would happen, while in Poland they actively prepared.
So, for example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the war began, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be placed.
In Ukraine, they didn't even think that this could happen.
I heard that they smiled at Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very balanced: to prepare for all these events before the war began.
I note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombing from the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance in logistics – movement on the territory of Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.
These are planes that move between cities in Poland, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I have had experience working with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not millionik, as some might think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, travel fees for Ukrainians have been canceled.
They can travel for free on trains and public transport.
In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers that organized free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
In other words, refugees have the opportunity to travel free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
For the most part, these are closed School small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
Free meals and free medical first aid are organized there.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there on the spot they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
The big cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, and Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian neighborhoods have now been created.
The example of Warsaw is generally unique in the sense that they got the Russian embassy to take away objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes have been in a neglected state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone in there.
The Polish local authorities nationalized it, let's just say.
I took it in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
Water and electricity will be supplied there, and they will be insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step – the Sejm adopted and the Senate approved a law on fugitives from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medical assistance to Ukrainians.
You just need to write a text message and get the code to your phone.
And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias to get medicines for free in Poland.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.
Various funds are distributed, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which give packages with food, chemicals, and clothing.
As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".
That is,"an event that has no analogues".
Such a huge openness.
This is a huge expense for the Polish state.
The European Union has not yet allocated a single euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
Language problem.
Questions start from polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems and illnesses.
The second problem is that schools where students, especially high school students, also do not give themselves any advice at all at the beginning, they cannot understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often come with a much higher level of knowledge than in the corresponding class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children not only have a good command of English, but in general their level is higher than in the class they enter.
This is also interesting.
In other words, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, or lawyer in Ukraine is much more difficult to master here.
As a lawyer or accountant, I don't know any such cases at all.
Doctors now appear in certain places, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small Polyclinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians legally.
A language problem is often the reason that encourages families to return home after a few weeks of being here.
There are a lot of such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, and now they are coming back.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military operations.
They didn't get used to it, they didn't find a job.
Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, it is more convenient for them to return home.
This is also one of these problems that has been emerging in recent weeks.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed
According to the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, significant changes have taken place.
If earlier the Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles feel about millions of Ukrainian refugees?
Poland has a similar situation.
Here, all TV channels often quote the statement of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When there were events of the Russian attack on Georgia, together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.
There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then maybe Ukraine.
Then there may be the Baltic states, and it may reach Poland.
That is, if he had foreseen it.
In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their loyalty, and their heroic deeds.
Poland and poles appreciate this, which is why they open their homes and help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.
They see the threat in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is a member of NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also come knocking on our doors.
Therefore, the attitude has changed to a positive one.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian national anthem is no longer a “song of nationalists” or any enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are still small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they exist in every country.
But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.
The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
This is perceived simply with laughter in Poland, because these so-called “nationalists” turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political overtones.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in the public opinion of those segments of society who still doubted some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as much as is happening now in Ukraine.
Here they constantly talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.
How does Poland perceive Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst-case scenario, because there is a terrible war going on.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.
Russia fears that it will strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How does the Polish government and society react?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
Currently, additional recruitment to the Territorial Defense Forces is taking place in Poland.
In other words, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
It is noticeable for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.
Among this is the recently adopted new law on defense of the Fatherland, where the budget is significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.
The requirements for recruiting military personnel have been changed, and there are many issues that are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.
Your predictions have become a reality in Syria, and you warned about a Russian attack.
What do you say from the analysis of the situation: when Will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for a nuclear strike, I don't really believe it.
But there is such a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well.
It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.
I'll note that I wouldn't want to, but this is the worst-case scenario.
A low-power strike, but so that all TV channels show this “fungus”.
To be seen from Poland and the Baltic states.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are associated with the exhaustion of the physical and financial Russian army, the problems of Putin's entourage, oligarchs who are now suffering greatly from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.
We have the facts of the fire of a hydroelectric power station on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.
Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia will break up into 19 small countries.
We also have tendencies to settle the war peacefully.
Various EU countries, in particular Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.
This will be delayed as much as possible until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing a possible termination of gas supply.
This will be a very significant blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia has completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Since I'm an analyst, I predicted this.
I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.
My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there are a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the price increase.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely prices for all resources will start to rise up.
Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.
In addition, there are already several companies that carry liquefied gas to Poland, and there is a very huge port in Poland.
As for oil, we have a striking factor that the Hungarian Prime Minister is actually cooperating with Putin.
Currently, there will be a purchase of gas stations in Poland, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that relate to geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe abandoned Russian energy sources, it would be the loss of the Russian Federation's source of funding for its troops.
Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish media
Vladimir Zelensky gave an interview to the Polish media.
What do the Polish media say about this?
The rating of the president of Ukraine has grown very much.
And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.
Vladimir Zelensky thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in a war zone.
In other words, the president's actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.
They show that the Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused on receiving military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity that sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.
You can't hear it here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, endurance, and the ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.
It doesn't fade or fall off.
This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.
In fact, the image of Ukraine holds up, and this is very important.
Good Morning.
I'm sorry to Bother You with my problems again.
I am very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
Yesterday we tried to come to something, but the attempt was in vain.
My mother-in-law's girlfriend, who helped me find this apartment, also joined the conflict.
She said that she was not looking for her for us, and if something does not suit us, it is we who should leave and she will make sure that it is her mother-in-law, and not us, who stays here to live.
Unfortunately, none of them think for a child who is used to this place, considers it their home, and in 3 months of shift there are already 6 houses.
I am very sorry, I could not even guess that such a situation would happen
Once again, I'm sorry to Bother You.
As for the bed, the situation looks strange.
My husband and I discussed this issue before I wrote to you that you don't need a bed.
He came here to see me and the baby and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And her mother-in-law decided for herself that he would sleep with her in the room and she didn't care about his opinion and desires.
I am very ashamed in front of you, your husband, Sharka and Jan, the owner of the apartment.
You tried so hard for us
Got it.
I thought it was going on for a long time .
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andrey's treatment , to do this at least until the end of the summer ?
You may need a certificate for Andrey that he is ill .
In Ukraine, a disability would be prescribed with such a diagnosis..
And since Inna does not go to kindergarten yet, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work , at least outside the House
I understand, then it would be nice to go with you tomorrow .
I will make a barcode for myself and Andrey
I am worried that they will stop providing humanitarian aid for him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a long time.
Can you give me some advice?
I also wanted to ask if you received money for the medicines that you bought for Andrey?
The handle Mount falls out.
It is short, so you need to be very careful not to lose it.
Only 2 servings were sold today.
The apricot is over.
I filled it with mango.
Mango doesn't go very well.
Most wanted apricots.
Now they take more vanilla, because they don't like mango.
Norm, Go Mango.
But it started creaking again😭
Actively began to take ice cream and he can not cope😭
Tomorrow there will be black currant
Today will definitely end mango , and black smoro
I'm shaking all over😭
It freezes again, creaks.
Hadnes on 4.0.
As soon as people actively take it, he does not let ice cream in at all.
😭😭😭
Just as soon as the queue becomes for ice cream ,it starts to give out such nuances and people move on.
Freezing .
If there is no ice cream alone, it will creak and rub the plunger.
And vanilla in mango can not be poured.
Magdalena can come tomorrow at 8: 00?
I need to wash the ice cream.
Today the ice cream is over, and tomorrow it tastes different.

people wanted to leave the Soviet Union and left
Maidan is a place where people protest
Mykola Mikhnovsky first read the text independent Ukraine in 1990
It was an ordinary man who fought for the independence of Ukraine
Leonid Kravchuk first president of independent Ukraine
I believe that there was a dictatorship because people just left Russia and still couldn't really understand whether they like being an independent country or whether they want to be an autonomous Republic of Russia
when there was an independent Ukraine there was already Kiev but still in the Soviet Union there was the city of Kharkiv from 1912 to 1934
I can't say that there were any other interesting events but if at first there was democracy it was much better and probably now we were in the European Union
